10.1002-14651858.CD000371.pub7-abstract.txt,"Deworming school children in low‐ and middle‐income countries
Cochrane researchers examined the effects of deworming children in areas where intestinal worm infection is common. After searching for relevant trials up to 19 September 2018, we included 50 trials with a total of 84,336 participants, and an additional trial of one million children. 
What is deworming and why might it be important 
Soil‐transmitted worms, including roundworms, hookworms, and whipworms, are common in tropical and subtropical areas, and particularly affect children living in poverty where there is inadequate sanitation. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends that school children in many areas are regularly treated with drugs which kill these worms. Some advocates claim such programmes improve child growth, haemoglobin, cognition, school attendance, school performance, physical fitness, and survival. 
What the research says 
In populations of children living in endemic areas, the effect of the first, single dose of deworming drugs on weight is unclear. There was little or no effect in most studies, except for a large effect detected from one study area in Kenya, reported in two trials carried out over 30 years ago in a school where children were heavily infected with worms. This causes uncertainty, which means we do not know if a first dose or single dose of deworming impacts on weight. For height, most studies showed little or no effect, with the exception of the site in Kenya. A single dose of deworming medicine probably has no effect on haemoglobin and cognition. There is insufficient data to know if there is an effect on school attendance, school performance, or physical fitness or mortality. 
In studies where children were regularly treated with deworming medicine there was little or no effect on weight in all but two trials, irrespective of whether children were heavily infected with worms or not. The two trials with large average weight gains included the Kenya study carried out over 30 years ago, and one study from India carried out over 20 years ago in a low worm burden area where later studies in the same area did not show an effect. In trials from 2000 onwards, which are more relevant given the global reduction in worm burden, there is little or no effect. This causes uncertainty and means we do not know if regularly treating children with deworming medicine improves their weight. Regularly deworming children probably has no effect on height, haemoglobin, cognition, and mortality. We do not know if there is an impact on school attendance, since the evidence is inconsistent and at high risk of bias. There is insufficient data to know if there is an effect on physical fitness. 
Authors' conclusions 
For public health programmes to regularly treat all children in endemic areas with deworming drugs, there is quite substantial evidence of no benefit in terms of haemoglobin, cognition, school performance, and mortality. For weight, contemporary studies do not show an effect, but unusually large effects were seen in studies over 20 years ago. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Deworming School Children in Low- and Middle-Income Countries

## Plain Title
Does giving deworming medicine to school children in poor countries help them grow and stay healthy?

## Rationale

**What are intestinal worms and why are they a problem?**

Some children get worms living in their gut. These worms include roundworms, hookworms, and whipworms. Children get these worms from dirt that has the worms in it. This happens most often in hot places where families are poor and do not have clean toilets or safe water.

These worms can make children sick. They may cause children to feel tired or weak. The worms may stop children from growing well.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

The World Health Organization tells many schools to give all children medicine to kill these worms. Some people believe this medicine helps children in many ways. They think it helps children grow taller and gain weight. They also think it helps children do better in school and miss fewer school days. Some believe it helps children think better and be more fit.

Researchers wanted to find out if giving this medicine really helps children. They looked at many studies from different countries to see what happens when children take deworming medicine.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this?**

Researchers looked at 51 studies. These studies included over 1 million children total. The studies were done in areas where many children have worms.

The studies looked at school-age children living in poor areas. These areas were in hot parts of the world where worm infections are common.

Some studies gave children one dose of deworming medicine. Other studies gave children the medicine many times over months or years. Researchers then measured what happened to the children. They checked if children gained weight or grew taller. They tested if children did better in school. They looked at school attendance records. They also checked other things like how well children could think and how fit they were.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

**After one dose of medicine:**

Most studies showed the medicine had little or no effect on weight. However, one very old study from Kenya from over 30 years ago showed a big effect. That study was done in a school where children had many worms. This makes it hard to know if one dose really helps with weight.

Most studies showed little or no effect on height. Again, only the old Kenya study showed an effect.

The medicine probably does not help with blood health or thinking ability. Researchers do not have enough information to know if it helps with school attendance, school work, fitness, or keeping children alive.

**After many doses of medicine given regularly:**

Most studies showed little or no effect on weight. Only two old studies showed big weight gains. One was the Kenya study from over 30 years ago. The other was from India over 20 years ago. Newer studies from the year 2000 and later show little or no effect. This is important because children today have fewer worms than children did long ago. The mixed results make it hard to know if regular deworming helps with weight.

Regular deworming probably does not help children grow taller. It probably does not improve blood health, thinking ability, or keep more children alive.

The evidence about school attendance is mixed and not reliable. Researchers do not have enough information about fitness.

**What do these results mean?**

There is strong evidence that giving all children in these areas deworming medicine does not help with blood health, thinking ability, school work, or keeping children alive. For weight, newer studies show no effect. Only very old studies from over 20 years ago showed large effects. These old results may not apply to children today."

Bottom line 
The available evidence suggests that a course of acupuncture consisting of at least six treatment sessions can be a valuable option for people with migraine. 
Background 
Individuals with migraine have repeated attacks of severe headache, usually just on one side and often with vomiting. Acupuncture is a therapy in which thin needles are inserted into the skin at particular points. It originated in China, and is now used in many countries to treat people with migraine. We evaluated whether acupuncture reduces the number of episodes of migraine. We looked at the number of people in whom the number of migraine days per month was reduced by half or more than half. 
Key results 
For this update, we reviewed 22 trials with 4985 people, published up to January 2016. We omitted five trials from the original review because they included people who had had migraine for less than 12 months. We included five new trials in this update. 
In four trials, acupuncture added to usual care or treatment of migraine on onset only (usually with pain‐killers) resulted in 41 in 100 people having the frequency of headaches at least halved, compared to 17 of 100 people given usual care only. 
In 15 trials, acupuncture was compared with 'fake' acupuncture, where needles are inserted at incorrect points or do not penetrate the skin. The frequency of headaches halved in 50 of 100 people receiving true acupuncture, compared with 41 of 100 people receiving 'fake' acupuncture. The results were dominated by three good quality large trials (with about 1200 people) showing that the effect of true acupuncture was still present after six months. There were no differences in the number of side effects of real and 'fake' acupuncture, or the numbers dropping out because of side effects. 
In five trials, acupuncture was compared to a drug proven to reduce the frequency of migraine attacks, but only three trials provided useful information. At three months, headache frequency halved in 57 of 100 people receiving acupuncture, compared with 46 of 100 people taking the drug. After six months, headache frequency halved in 59 of 100 people receiving acupuncture, compared with 54 of 100 people taking the drug. People receiving acupuncture reported side effects less often than people receiving drugs, and were less likely to drop out of the trial. 
Our findings about the number of days with migraine per month can be summarized as follows. If people have six days with migraine per month on average before starting treatment, this would be reduced to five days in people receiving only usual care, to four days in those receiving fake acupuncture or a prophylactic drug, and to three and a half days in those receiving true acupuncture. 
Quality of the evidence 
Overall the quality of the evidence was moderate.
","# Plain Language Summary: Acupuncture for Preventing Migraine Attacks

## Plain Title
Can Acupuncture Help Prevent Migraine Headaches?

## Rationale

**What is migraine?**
Migraine causes very bad headaches that come back again and again. The pain is usually on one side of the head. Many people also feel sick and throw up during a migraine attack. These attacks can make it hard to work or do daily tasks.

**What is acupuncture?**
Acupuncture is a treatment where thin needles are placed into the skin at certain points on the body. It started in China many years ago. Today, doctors in many countries use it to help people with migraine.

**Why was this study needed?**
Researchers wanted to know if acupuncture can reduce how often migraine attacks happen. They wanted to see if acupuncture works better than regular care alone. They also wanted to compare acupuncture to fake acupuncture and to drugs that prevent migraines. This information helps patients and doctors decide if acupuncture is a good treatment choice.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**
This study looked at 22 different research trials. These trials included 4,985 people in total. The researchers reviewed studies published up to January 2016.

The trials tested acupuncture in three different ways:
- Some compared acupuncture plus usual care to usual care alone
- Some compared real acupuncture to fake acupuncture
- Some compared acupuncture to drugs that prevent migraines

**Who was in the studies?**
All people in the studies had migraine attacks. They had experienced migraines for at least 12 months.

**How long did the studies last?**
Most people received at least six acupuncture sessions. Researchers checked results at three months and six months after treatment started.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

**Acupuncture plus usual care versus usual care alone:**
When people got acupuncture along with their usual care, 41 out of 100 people had their headache days cut in half or more. When people got only usual care, just 17 out of 100 people had this improvement.

**Real acupuncture versus fake acupuncture:**
With real acupuncture, 50 out of 100 people had their headache days cut in half. With fake acupuncture, 41 out of 100 people had this improvement. Three large, high-quality studies showed that real acupuncture still worked after six months. Both real and fake acupuncture had about the same number of side effects.

**Acupuncture versus drugs:**
At three months, 57 out of 100 people using acupuncture had their headache days cut in half. For people taking drugs, 46 out of 100 had this improvement. At six months, 59 out of 100 people using acupuncture improved, compared to 54 out of 100 taking drugs. People getting acupuncture had fewer side effects. They were also less likely to stop treatment.

**What does this mean in everyday terms?**
Imagine someone has six days with migraine each month before treatment:
- With usual care only: they would have five migraine days per month
- With fake acupuncture or drugs: they would have four migraine days per month
- With real acupuncture: they would have three and a half migraine days per month

**What do the results mean?**
Acupuncture can help prevent migraine attacks. It works better than usual care alone. It works slightly better than fake acupuncture. It works about as well as drugs but causes fewer side effects. People need at least six acupuncture sessions to get good results.

**Quality of the research:**
The quality of the evidence was moderate. This means we can trust these results, but more research could make us more certain.

**Conclusion:**
Acupuncture is a good treatment option for people who want to prevent migraine attacks. It can reduce how often migraines happen with few side effects."
10.1002-14651858.CD001977.pub2-abstract.txt,"Acupuncture for osteoarthritis
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of acupuncture on osteoarthritis. 
The review shows that in people with osteoarthritis, 
‐Acupuncture may lead to small improvements in pain and physical function after 8 weeks. 
‐Acupuncture may lead to small improvements in pain and physical function after 26 weeks. 
We often do not have precise information about side effects and complications. This is particularly true for rare but serious side effects. Possible side effects of acupuncture treatment include minor bruising and bleeding at the site of needle insertion. 
What is osteoarthritis and what is acupuncture? 
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints, such as your knee or hip. When the joint loses cartilage, the bone grows to try and repair the damage. Instead of making things better, however, the bone grows abnormally and makes things worse. For example, the bone can become misshapen and make the joint painful and unstable. This can affect your physical function or ability to use your knee. 
According to the philosophy of traditional acupuncture, energy circulates in 'meridians' located throughout the body.  Pain or ill health happens when something occurs to cause this meridian energy circulation to be blocked. The way to restore health is to stimulate the appropriate combination of acupuncture points in the body by inserting very thin needles.  Sometimes in painful conditions, electrical stimulation along with the needles is also used.  According to acupuncture theory, one way you can tell that acupuncture is relieving pain is that you may feel numbness or tingling, called de qi, where the needle is inserted. 
Best estimate of what happens to people with osteoarthritis who have acupuncture: 
Pain after 8 weeks: 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by about 4 points on a scale of 0 to 20.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by about 3 points on a scale of 0 to 20. 
‐People who received acupuncture had a 1 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐20.  (5% absolute improvement). 
Pain after 26 weeks: 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by slightly more than 3 points on a scale of 0 to 20.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by slightly less than 3 points on a scale of 0 to 20. 
‐People who received acupuncture had under a 1 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐20.  (2% absolute improvement).  
Physical function after 8 weeks : 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 11 points on a scale of 0 to 68.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 8 points on a scale of 0 to 68. 
‐People who received acupuncture had about a 3 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐68.  (4% absolute improvement)  
Physical function after 26 weeks : 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 11 points on a scale of 0 to 68.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 10 points on a scale of 0 to 68. 
‐People who received acupuncture had about a 1 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐68.  (2% absolute improvement) 
","# Plain Language Summary: Acupuncture for Joint Pain from Osteoarthritis

## Plain Title
Does acupuncture help reduce pain and improve movement in people with osteoarthritis?

## Rationale

**What is osteoarthritis?**

Osteoarthritis is a disease that affects your joints. Joints are places where bones meet, like your knee or hip. Inside healthy joints, a smooth cushion called cartilage protects the bones. When you have osteoarthritis, this cushion wears away. Your body tries to fix the problem by growing new bone. But this new bone grows in the wrong way. It makes the joint painful and hard to move. This can make daily tasks difficult.

**What is acupuncture?**

Acupuncture is an old form of treatment. It comes from traditional Chinese medicine. Practitioners believe energy flows through paths in your body called meridians. When this energy gets blocked, you may feel pain or get sick. Acupuncture uses very thin needles. These needles are placed at special points on your body. The goal is to unblock the energy and reduce pain. Sometimes the needles also use small amounts of electricity. When acupuncture works, you may feel numbness or tingling where the needle goes in. This feeling is called de qi.

**Why was this study needed?**

Many people with osteoarthritis have constant pain. This pain makes it hard to walk, climb stairs, or do everyday activities. Researchers wanted to know if acupuncture could help these people. They reviewed many studies to see if acupuncture really works better than fake acupuncture treatment.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review of multiple research studies. Researchers looked at studies that compared real acupuncture to sham acupuncture. Sham acupuncture is a fake treatment that looks like real acupuncture but does not follow true acupuncture methods.

The studies included people with osteoarthritis in their joints. Researchers measured two main things: pain levels and physical function. Physical function means how well people could move and do daily tasks.

Researchers checked results at two time points. They looked at 8 weeks after treatment started. They also looked at 26 weeks after treatment started.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The review found that acupuncture may help a little bit. But the improvements were small.

**Pain results after 8 weeks:**
- People who got real acupuncture had pain improve by about 4 points.
- People who got fake acupuncture had pain improve by about 3 points.
- The scale went from 0 to 20 points.
- Real acupuncture helped 1 point more than fake acupuncture.

**Pain results after 26 weeks:**
- People who got real acupuncture had pain improve by slightly more than 3 points.
- People who got fake acupuncture had pain improve by slightly less than 3 points.
- Real acupuncture helped less than 1 point more than fake acupuncture.

**Movement results after 8 weeks:**
- People who got real acupuncture could move better by about 11 points.
- People who got fake acupuncture could move better by about 8 points.
- The scale went from 0 to 68 points.
- Real acupuncture helped about 3 points more than fake acupuncture.

**Movement results after 26 weeks:**
- People who got real acupuncture could move better by about 11 points.
- People who got fake acupuncture could move better by about 10 points.
- Real acupuncture helped about 1 point more than fake acupuncture.

**What do these results mean?**

Acupuncture may provide small improvements in pain and movement. These improvements are greater at 8 weeks than at 26 weeks. However, the benefits are quite small.

**Side effects:**

Acupuncture appears fairly safe. Some people may get small bruises where the needle goes in. Some people may have minor bleeding at these spots. Serious side effects are rare. But we do not have complete information about all possible side effects.

**Conclusions:**

Acupuncture may help people with osteoarthritis feel slightly less pain. It may also help them move a bit better. But the improvements are small. People considering acupuncture should talk with their doctor about whether it is right for them."
10.1002-14651858.CD002201.pub6-abstract.txt,"The use of omega‐3 supplements in people with cystic fibrosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of giving omega‐3 supplements to people with cystic fibrosis. 
Background 
In people with cystic fibrosis recurring cycles of infection and inflammation are thought to worsen lung function. Studies suggest that omega‐3 fatty acids, such as those derived from fish oils, may work to counter the inflammation and may be of benefit in chronic inflammatory diseases including cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of the review. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 01 April 2020.
Study characteristics 
This review includes five small studies which compare omega‐3 supplements to a different supplement without omega‐3. In total there were 106 participants, including both children and adults. The studies lasted between six weeks and 12 months. 
Key results 
Due to the very low‐quality evidence, we are uncertain whether the following effects are due to supplementation or not. One 12‐month study reported a reduction in pulmonary exacerbations and antibiotic use when taking omega‐3 supplementation compared to placebo and one three‐month study reported no change in antibiotic use during the study period. Few side effects were reported in any of the studies. One six‐week study reported that lung function and clinical status improved when taking omega‐3 supplements. Sputum levels were also noted to be reduced in this six‐week study. Three studies reported no difference in lung function when taking omega‐3 supplementation compared to placebo. Two longer studies found that people taking omega‐3 supplements showed definite increases in levels of essential fatty acids in their white blood cell membranes and also in levels of phospholipids (molecules that provide structure and protection to cells) measured in blood samples. 
We are uncertain whether regular omega‐3 supplements benefit people with cystic fibrosis and whether they cause side effects, or not. We are not able to draw firm conclusions or recommend the routine use of these supplements in people with cystic fibrosis. Larger and longer studies are needed to assess the clinical benefit of omega‐3 supplementation and to determine the appropriate dosage. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low due to very low participant numbers, low event rates, limited reporting and poor study design. There was no consistency with regards to the time points when results were reported or the measurements used for the same outcome in different studies. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Omega-3 Supplements for People with Cystic Fibrosis

## Plain Title
Do Omega-3 Supplements Help People with Cystic Fibrosis?

## Rationale

**What is cystic fibrosis?**
Cystic fibrosis is a long-term health condition. People with this condition get lung infections over and over again. These infections cause swelling in the lungs. This swelling is called inflammation. Over time, the infections and inflammation damage the lungs. This makes it harder to breathe.

**What are omega-3 supplements?**
Omega-3s are healthy fats found in fish oil. They come as pills or liquid supplements. Some studies show that omega-3s may reduce inflammation in the body.

**Why was this study needed?**
Researchers wanted to know if omega-3 supplements could help people with cystic fibrosis. Since omega-3s may reduce inflammation, they might protect the lungs. This could help people with cystic fibrosis feel better and have fewer lung problems.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was a review of research studies. The researchers looked at five small studies. These studies compared omega-3 supplements to other supplements without omega-3.

**Who was in the studies?**
A total of 106 people took part. This included both children and adults. All of them had cystic fibrosis.

**How long did the studies last?**
The studies lasted different amounts of time. The shortest study was 6 weeks long. The longest study was 12 months long.

**What did people take?**
Some people took omega-3 supplements. Other people took different supplements without omega-3. This helped researchers compare the two groups.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**
The results were mixed and unclear. The researchers could not be sure if omega-3 supplements really helped or not.

**Lung infections and antibiotics:**
One study that lasted 12 months found good results. People taking omega-3 had fewer lung infections. They also needed fewer antibiotics. However, another study found no change in antibiotic use.

**Lung function:**
One study that lasted 6 weeks found improvements. People taking omega-3 had better lung function. They also had less mucus in their lungs. But three other studies found no difference in lung function.

**Side effects:**
Very few side effects were reported. This means omega-3 supplements seemed safe to take.

**Blood tests:**
Two longer studies checked people's blood. They found that omega-3 supplements increased healthy fats in the blood. These fats are important for cells to work properly.

**What do these results mean?**
The researchers are not sure if omega-3 supplements help people with cystic fibrosis. The studies were too small. The results did not match each other. Some studies showed benefits, but others did not.

**What are the main conclusions?**
The researchers cannot recommend omega-3 supplements for all people with cystic fibrosis right now. More research is needed. Future studies should include more people. They should also last longer. This would help doctors know if omega-3 supplements really work.

**Why was the evidence weak?**
The quality of evidence was very low. Here are the reasons:
- The studies had very few people in them
- The studies measured things in different ways
- The studies did not report all their results clearly
- The study designs had problems

**What happens next?**
Larger and longer studies are needed. These studies should find out if omega-3 supplements truly help. They should also find out how much omega-3 people should take. Until then, people with cystic fibrosis should talk to their doctor before taking omega-3 supplements."
10.1002-14651858.CD002779.pub3-abstract.txt,"Interventions for treating burning mouth syndrome
Review question 
Which treatments help to relieve symptoms for people with burning mouth syndrome (BMS)?
Background 
BMS is a common painful condition. Symptoms include burning, dryness or uncomfortable sensations in the mouth and changes to taste, with no obvious underlying medical or dental cause. BMS is usually persistent and suffered long term, and can lead to a reduced quality of life (QoL). Currently, scientific research suggests that BMS is caused by underlying damage to the nerves. There are many treatments available including drugs for anxiety, other psychological conditions and increasing saliva production, protective barriers and treatments applied to the mouth surface amongst others. 
Study characteristics 
This review of studies was carried out through Cochrane Oral Health, and the evidence is current up to 31 December 2015. 
We found 23 studies (assessing 1121 people; 83% were women), published between 1995 and 2015 to include in this review. Twenty‐one studies assessed short‐term (up to three months) symptom relief, and four studies assessed long‐term (from three to six months) symptom relief. Seventeen studies provided information about side effect occurrence, seven studies assessed a measure of QoL, and two studies assessed changes in taste and feeling of dryness. 
All of the 23 treatments included in this review were compared to a placebo (fake treatment): antidepressants and antipsychotics (two studies), antiseizure drugs (one study), types of tranquillisers (four studies), saliva stimulants (one study), dietary supplements (12 studies), directed energy waves (one study), physical barriers (one study), psychological therapies (one study), and treatments applied to the mouth surface (five studies). 
Key results 
Short‐term symptom relief  
We found evidence of short‐term symptom relief for directed energy waves (one study, 58 participants), a type of tranquilliser used topically (that is held in the mouth before being removed, and which also acts as an antiseizure drug) called clonazepam (two studies, 111 participants), thin plastic tongue covers (one study, 50 participants), and an antiseizure drug called gabapentin (one study, 100 participants). 
There was no difference in short‐term symptom relief found for antidepressants, saliva stimulants, and another type of tranquilliser used systemically (one that is swallowed) also called clonazepam. We were unable to show whether dietary supplements or treatments applied to the mouth surface provide symptom relief in the short term or not. 
Short‐term relief was not reported for the single study that assessed a psychological therapy. 
Long‐term symptom relief  
We found evidence of long‐term symptom relief for psychological therapy (one study, 30 participants), chili pepper mouthrinse (one study, 18 participants) and the topical tranquilliser called clonazepam (one study, 66 participants). 
We found there was no difference in long‐term symptom relief for dietary supplements or treatments applied to the mouth surface. 
Studies which assessed antidepressants, directed energy waves, saliva stimulants, antiseizure drugs, or physical barriers did not evaluate long‐term symptom relief. 
Change in QoL  
There was evidence of short‐term improvement in QoL for directed energy waves (one study, 58 patients), although no difference was found for antidepressants, tranquillisers, dietary supplements and physical barriers. No study assessed long‐term QoL changes. 
Change in taste or feeling of dryness  
A few studies assessed short‐term change in taste or feeling of dryness (none evaluated these outcomes long‐term), but there was not enough evidence to judge the effects of treatment on these outcomes. 
Side effects  
Side effects were more likely to be experienced with antidepressants (dizziness and drowsiness more likely: one study, 37 people), and with a dietary supplement called alpha lipoic acid (also known as ALA) with or without other ingredients (headaches more likely: two studies, 118 people; and upset stomachs more likely: three studies, 138 people). 
Quality of the evidence  Overall, we found very low‐quality evidence for each short‐ and long‐term outcome we investigated (symptom relief; changes in QoL, taste and feeling of dryness; and side effects) in all types of assessed treatment: antidepressants and antipsychotics, antiseizure drugs, types of tranquillisers, saliva stimulants, dietary supplements, directed energy waves, physical barriers (except side effects, which was assessed as low quality), psychological therapies, and treatments applied to the mouth surface. As we found so few studies at low risk of bias, we are currently unable to prove or disprove the effectiveness of any treatments for managing BMS. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Treatments for Burning Mouth Syndrome

## Plain Title
Testing Different Treatments to Help People with Burning Mouth Syndrome

## Rationale

**What is burning mouth syndrome?**
Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a painful condition. People with BMS feel burning, dryness, or discomfort in their mouth. Their sense of taste may change. Doctors cannot find a clear medical or dental cause for these symptoms.

**Why is this condition a problem?**
BMS usually lasts a long time. It does not go away easily. The constant pain and discomfort can make life harder for patients. They may struggle to eat, drink, or enjoy daily activities.

**What causes BMS?**
Scientists believe BMS happens when nerves in the mouth become damaged. This nerve damage causes the burning feelings.

**Why was this study needed?**
Many different treatments exist for BMS. These include medicines for anxiety, medicines to help make more saliva, mouth rinses, and other options. However, doctors did not know which treatments work best. This study looked at the research to find out which treatments actually help people with BMS.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at 23 different studies. These studies tested treatments for BMS. The studies were published between 1995 and 2015.

**Who was in these studies?**
A total of 1,121 people took part. Most were women (83 out of every 100 people). All participants had burning mouth syndrome.

**What treatments were tested?**
Researchers tested 23 different treatments. All treatments were compared to fake treatments (called placebos). The treatments included:
- Medicines for depression and mental health
- Medicines to prevent seizures
- Calming medicines (tranquilizers)
- Products to make more saliva
- Vitamins and dietary supplements
- Directed energy waves (special light or energy therapy)
- Plastic covers for the tongue
- Talk therapy (psychological treatment)
- Mouth rinses and creams

**How long did the studies last?**
Most studies (21 studies) looked at short-term relief. Short-term means up to 3 months. Four studies looked at long-term relief. Long-term means 3 to 6 months.

**What did researchers measure?**
Researchers measured several things:
- Did symptoms get better?
- Did quality of life improve?
- Did taste or dryness change?
- Did treatments cause side effects?

## Results

**What were the main results?**

**Short-term relief (up to 3 months):**
Some treatments helped reduce symptoms:
- Directed energy waves (1 study, 58 people)
- Clonazepam held in the mouth (2 studies, 111 people). This is a calming medicine.
- Thin plastic tongue covers (1 study, 50 people)
- Gabapentin pills (1 study, 100 people). This is a seizure medicine.

Some treatments did not help:
- Depression medicines
- Products to make more saliva
- Clonazepam pills that are swallowed

For other treatments, researchers could not tell if they worked or not.

**Long-term relief (3 to 6 months):**
Some treatments helped reduce symptoms:
- Talk therapy (1 study, 30 people)
- Chili pepper mouth rinse (1 study, 18 people)
- Clonazepam held in the mouth (1 study, 66 people)

Vitamins and mouth treatments did not show long-term benefits.

**Quality of life:**
Directed energy waves improved quality of life in the short term (1 study, 58 people). Other treatments did not show clear improvements.

**Changes in taste or dryness:**
Not enough information was available to know if treatments helped with these problems.

**Side effects:**
Some treatments caused side effects:
- Depression medicines caused dizziness and drowsiness (1 study, 37 people)
- Alpha lipoic acid (a vitamin supplement) caused headaches (2 studies, 118 people) and upset stomachs (3 studies, 138 people)

**What do these results mean?**
The quality of evidence was very low. This means the studies had problems. The results may not be reliable. Researchers found only a few good-quality studies. 

**Conclusions:**
Right now, scientists cannot prove which treatments definitely work for BMS. More high-quality studies are needed. People with BMS should talk to their doctors about treatment options. What works may be different for each person."

This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effects of herbal therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
The review shows that in people with RA:
‐ Evening primrose oil, borage seed oil, or blackcurrent seed oil (containing gamma‐linolenic acid (GLA)) probably improve pain; may improve function; and probably does not increase adverse events (unwanted side effects). 
‐ Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F may improve some symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, and higher doses (180 mg ‐ 350 mg daily) may be more effective than lower doses (60 mg daily). There are some adverse events associated with Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F. 
‐ We are uncertain of the effects of other herbal therapies because only single studies were available, or important features of RA, such as changes in the number of swollen and tender joints, were not reported. 
Often we do not have precise information about side effects and complications, particularly for rare but serious side effects. Possible side effects associated with Triperygium wilfordii Hook F may include painful periods in women, decreased fertility in men, insufficient urine excretion, and increased rate of infections. Possible side effects associated with GLA sourced from evening primrose oil include headache, nausea, and diarrhoea, and rare complications include allergy and seizures. 
What is rheumatoid arthritis and what is herbal therapy? 
When you have RA, your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the lining of your joints. This makes your joints swollen, stiff and painful. The small joints of your hands and feet are usually affected first. There is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis at present, so treatments are used to relieve pain and stiffness and improve your ability to move. 
Herbal interventions are defined as any plant preparation (whole, powder, extract, standardised mixture) used for medicinal purposes. Historically, many herbal therapies have been used to treat RA. Like conventional non‐herbal drugs, many herbal therapies are believed to act by blocking the activity of these immune cells and substances and reducing inflammation in the joints, and some people believe they have fewer side effects.  
Best estimate of what happens to people with rheumatoid arthritis:  
Pain (higher scores mean worse or more severe pain):
‐People who took eveing primrose oil, primrose oil, borage seed oil, or blackcurrent seed oil (wih the active ingredient GLA) rated their pain to be 33 points lower (9 to 56 points lower) on a scale of 0 to 100 after 6 months of treatment (33% absolute improvement). 
‐People who took placebo rated their pain to be 19 points lower after treatment.
Physical function (higher score means greater disability):
‐People who took GLA rated their disability 16% better.
‐People who placebo rated their disability 5% better.

## Plain Title
Testing Plant-Based Treatments for Rheumatoid Arthritis Pain and Joint Problems

## Rationale

**What is rheumatoid arthritis?**

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a disease that affects your joints. Your body's defense system, which normally fights germs, attacks your joints by mistake. This makes joints swell, hurt, and become stiff. The small joints in your hands and feet usually get affected first.

**Why is this a problem for patients?**

People with RA have pain every day. They have trouble moving and doing normal tasks. Right now, there is no cure for RA. Treatments can only help reduce pain and stiffness.

**Why was this study needed?**

For many years, people have used plants and herbs to treat RA. Some people think herbal treatments might work as well as regular drugs. They also believe herbs might cause fewer side effects. This study looked at research to see if herbal treatments really help people with RA.

**How might herbal treatments work?**

Like regular drugs, herbal treatments may block the body's defense system from attacking the joints. This could reduce swelling and pain in the joints.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at many other studies about herbal treatments for RA. They gathered all the information together to see what works.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included adults with rheumatoid arthritis. Both men and women took part.

**What treatments were tested?**

Researchers looked at many different plant-based treatments. The main ones were:
- Oils from evening primrose, borage seeds, or blackcurrant seeds (these contain a substance called GLA)
- A Chinese herb called Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F
- Other herbal treatments

**How long did the studies last?**

Most studies lasted about 6 months.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

**For oils containing GLA (evening primrose oil, borage seed oil, blackcurrant seed oil):**

People rated their pain on a scale from 0 to 100. Lower numbers mean less pain.
- People who took GLA oils had pain scores that were 33 points lower after 6 months
- People who took fake pills (placebo) had pain scores that were 19 points lower

This means GLA oils helped reduce pain more than placebo.

People also rated how well they could do daily tasks.
- People who took GLA oils could do tasks 16% better
- People who took placebo could do tasks 5% better

Side effects from GLA oils were rare. Some people had headaches, upset stomach, or loose stools. Very rarely, people had allergic reactions or seizures.

**For Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F:**

This Chinese herb may help some RA symptoms. Higher doses (180 mg to 350 mg per day) worked better than lower doses (60 mg per day).

However, this herb caused more side effects:
- Women may have painful periods
- Men may have trouble having children
- Some people had kidney problems
- Some people got more infections

**For other herbal treatments:**

Researchers could not tell if other herbs worked. There were not enough studies. Many studies did not measure important things like joint swelling.

**What do these results mean?**

GLA oils from evening primrose, borage seeds, or blackcurrant seeds probably help reduce pain in people with RA. They may help people do daily tasks better. They seem safe for most people.

The Chinese herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F may help some symptoms. But it can cause serious side effects.

More research is needed on other herbal treatments before we know if they work.

10.1002-14651858.CD003147.pub5-abstract.txt,"Using positive expiratory pressure physiotherapy to clear the airways of people with cystic fibrosis 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effect of positive expiratory pressure (PEP) physiotherapy to clear the airways of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). 
Background 
CF affects approximately one in 3000 live births in white populations and causes frequent lung infection, due to mucus blocking the airways. Chest physiotherapy is often used to try to clear the mucus from the lungs. We wanted to discover whether using a PEP device (a form of chest physiotherapy) was better or worse than other other forms of chest physiotherapy for clearing the mucus from the lungs in people with CF. A PEP device provides positive pressure behind the mucus to try to push it out of the lungs. This is an update of a previously published review. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to 20 February 2019.
Study characteristics 
The review includes 28 studies with 788 people (from infants to adults) with CF with mild to severe lung disease. The studies compared PEP to other methods of chest physiotherapy; the length of treatment ranged from a single session to two years of treatment. 
Key results 
Generally, the efficacy of PEP is similar to other methods of chest physiotherapy such as postural drainage with percussion, active cycle of breathing techniques, autogenic drainage, oscillatory PEP devices such as the flutter and acapella, thoracic oscillating devices such as the 'Vest', and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPaP) (typically used for ventilatory support, but by changing the inspiratory and expiratory pressures on the device and combining it with huffing, BiPaP has been used for airway clearance). We found no difference between PEP and other forms of chest physiotherapy in lung function, the amount of mucus cleared from the airways or its related effects on the health of people with CF. However, the rate of flare ups of respiratory symptoms decreased in people using PEP compared to other forms of physiotherapy such as a vibrating PEP device or a vibrating vest. There was some evidence that people with CF may prefer PEP to other chest physiotherapy methods. There was no evidence of PEP causing harm, except in one study where infants performing either PEP or percussion in various positions which use gravity to help drain secretions, experienced some gastro‐oesophageal reflux (regurgitation of food) in head‐down positions; this was more severe in the group using postural drainage with percussion. In all the other trials PEP was performed in a sitting position. 
In 10 of the 28 studies studied single PEP treatment sessions. The results from these studies are very limited as they could not report on the number of respiratory infections and lung function did not change with just one treatment. Two one‐year studies compared PEP to postural drainage and percussion; in the study with children, PEP improved their lung function, while in the adult study, lung function declined slightly with both PEP and postural drainage and percussion. Also, the method of performing PEP was different in the two age groups. 
Although PEP seems to have an advantage in reducing flare ups (based on the combined results of a few studies), different physiotherapy techniques and devices may be more or less effective at varying times and in different individuals during baseline function and chest flare ups. Each person should talk to their clinician to help choose which method of airway clearance is best for them and which they will adhere to, so as to provide the best quality of life and long‐term outcomes. 
Quality of the evidence 
Some studies were of low quality. These studies highlight the difficulty in comparing studies using PEP compared to other forms of chest physiotherapy. Factors such as age and severity of lung disease in the participants may affect the results as well as the method of performing each treatment. Overall, the evidence provided by this review for whether PEP reduces flare ups compared to other forms of chest physiotherapy was moderate to high quality, but evidence for other outcomes was of very low to moderate quality, as results were limited. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Using a Breathing Device Called PEP to Help Clear Mucus from the Lungs in People with Cystic Fibrosis

## Rationale

**What is cystic fibrosis and why is it a problem?**

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease that affects about 1 in 3,000 babies born in white populations. People with CF have thick, sticky mucus that blocks their airways. This mucus traps germs and causes frequent lung infections. Over time, these infections can damage the lungs and make it hard to breathe.

**Why was this study needed?**

People with CF need to clear mucus from their lungs every day. Chest physiotherapy helps push the mucus out. There are many different ways to do chest physiotherapy. Doctors and patients need to know which methods work best.

**What is PEP and how might it help?**

PEP stands for positive expiratory pressure. A PEP device is a small tool that people breathe out through. It creates gentle pressure behind the mucus. This pressure helps push the mucus out of the lungs. Researchers wanted to see if PEP works better than other chest physiotherapy methods.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at 28 different studies that had already been done. They combined the results to see the bigger picture.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included 788 people with CF. These people ranged from babies to adults. Some had mild lung disease. Others had severe lung disease. Both males and females were included.

**What did the studies compare?**

The studies compared PEP to other chest physiotherapy methods. These other methods included:
- Postural drainage with percussion (lying in different positions while someone claps on the chest)
- Active cycle of breathing techniques (special breathing patterns)
- Autogenic drainage (another breathing technique)
- Flutter and acapella devices (vibrating tools)
- Vibrating vests
- BiPAP machines (breathing support machines used in a special way)

**How long did the studies last?**

Some studies tested just one treatment session. Other studies lasted up to two years. Most people in the studies did their treatments while sitting up.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

PEP worked about as well as other chest physiotherapy methods. Researchers found no big differences in:
- How well the lungs worked
- How much mucus came out
- Overall health of people with CF

However, PEP did have one important benefit. People using PEP had fewer flare-ups of breathing problems. Flare-ups are times when symptoms get worse. This benefit was seen when comparing PEP to vibrating devices and vibrating vests.

**Did people prefer PEP?**

Some evidence showed that people with CF may like using PEP more than other methods.

**Was PEP safe?**

PEP was safe in almost all studies. In one study with babies, some babies had food come back up (reflux). This happened more with postural drainage than with PEP. This only happened when babies were in head-down positions. All other studies had people sit up during treatment.

**What about long-term studies?**

Two studies lasted one year. One study was with children. Their lung function got better with PEP. One study was with adults. Their lung function got slightly worse with both PEP and postural drainage. The way people did PEP was different in these two studies.

**What do these results mean?**

Different methods may work better for different people. What works best may change over time. It may also depend on whether someone is feeling well or having a flare-up.

**What should people with CF do?**

Each person with CF should talk with their doctor or physiotherapist. Together, they can choose the best airway clearance method. The best method is one that:
- Works well for that person
- They will use every day
- Gives them the best quality of life

**Quality of the evidence:**

Some studies were better quality than others. The evidence about PEP reducing flare-ups was moderate to high quality. Evidence about other outcomes was lower quality because results were limited."
10.1002-14651858.CD003315.pub3-abstract.txt,"Feeding interventions for growth and development in infants with cleft lip, cleft palate or cleft lip and palate 
Cleft lip and cleft palate (the roof of the mouth) are common defects. The severity of the cleft (opening) varies and it can occur on one (unilateral) or both sides (bilateral). It can be difficult to feed babies enough nutritious food when they have this condition, and there is evidence of delayed development in children born with cleft. 
This review aimed to compare the effects of different feeding interventions such as maternal advice and support, modified bottles and/or teats, obturating or maxillary plates (plates placed in the roof of the mouth to artificially close the cleft palate) and supplemental breastfeeding in babies with cleft lip and/or palate prior to, or following, closure. Interventions in the first 6 months from term and used with breast milk or formula feeding only were considered, but outcomes (measures of growth, development and parental satisfaction) may have been measured at any time including adulthood. 
Maternal advice and support on feeding techniques and breastfeeding positions are often provided, but no studies evaluated the effectiveness of this intervention. Squeezable rather than rigid bottles may be easier to use for feeding babies with cleft lip and/or palate, and breastfeeding may have growth advantages over spoon‐feeding following cleft lip surgery. Only five studies (including 292 babies) compared the effects of feeding interventions in babies with cleft lip and/or palate on growth, development or parental satisfaction. Evidence for breastfeeding rather than spoon‐feeding following surgery was weak and there was a suggestion that squeezable bottles may be more manageable than rigid ones. No evidence was found to support the use of maxillary plates in babies with unilateral clefts and no studies assessed the effects of maternal advice or support. Further research is required to assess the most effective feeding interventions to prevent developmental delays in infants with cleft lip and/or palate. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
How to Best Feed Babies Born with Cleft Lip or Cleft Palate

## Rationale

Some babies are born with a cleft lip or cleft palate. This means there is an opening in the lip or the roof of the mouth. The opening can be small or large. It can be on one side or both sides of the face.

These openings make it hard for babies to eat. Babies with clefts may not get enough food. When babies do not eat enough, they may not grow well. Research shows that children born with clefts may have delays in how they grow and develop.

Doctors and nurses want to find the best ways to feed these babies. Good feeding helps babies grow strong and healthy. This study looked at different feeding methods. The goal was to find out which methods work best for babies with cleft lip or cleft palate.

## Trial Design

The researchers looked at many studies about feeding babies with clefts. They wanted to compare different feeding methods. These methods included:
- Teaching and helping mothers about feeding
- Special bottles that can be squeezed
- Regular bottles that are hard
- Special plates placed in the mouth to cover the opening
- Breastfeeding with extra help

The researchers only looked at feeding methods used in the first 6 months of life. They looked at babies who drank breast milk or formula. The babies could be any age when researchers checked how well they were doing. Some studies even checked on people when they were adults.

The researchers wanted to know three main things:
- Did the babies grow well?
- Did the babies develop normally?
- Were the parents happy with the feeding method?

Only five studies met the rules for this review. These five studies included 292 babies total. All babies had cleft lip or cleft palate or both.

## Results

The researchers found very few studies to review. This means there is not much proof about which feeding methods work best.

Here is what they found:

Many mothers get advice about how to feed their babies. Nurses teach them special ways to hold the baby. They show them different breastfeeding positions. But no studies tested if this advice really helps. We do not know if teaching mothers makes a difference.

Squeezable bottles may be easier to use than hard bottles. Parents may find them more helpful when feeding babies with clefts.

After surgery to fix a cleft lip, breastfeeding may help babies grow better than spoon-feeding. But the proof for this is weak. More research is needed.

Some doctors use special plates in the baby's mouth. These plates cover the opening in the roof of the mouth. But the researchers found no proof that these plates help babies with clefts on one side.

The main finding is that we need more research. We do not have enough information to say which feeding method is best. Doctors and parents need better guidance.

The researchers concluded that more studies are needed. These studies should test different feeding methods. They should measure if babies grow well. They should check if babies develop on time. They should ask parents which methods are easiest to use.

Better feeding methods could help prevent delays in growth and development. This would help babies with cleft lip or cleft palate live healthier lives."
10.1002-14651858.CD003459.pub4-abstract.txt,"Methotrexate for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease
Although corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission of Crohn's disease, many patients relapse when steroids are withdrawn or become steroid dependent. Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant side effects. Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug that is used to treat active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. This review includes seven randomized trials with a total of 495 participants. There is evidence from one large study which suggests that methotrexate (25 mg/week) injected intramuscularly for 16 weeks among patients with active treatment resistant Crohn's disease may provide a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids. This reduction in steroid use could reduce steroid‐induced side effects for people with chronic Crohn's disease. Although side effects are more common with high dose methotrexate therapy, no serious side effects have been observed. Common side effects associated with methotrexate therapy include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash and headache. Studies comparing lower dose oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) to placebo (e.g. sugar pill) or other active drugs (e.g. azathioprine or 6‐mercaptopurine) indicate that lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any benefit for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. However, these trials were small in size and further studies of oral methotrexate may be justified. Two studies looked at the combination of methotrexate and infliximab (a biological drug) compared to infliximab therapy alone. These studies indicated that the addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infiximab. However these studies were relatively small and further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Methotrexate for Treatment of Active Treatment Resistant Crohn's Disease

## Plain Title
Does methotrexate help people with Crohn's disease that has not responded to other treatments?

## Rationale

**What is Crohn's disease?**
Crohn's disease is a long-term illness. It causes swelling in the gut. This can lead to belly pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. People with Crohn's disease often feel very tired. The disease can make daily life hard.

**Current treatments and their problems**
Doctors often use steroid drugs to treat Crohn's disease. Steroids can help at first. But many patients get sick again when they stop taking steroids. Some patients need to take steroids all the time. This is called steroid dependent. Steroids can cause bad side effects when used for a long time.

**Why study methotrexate?**
Methotrexate is a drug that calms down the body's immune system. Doctors wanted to know if methotrexate could help people with Crohn's disease. They wanted to see if it could help patients stop taking steroids. This would reduce the bad side effects from steroids. The study looked at patients whose Crohn's disease did not get better with other treatments.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at seven different studies. These studies included 495 people in total. The studies were randomized trials. This means patients were put into groups by chance. Some patients got methotrexate. Other patients got a fake pill or a different drug.

**Who was in the studies?**
The studies included adults with active Crohn's disease. These patients had not gotten better with other treatments. Their disease was hard to control.

**What did the studies test?**
Some studies tested methotrexate shots given into the muscle. The dose was 25 mg each week. Other studies tested lower doses of methotrexate pills. The dose was 12.5 to 15 mg each week. Some studies tested methotrexate plus another drug called infliximab.

**How long did the studies last?**
The main study lasted 16 weeks. Different studies had different lengths.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

**High dose methotrexate shots work**
One large study showed good results. Patients got 25 mg of methotrexate as a shot each week. They took it for 16 weeks. These patients did better than those who got fake shots. More patients went into remission. Remission means their symptoms got much better or went away. More patients were able to stop taking steroids completely.

**Benefits for patients**
Being able to stop steroids is important. It means fewer side effects from steroids. Patients may feel better overall. Their quality of life may improve.

**Low dose methotrexate pills did not work as well**
Studies tested lower doses taken as pills. These doses were 12.5 to 15 mg each week. These studies did not show clear benefits. However, these studies were small. More research may be needed.

**Methotrexate plus infliximab**
Two studies looked at using methotrexate with infliximab. Infliximab is a biological drug. Adding methotrexate did not seem to help more than infliximab alone. But these studies were small. More research is needed.

**Side effects**
Methotrexate can cause side effects. Common side effects include feeling sick to your stomach, throwing up, belly pain, diarrhea, skin rash, and headache. No serious side effects were seen in these studies. High doses caused more side effects than low doses.

**What do these results mean?**
High dose methotrexate shots may help people with hard-to-treat Crohn's disease. It may help them get into remission. It may help them stop taking steroids. This could reduce steroid side effects. Lower dose pills need more study. The role of methotrexate with biological drugs needs more research.

**Conclusions**
Methotrexate shots at 25 mg per week may be a good treatment option. It works for patients whose Crohn's disease has not responded to other treatments. It can help reduce the need for steroids."
10.1002-14651858.CD003552.pub4-abstract.txt,"Skin patch or vaginal ring compared to pills for birth control
The skin patch and the vaginal (birth canal) ring are two methods of birth control. Both methods contain the hormones estrogen and progestin. The patch is a small, thin, adhesive square that is applied to the skin. The contraceptive vaginal ring is a flexible, lightweight device that is inserted into the vagina. Both methods release drugs like those in birth control pills. These methods could be used more consistently than pills because they do not require a daily dose. This review looked at how well the methods worked to prevent pregnancy, if they caused bleeding problems, if women used them as prescribed, and how safe they were. 
Through February 2013, we did computer searches for randomized controlled trials of the skin patch or vaginal ring compared to pills for birth control. Pills included types with both estrogen and progestin. We wrote to researchers to find other trials. 
We found 18 trials. Of six patch trials, five compared the marketed patch to birth control pills and one studied a patch being developed. Of 12 ring trials, 11 looked at the marketed ring and pills while one studied a ring being developed. The methods compared had similar pregnancy rates. Patch users reported using their method more consistently than the pill group did. Only half of the patch studies had data on pregnancy or whether the women used the method correctly. However, most of the ring studies had those data. 
Patch users were more likely than pill users to drop out early from the trial. Ring users were not more likely to drop out early. Compared to pill users, users of the marketed patch had more breast discomfort, painful periods, nausea, and vomiting. Ring users had more vaginal irritation and discharge than pill users but less nausea, acne, irritability, depression, and emotional changes. Ring users often had fewer bleeding problems than pill users. 
The quality of information was classed as low for the patch trials and moderate for the ring studies. Lower quality was due to not reporting how groups were assigned or not having good outcome measures. Other issues were high losses and taking assigned women out of the analysis. Studies of the patch and ring should provide more detail on whether women used the method correctly.

## Plain Title
Comparing Birth Control Methods: Skin Patch and Vaginal Ring Versus Daily Pills

## Rationale

**What is birth control and why is it important?**

Birth control helps women prevent pregnancy when they do not want to become pregnant. Many women use birth control pills, which must be taken every day. Missing pills can make them less effective.

**What other birth control options exist?**

Two other options are the skin patch and the vaginal ring. The skin patch is a small, thin sticker placed on the skin. The vaginal ring is a soft, light device placed inside the birth canal. Both release hormones similar to birth control pills. These hormones are called estrogen and progestin.

**Why was this study needed?**

Taking a pill every day can be hard to remember. The patch and ring might be easier to use correctly because they do not need daily attention. The patch is changed once a week. The ring is changed once a month. Researchers wanted to know if these methods work as well as pills. They also wanted to know if women would use them correctly and if they were safe.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 18 different studies. These studies compared the patch or ring to birth control pills. Six studies tested the skin patch. Twelve studies tested the vaginal ring. Most studies used products already sold in stores. Two studies tested products still being developed.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included women who needed birth control. The studies did not provide specific details about age ranges in this summary.

**How long did the studies last?**

The summary does not state exactly how long women stayed in each study.

**How did researchers find these studies?**

They searched computers for studies published through February 2013. They also contacted researchers directly to find more studies.

## Results

**What did the researchers find about preventing pregnancy?**

All three methods worked about the same to prevent pregnancy. The patch, ring, and pills had similar pregnancy rates.

**Did women use the methods correctly?**

Women using the patch said they used their method more often as directed than women using pills. However, only half of the patch studies tracked this information. Most ring studies did track whether women used the method correctly.

**Did women stop using the methods early?**

Women using the patch were more likely to quit the study early than women using pills. Women using the ring were not more likely to quit early.

**What side effects did women experience?**

Women using the patch had more of these problems than pill users:
- Breast pain or discomfort
- Painful periods
- Nausea (feeling sick to the stomach)
- Vomiting (throwing up)

Women using the ring had more of these problems than pill users:
- Vaginal irritation (soreness in the birth canal)
- Vaginal discharge (fluid from the birth canal)

Women using the ring had fewer of these problems than pill users:
- Nausea
- Acne (skin breakouts)
- Feeling irritable or moody
- Depression (feeling very sad)
- Emotional changes

Ring users also had fewer bleeding problems than pill users.

**How good was the information?**

The quality of the patch studies was rated as low. The quality of the ring studies was rated as moderate. Some studies did not clearly explain how they assigned women to groups. Some studies lost track of many women. Some studies did not measure outcomes well.

**What do researchers recommend?**

Future studies should provide better information about whether women use these methods correctly. This would help doctors and patients make better choices about birth control."
10.1002-14651858.CD003737.pub4-abstract.txt,"What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for intermittent exotropia (an eye co‐ordination problem that starts in childhood)? 
Key messages 
· Covering one eye with a patch improves the eye co‐ordination of children with intermittent exotropia more effectively than regular monitoring by an eye specialist. 
· Few studies have compared other treatments for intermittent exotropia, and those that have do not provide clear answers about their benefits and risks. 
· Well‐conducted studies are needed in this area to improve the management of intermittent exotropia. 
What is intermittent exotropia? 
Intermittent exotropia is an eye condition that develops in the first year of life. It causes one or both eyes to turn out toward the ear, typically when a child looks into the distance, daydreams, is tired, or is in bright sunlight. Only one eye turns out at a time, while the other eye points straight forwards. This can happen infrequently, or regularly throughout the day. 
What treatments are available for intermittent exotropia? 
Regular monitoring (observation) by an eye specialist may be all that is needed when a child’s eyes point in the same direction most of the time, or when intermittent exotropia does not affect vision. 
For children with more severe intermittent exotropia, several treatments are available, including: 
· eye exercises, to improve a child’s control over their eye movements;
· glasses, to encourage the eyes to work together;
· eye muscle surgery, to adjust the position of the eyes; and
· covering one eye with a patch, to strengthen the other eye.
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out:
· which treatment works best for intermittent exotropia; and
· whether treatments cause any unwanted (adverse) effects.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared different treatments for intermittent exotropia against each other. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found 6 studies that involved a total of 890 people who were mostly children aged 12 months to 10 years. The studies followed people for between six months and three years, and took place in the USA (four studies), India (one study), and Turkey (one study). The studies compared: 
· patching against observation (two studies); and
· different treatments involving surgery (four studies).
Patching compared to observation 
The evidence:
· shows that patching is better than observation for improving eye co‐ordination; and 
· suggests that patching and observation may have similar effects on sharpness of near vision. 
Different surgical procedures 
The evidence suggests that:
· surgery on the muscles that control the outward movement of both eyes is probably better for improving eye co‐ordination than surgery on the muscles that control both inward and outward movement in one eye; 
· these two procedures may have similar effects on sharpness of near vision and quality of life, and may lead to similar numbers of adverse effects (such as small lumps under the skin); and 
· there may be little to no difference in effect on eye co‐ordination when looking at distant objects between surgical procedures on the inside of the eye (‘plication’ and ‘resection’) when combined with surgery on the outside of the eye. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
The evidence is based on a small number of studies, and several studies may have used methods likely to introduce errors in their results. In general, the studies provided limited information about the benefits and risks of different treatments for intermittent exotropia. For example, they often did not investigate adverse effects or effects on sharpness of vision at a distance and quality of life. 
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
The evidence is current to January 2021.

## Plain Title
Comparing Treatments for Children Whose Eyes Turn Outward (Intermittent Exotropia)

## Rationale

### What is the condition?
Some children develop a problem where one eye turns outward toward the ear. This is called intermittent exotropia. It usually starts in the first year of life.

The eye turning happens from time to time, not all the time. It often occurs when a child looks far away, feels tired, daydreams, or is in bright sunlight. Only one eye turns out at a time. The other eye points straight ahead.

This condition can affect how well the eyes work together. It may bother children and their families. Some children need treatment to help their eyes work better together.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors have several ways to treat this eye problem. They needed to know which treatments work best. They also needed to know if treatments cause any problems or side effects.

Different treatments include watching and waiting, using an eye patch, doing eye exercises, wearing glasses, or having eye surgery. Researchers wanted to compare these treatments to help doctors choose the best option for each child.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked for studies that compared different treatments for intermittent exotropia. They found 6 studies with 890 people total. Most people in the studies were children.

The children were between 12 months and 10 years old. The studies followed them for 6 months to 3 years. Four studies took place in the USA. One study was in India. One study was in Turkey.

The studies compared:
- Using an eye patch versus just watching and waiting (2 studies)
- Different types of eye surgery (4 studies)

Researchers looked at how well each treatment helped the eyes work together. They also looked for any problems the treatments caused.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

**Eye Patch Compared to Watching and Waiting**

Two studies looked at using an eye patch. The patch covers one eye. This makes the other eye work harder and get stronger.

The results showed that using an eye patch works better than just watching and waiting. Children who wore patches had better eye coordination. Their eyes worked together better.

Both treatments seemed to work about the same for near vision sharpness. Near vision means seeing things up close.

**Different Types of Eye Surgery**

Four studies looked at different surgery options. Eye surgery adjusts the muscles that move the eyes.

One type of surgery works on both eyes. It adjusts the muscles that move the eyes outward. Another type works on just one eye. It adjusts muscles that move the eye both inward and outward.

Surgery on both eyes probably works better than surgery on one eye. It helps the eyes work together better.

Both types of surgery seem to work about the same for near vision and quality of life. Quality of life means how the condition affects daily activities and feelings. Both surgeries caused about the same number of side effects. Side effects included small lumps under the skin.

Other studies compared different surgery methods on the inside and outside of the eye. These methods worked about the same for helping eyes work together when looking at distant objects.

### What does this mean?
The evidence shows that eye patches help children with intermittent exotropia more than just watching and waiting. For surgery, working on both eyes may work better than working on one eye.

However, researchers need more studies. The current studies were small. Some studies may have had errors in how they were done. Many studies did not look at important things like side effects, distance vision, or quality of life.

Better studies are needed to help doctors know the best way to treat children with this eye condition.

10.1002-14651858.CD004019.pub4-abstract.txt,"Osteotomy for treating knee osteoarthritis
Researchers from The Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review of the effects of an osteotomy in people with osteoarthritis of the knee. Upon searching for all relevant studies until November 2013, they found 21 studies that included up to 1065 people. Their findings are summarised below. 
This review shows that in people with osteoarthritis of the knee:
• osteotomy can improve pain and function, but this is based on changes within a treatment group. No studies compared osteotomy versus conservative treatment; and • no evidence can be found for a preferred osteotomy technique. 
What is osteoarthritis of the knee, and what is an osteotomy?  Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints, such as the knee or the hip. When the joint loses cartilage, the bone grows to try to repair the damage. Instead of making things better, however, the bone grows abnormally and makes things worse. For example, the bone can become misshapen, and this can make the joint painful and unstable. This can affect physical function or ability to use the knee. Two main types of surgery are used to treat patients with osteoarthritis of the knee: knee replacement and osteotomy. 
Osteotomy is surgery in which the bones are cut and realigned. Osteotomy around the knee changes the alignment of the knee. Weight bearing will be shifted from the diseased part to a healthy part of the knee. By 'unloading' the damaged cartilage of the knee, osteotomy may decrease pain, improve function, slow knee deterioration and possibly delay the need for (partial or) total knee replacement surgery. 
What happens to people after an osteotomy for knee osteoarthritis?  Follow‐up of all studies was too short to allow scoring of treatment failure; this refers to a revision to a knee replacement. 
In all studies, people reported less pain and improved knee function and quality of life after any type of high tibial osteotomy. However this comparison is based on differences before and after an osteotomy, not on comparison with non‐operative treatment. Probably no differences in pain and function scores are noted between different osteotomy techniques. 
Rare complications may include thromboembolism and lesions to nerves and vascular structures. 
The most important reasons for reoperation include hardware removal resulting from pain and pin track infection due to the external fixator. This reoperation rate may be higher in patients undergoing another high tibial osteotomy technique compared with those treated with the closing wedge technique. 
Two studies compared high tibial osteotomy versus partial knee replacement. Benefits did not differ between these types of surgery. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Surgery to Realign the Knee Bone in People with Knee Arthritis

## Plain Title
Does surgery to cut and realign knee bones help people with knee arthritis?

## Rationale

**What is knee arthritis?**
Knee arthritis is a disease that affects the knee joint. The joint loses its cushion (called cartilage). When this happens, the bone tries to fix itself. But instead of helping, the bone grows in the wrong way. This makes the knee painful and unstable. People may have trouble walking or using their knee.

**What is osteotomy surgery?**
Osteotomy is a type of surgery. Doctors cut the bone and move it to a better position. This changes how the knee lines up. The goal is to shift weight from the damaged part of the knee to a healthy part. This ""unloading"" may reduce pain and help the knee work better. It may also slow down more damage. It might delay the need for a full knee replacement.

**Why was this study needed?**
Researchers wanted to know if osteotomy surgery helps people with knee arthritis. They looked at all the studies done on this topic. They wanted to find out if this surgery reduces pain and improves how well the knee works. They also wanted to know which type of osteotomy works best.

## Trial Design

**How was this review designed?**
Researchers searched for all studies about osteotomy for knee arthritis. They looked for studies published until November 2013. They found 21 studies. These studies included up to 1065 people total.

**Who was in these studies?**
The studies included people with knee arthritis. These people had osteotomy surgery on their knee.

**What did researchers look at?**
Researchers looked at pain levels and knee function after surgery. They compared different types of osteotomy surgery. They also looked at problems that happened after surgery.

## Results

**What did the studies show about pain and function?**
People reported less pain after osteotomy surgery. Their knees worked better. Their quality of life improved. However, these studies only looked at changes before and after surgery. No studies compared osteotomy to non-surgical treatment. This means we cannot say if surgery works better than other treatments like physical therapy or medicine.

**Which type of osteotomy works best?**
The studies found no clear winner. Different types of osteotomy seemed to work about the same. No evidence showed that one technique was better than another.

**What about osteotomy versus partial knee replacement?**
Two studies compared osteotomy to partial knee replacement. Both types of surgery helped about the same amount. Neither one was clearly better.

**What problems can happen after surgery?**
Most people did well after surgery. But some problems can happen. Rare problems include blood clots and damage to nerves or blood vessels.

Some people needed a second surgery. The most common reasons were:
• Removing metal hardware that caused pain
• Treating infections from pins used during surgery

People who had certain types of osteotomy may need more second surgeries than others.

**What could researchers not measure?**
The studies did not follow people long enough. Researchers could not tell how many people later needed a full knee replacement. This is important information that is still missing.

**What do these results mean?**
Osteotomy surgery may help reduce pain and improve knee function in people with knee arthritis. However, we do not know if it works better than non-surgical treatments. We also do not know which type of osteotomy is best. More research is needed to answer these questions.

People thinking about this surgery should talk with their doctor. They should discuss the possible benefits and risks. They should also discuss other treatment options.

10.1002-14651858.CD004314.pub3-abstract.txt,"A comparison of botulinum toxin type A versus botulinum toxin type B for involuntary positioning of the head, or cervical dystonia 
The review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of botulinum toxin type A (BtA) compared to botulinum toxin type B (BtB) in people with involuntary positioning of the head, or cervical dystonia. This is an update of a previous Cochrane Review and we assessed the effectiveness (reduction in severity, disability and pain) and safety of BtA versus BtB in cervical dystonia. 
Background 
Cervical dystonia, also called spasmodic torticollis, is a disease that causes undesired, uncontrollable, often painful, abnormal placement of the head. It is a relatively uncommon condition (affecting 57 to 280 people per million) that can be very disabling and can affect a person's quality of life negatively. In most cases the cause is unknown and no cure exists. Since cervical dystonia is normally a long‐term disease it requires long‐term treatment. 
Botulinum toxin (Bt) is a powerful, natural chemical that can cause severe paralysis (an inability to move in the part of the body where it is applied) in animals and humans. It can also be used to treat many conditions, in particular those with involuntary muscle contractions, such as cervical dystonia. Bt is delivered by injections into the muscles that contract to produce the disease. There are different types of Bt, not all are available for treating health conditions. BtA is typically the first‐used treatment in cervical dystonia, but botulinum toxin type B (BtB) is an alternative option. The relative strength of each Bt formulation is variable, and the cost for 200 units varies from GBP 198 to GBP 308. 
Study characteristics 
We performed a rigorous search of the medical literature in October 2016 and found three studies that compared a single treatment session of BtA with BtB. These studies included a total of 270 participants, with on average a moderate disease impairment. The participants remained in the studies for a short period of time ‐ between 16 and 20 weeks after the treatment. The average age of people in the studies was 53.3 years, and they had had cervical dystonia for an average of 6.6 to 7.9 years before taking part in the trials. Most, 63.3%, of the people in the studies were women. All three of the studies were funded by drug manufacturers with possible interests in the results of the studies. 
Key results 
The results show little or no difference between BtA and BtB in the main measures of overall improvement and safety, including the total number of adverse (unwanted or harmful) events. There was also little or no difference between BtA and BtB in the self‐evaluations reported by the study participants. Based on the results we would expect that, out of 1000 people with cervical dystonia treated with BtB, there would be 362 more people who experience dry mouth/sore throat compared to 1000 people treated with BtA. The studies which looked at the duration of effect showed little or no difference between BtA and BtB. None of the studies examined the impact of either Bt on quality of life. 
Quality of the evidence 
All of the studies included participants that were different to the average person who suffers from cervical dystonia. To be included participants had to have a history of successful treatment with Bt. People with certain types of cervical dystonia, in particular the forms that make the head turn backward or forward, were not allowed to participate in the studies. 
Not enough participants were included across the studies for us to be completely confident in the results for the total number of adverse events, the self‐reported evaluations by participants or the pain assessment. 
The quality of the evidence for overall improvement and total number of adverse events was low. The quality of the evidence for more sore throat/dry mouth in people receiving BtB is moderate. The quality of the evidence where participants gave their self‐assessments is low. 
No definite conclusions can be drawn regarding overall safety and long‐term utility of BtA compared to BtB in cervical dystonia.

## Plain Title
Comparing Two Types of Botulinum Toxin for Treating Twisted Neck (Cervical Dystonia)

## Rationale

**What is cervical dystonia?**
Cervical dystonia is a condition that makes the head twist or turn in ways a person cannot control. The neck muscles tighten on their own. This often causes pain. The head may tilt to one side, turn left or right, or tip forward or backward.

**Who does it affect?**
This condition is not very common. It affects about 57 to 280 people out of every million. Most people do not know why they get it. There is no cure.

**Why is this a problem?**
People with cervical dystonia often have trouble doing daily tasks. The twisted neck position can be painful. It can make life harder and affect how people feel about their quality of life. Since this condition usually lasts a long time, people need treatment for many years.

**What is botulinum toxin?**
Botulinum toxin is a natural substance. Doctors inject it into tight muscles. It helps the muscles relax. This can reduce the twisting and pain. There are different types of botulinum toxin. Type A (BtA) and Type B (BtB) can both treat cervical dystonia.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors usually try BtA first. But BtB is another choice. Researchers wanted to know if one works better than the other. They also wanted to know if one is safer.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at three studies. These studies compared BtA to BtB. All participants got one treatment session. Then researchers watched them for 16 to 20 weeks.

**Who was in the studies?**
A total of 270 people took part. Most were women (about 63 out of 100). The average age was 53 years. People had cervical dystonia for about 7 to 8 years before joining. Most had moderate symptoms. All had been treated successfully with botulinum toxin before.

**Who was not included?**
People with certain types of cervical dystonia could not join. This included people whose heads tipped far forward or backward.

**How long did the study last?**
People stayed in the studies for 16 to 20 weeks after treatment.

**Who paid for the studies?**
Drug companies paid for all three studies. These companies make the treatments being tested.

## Results

**What did researchers find about effectiveness?**
The two types of botulinum toxin worked about the same. There was little or no difference in how much they helped. People who got BtA improved about as much as people who got BtB. Both groups had similar pain relief.

**What about side effects?**
The total number of unwanted effects was similar for both treatments. But there was one clear difference. People who got BtB had more dry mouth and sore throat. Out of 1,000 people treated with BtB, about 362 more would have dry mouth or sore throat compared to 1,000 people treated with BtA.

**How long did the effects last?**
The studies that checked found little or no difference. Both types lasted about the same amount of time.

**What was not studied?**
None of the studies looked at quality of life. This is an important gap.

**What do these results mean?**
Both BtA and BtB can help people with cervical dystonia. They work about equally well. BtB causes more dry mouth and sore throat. Doctors and patients can use this information when choosing treatment.

**What are the limits of these findings?**
The studies were small. They only followed people for a short time. The people in the studies were not like all people with cervical dystonia. All had been treated successfully before. Some types of cervical dystonia were not included.

**What is the quality of this evidence?**
The quality was low to moderate. More research is needed. Larger studies that follow people longer would help. Studies should include all types of cervical dystonia.

**Final conclusion**
We cannot make firm conclusions about which treatment is better or safer over the long term. Both options can help people with cervical dystonia."
10.1002-14651858.CD004418.pub4-abstract.txt,"Initial antibiotic treatment for coverage of 'atypical' pathogens for community‐acquired pneumonia in hospitalized adults 
Pneumonia is a serious lung infection and is usually treated with antibiotics. Bacteria which cause community‐acquired pneumonia (CAP, pneumonia contracted outside healthcare settings) are traditionally divided into 'typical' and 'atypical', each dictating a different antibiotic treatment. Atypical bacteria include, Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae). The main 'typical' agent causing CAP is Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae). It is usually not possible to determine which of the many potential agents is the cause of CAP, so that antibiotic treatment is empirical, customarily covering both typical and atypical bacteria. While typical coverage is essential, the necessity of the atypical coverage has not been proven. In the previous version of this review we showed that there was no advantage to the atypical arm. Given the persisting inconsistency between current guidelines for treatment of pneumonia and the available evidence, we undertook to update this systematic review. 
This Cochrane review looked at trials comparing antibiotic regimens with atypical coverage to those without, limited to hospitalized adults with CAP. We included 28 trials, involving 5939 patients. For the regimens tested, no advantage was found for regimens covering atypical bacteria in the major outcomes tested ‐ mortality and clinical efficacy. There was no significant difference between the groups in the frequency of total adverse events, or those requiring discontinuation of treatment. However, gastrointestinal events were less common in the atypical arm. 
There are limitations to this review in that a single study compared the addition of the atypical antibiotic to a typical antibiotic, the major question in clinical practice; most compared a single atypical antibiotic to a single typical antibiotic. Seventeen of the 27 trials were open label, 21 of the 27 studies were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies of which all but one was conducted by the manufacturer of the atypical antibiotic.

## Plain Title
Comparing Antibiotic Treatments for Lung Infections in Hospitalized Adults

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**
Pneumonia is a serious lung infection. When people get pneumonia outside of hospitals or clinics, doctors call it community-acquired pneumonia, or CAP.

**What causes it?**
Many different germs can cause CAP. Doctors group these germs into two types: ""typical"" and ""atypical."" The most common typical germ is called Streptococcus pneumoniae. The atypical germs include Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae.

**Why is this a problem?**
Doctors usually cannot tell which germ caused the pneumonia. So they must choose antibiotics without knowing the exact cause. Most doctors give antibiotics that work against both typical and atypical germs. However, no one has proven that covering atypical germs is necessary.

**Why was this study needed?**
Current treatment guidelines say to cover both types of germs. But earlier research showed no clear benefit from covering atypical germs. This study was needed to check if the guidelines match the evidence.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Researchers wanted to know if antibiotics covering atypical germs work better than antibiotics that do not cover these germs.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was a review of many studies. Researchers looked at 28 different trials. They combined the results to find patterns.

**Who was in the studies?**
The studies included 5,939 adults with CAP. All patients were sick enough to need hospital care.

**What did researchers compare?**
They compared two groups:
- One group got antibiotics that work against atypical germs
- The other group got antibiotics that do not work against atypical germs

**How long did the studies last?**
The review does not specify exact study lengths. Each original trial had its own time frame.

## Results

**What did researchers find?**
Researchers looked at several important outcomes:

**Deaths:** The number of patients who died was similar in both groups. Covering atypical germs did not save more lives.

**How well treatment worked:** Both types of antibiotics worked equally well. Patients got better at similar rates.

**Side effects:** Most side effects happened at similar rates in both groups. Patients did not need to stop treatment more often with either type of antibiotic. However, stomach problems like nausea and diarrhea were less common with atypical coverage.

**What does this mean for patients?**
For hospitalized adults with CAP, antibiotics covering atypical germs did not work better than those without this coverage. Both approaches were equally safe and effective.

**What are the study limitations?**
This review has some important limits:
- Only one study tested adding an atypical antibiotic to a typical one. This is what doctors actually do in practice.
- Most studies compared one atypical antibiotic alone to one typical antibiotic alone.
- In 17 of 27 trials, doctors and patients knew which treatment was given.
- Drug companies paid for 21 of 27 studies. In all but one case, the company made the atypical antibiotic being tested.

**What do researchers conclude?**
The evidence does not support always using antibiotics that cover atypical germs for hospitalized adults with CAP. Current treatment guidelines may need to change to match this evidence. More independent research is needed to confirm these findings."
10.1002-14651858.CD004474.pub2-abstract.txt,"Tongxinluo (a traditional Chinese medicine) capsules may help patients suffering from unstable angina 
Tongxinluo, in capsule form, is a traditional Chinese medicine which consists of herbs and insects. Traditionally it has been thought to have clinical benefits for patients with angina, including the reduction of the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and complications of some types of heart surgery. Some studies also suggest a possible benefit in reducing the frequency and severity of angina attacks and improving symptoms. However, none of these individual studies have been reviewed systematically. 
The review authors systematically reviewed evidence from 18 randomised controlled trials for the benefit of tongxinluo with or without other treatments, including routine care or placebo, for patients with unstable angina. All the trials were conducted in China. The total number of participants was 1413, ranging in age from 25 to 88 years. Most studies randomised patients to receive tongxinluo with conventional medication or conventional medications alone. 
There was some evidence from seven studies that tongxinluo improved the electrocardiogram (ECG) changes indicating ischaemia and reduced the number of people with no improvement or worsening of ECG (six studies). Some improvement in angina symptoms (10 studies) and reduced numbers of people showing no improvement or worsening of symptoms were apparent with tongxinluo. Tongxinluo appeared to be as effective as isosorbide mononitrate in three studies. A few cases of slight gastrointestinal discomfort were reported after giving tongxinluo in seven studies and three cases of breaking of tiny blood vessels under the skin (ecchymosis) in one study. 
The evidence suggested possible benefits relating to a range of outcomes among patients with unstable angina but all the studies were of poor quality and neither blinding nor allocation concealment were used. This makes it impossible to reach firm conclusions about the benefit of this treatment. Large, high quality, randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the possible benefit of tongxinluo for unstable angina and to suggest appropriate future use of this herbal medicine.

## Plain Title
Can a Chinese Herbal Medicine Called Tongxinluo Help People with Unstable Chest Pain from Heart Disease?

## Rationale

**What is unstable angina?**
Unstable angina is a type of chest pain. It happens when the heart does not get enough blood. This can be very serious. It may lead to a heart attack. People with this condition often feel pain or pressure in their chest. This can happen at rest or with little activity. It affects their daily life and can be scary.

**Why was this study needed?**
Tongxinluo is a traditional Chinese medicine. It comes in capsule form. It is made from herbs and insects. For many years, people have used it to treat chest pain. Some doctors think it may help prevent heart attacks. Others believe it may reduce chest pain attacks. It might also help patients feel better overall. However, no one had carefully looked at all the research together. The researchers wanted to see if tongxinluo really works. They wanted to know if it is safe.

**What did the researchers think would happen?**
The researchers thought tongxinluo might help patients with unstable angina. They believed it could reduce chest pain. They also thought it might improve heart test results.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was a review study. The researchers looked at 18 different studies. All studies were done in China. The studies tested tongxinluo in different ways. Most studies compared two groups of patients. One group took tongxinluo plus regular heart medicine. The other group took only regular heart medicine. Some studies compared tongxinluo to a fake pill called a placebo. A few studies compared tongxinluo to another heart medicine.

**Who was in the studies?**
A total of 1,413 people took part. They were between 25 and 88 years old. All had unstable angina. Both men and women were included.

**How long did the studies last?**
The review does not give exact times. Different studies lasted different lengths of time.

## Results

**What were the main results?**
The review found some possible benefits from tongxinluo:

Seven studies looked at heart test results. These tests are called ECGs. They show how well the heart is working. Tongxinluo seemed to improve these test results. Six studies found fewer people got worse when taking tongxinluo.

Ten studies looked at chest pain symptoms. Patients taking tongxinluo seemed to have less pain. Fewer people got worse or stayed the same.

Three studies compared tongxinluo to another medicine called isosorbide mononitrate. Tongxinluo worked about as well as this medicine.

**Was tongxinluo safe?**
Most people had no problems taking tongxinluo. Seven studies reported some mild stomach upset. This included feeling sick or having an upset stomach. One study found three people had tiny broken blood vessels under their skin. These side effects were not serious.

**What do these results mean?**
The results suggest tongxinluo might help people with unstable angina. However, there is an important problem. All the studies had poor quality. The studies did not use the best methods. For example, patients knew which treatment they were getting. The way patients were put into groups was not done properly. This means the results may not be accurate.

**What are the main conclusions?**
The researchers cannot say for sure that tongxinluo works. The evidence is not strong enough. Better studies are needed. These studies should be larger. They should use better methods. Patients should not know which treatment they get. Only then can doctors know if tongxinluo really helps. Until better studies are done, doctors cannot recommend tongxinluo based on this evidence alone."

Review Question 
What are the risks and benefits of eating food early, versus delaying food for at least 24 hours after abdominal gynaecologic surgery? 
Background 
Physicians often delay giving food and drink to women after abdominal gynaecologic surgery (uterine fibroids, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, uterine and ovarian cancer) until bowel function recommences (typically 24 hours after surgery). This is to reduce the risk of complications such as vomiting, gastrointestinal disruptions and wound rupturing or leakage. However, it has been suggested that some women may recover more quickly if food is introduced earlier. We reviewed evidence from randomised controlled trials of early and delayed feeding after abdominal gynaecologic surgery. 
Study Characteristics 
We assessed evidence on the following outcomes:
1. Nausea, vomiting, cramping abdominal pain, bloating, abdominal distension, wound complication, deep venous thrombosis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia. 
2. Time to first: bowel sound, gas, stool, start of regular diet.
3. Length of hospital stay
Early feeding was defined as having fluids or food within 24 hours of surgery. Delayed feeding was defined as having fluids or food 24 hours after surgery, and only if there are bowel sounds, passage of gas or stool, and a feeling of hunger. 
The evidence is current to April 2014
Key Results 
We included five published studies of 631 women, mainly with gynaecologic cancer.
Recovery of bowel function was faster in those with early feeding. There was no difference in rates of nausea or vomiting, abdominal distension, need for a postoperative nasogastric tube or time to first bowel movement, but early feeding was associated with a shorter time to bowel sounds and onset of gas. The early feeding group resumed a solid diet 1½ days sooner than those having delayed feeding and the hospital stay was one day shorter. Also, the early feeding group were more satisfied with the feeding schedule, although only one study reported this. 
Early feeding appeared safe, without increased postoperative complications and with fewer infectious complications overall. 
Quality of the Evidence 
Most of the evidence was moderate quality. The main limitation was lack of blinding, which could influence the findings for subjective outcomes such as self‐reported symptoms, hospital stay, patients' satisfaction and quality of life. 
Conclusions 
The evidence suggests that eating and drinking on the first day after abdominal gynaecologic surgery is safe and could reduce the length of hospital stay. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Early Eating After Surgery for Women's Reproductive Organs

## Plain Title

Is it safe for women to eat soon after belly surgery on their reproductive organs, or should they wait?

## Rationale

**What is the health issue?**

Some women need surgery on their belly to treat problems with their reproductive organs. These problems include growths in the uterus, tissue growing where it should not, cysts on the ovaries, or cancer of the uterus or ovaries.

**What usually happens after surgery?**

Doctors often tell women not to eat or drink for at least 24 hours after this type of surgery. They wait until the bowels start working again. Doctors do this because they worry that eating too soon might cause problems. These problems could include throwing up, stomach issues, or wounds that break open or leak.

**Why was this study needed?**

Some doctors think women might get better faster if they eat sooner after surgery. The researchers wanted to find out if eating early is safe. They also wanted to know if eating early helps women recover faster than waiting to eat.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

The researchers looked at five studies that were already done. These studies included 631 women total. Most of these women had cancer of the reproductive organs.

**What did the studies compare?**

The studies compared two groups of women:
- Early feeding group: Women who ate or drank within 24 hours after surgery
- Delayed feeding group: Women who waited at least 24 hours to eat or drink. They only ate after their bowels made sounds, they passed gas or stool, or they felt hungry.

**What did researchers measure?**

They looked at problems like:
- Feeling sick to the stomach or throwing up
- Belly pain, bloating, or swelling
- Wound problems
- Blood clots in the legs
- Bladder infections
- Lung infections

They also measured:
- How long until bowels started working
- How long until women could eat normal food
- How many days women stayed in the hospital

## Results

**What did the study find?**

Women who ate early got better faster. Their bowels started working sooner. They could pass gas sooner than women who waited to eat.

Women who ate early started eating solid food 1 and a half days sooner. They also went home from the hospital one day earlier.

**Were there any problems?**

Early eating was safe. The two groups had the same rates of:
- Feeling sick or throwing up
- Belly swelling
- Needing a tube through the nose to the stomach
- Time until first bowel movement

Women who ate early actually had fewer infections overall.

One study asked women how they felt about when they could eat. Women who ate early were happier with their feeding schedule.

**What do the results mean?**

The evidence shows that eating and drinking on the first day after belly surgery is safe. It does not cause more problems. It may help women leave the hospital sooner.

**How good was the evidence?**

Most of the evidence was of moderate quality. This means we can trust most of the findings. The main issue was that people in the studies knew which group they were in. This could affect how they reported things like symptoms or how satisfied they felt.

**What is the main conclusion?**

Women can safely eat and drink on the first day after belly surgery on their reproductive organs. Eating early may help them recover faster and go home sooner."

Joint replacements are common procedures and treatment of choice for those with intractable joint pain and disability arising from arthropathy of the hip or knee. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation is considered integral to the outcome of joint replacement. 
Five trials (619 participants) met the inclusion criteria; two addressed inpatient rehabilitation (261 participants) and three (358 participants) home‐based settings. There were no trials addressing outpatient centre‐based programmes. Pooling of data was not possible due to differences in study design and outcomes used. Methodological assessment showed all trials were of low quality. For inpatient settings early commencement of rehabilitation and clinical pathways led to more rapid attainment of functional milestones (disability) (Functional Independence Measure (FIM) transfer WMD 0.5, 95% CI 0.15, 0.85, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 6, FIM ambulation WMD 1.55 (95%CI 0.96, 2.14), NNTB = 3), shorter hospital stay, fewer post‐operative complications and reduced costs in the first three to four months.

The optimal intensity, frequency and effects of rehabilitation over a longer period and associated social costs need further study. Future research should focus on improving methodological and scientific rigour of clinical trials, and use of standardised outcome measures, so that results can be pooled for statistical analysis.

## Plain Title
Does Team-Based Rehab Help People After Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Many people have long-term joint pain in their hip or knee. This pain can make it hard to walk, work, and do daily tasks. When the pain does not go away with other treatments, doctors may suggest joint replacement surgery. This means taking out the damaged joint and putting in a new one made of metal or plastic.

**Why was this study needed?**

After joint replacement surgery, patients need help to get better. Rehab means working with a team of health workers. This team may include doctors, nurses, and physical therapists. They help patients learn to move again and get stronger. Researchers wanted to know if this team-based rehab really helps patients recover better and faster.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

The researchers wanted to see if team-based rehab programs work well for people after hip or knee replacement. They looked at different types of rehab: some done in the hospital and some done at home.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This study looked at results from 5 other studies. In total, 619 people took part in these studies. All of these people had hip or knee replacement surgery.

Two studies (261 people) looked at rehab done in the hospital. Three studies (358 people) looked at rehab done at home. No studies looked at rehab done at an outpatient center.

The researchers could not combine all the numbers from these studies. This is because each study was done differently and measured different things. The researchers also found that all 5 studies had some problems with how they were done.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included adults who had hip or knee replacement surgery. The studies did not give details about exact ages or whether more men or women took part.

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies followed patients for different amounts of time. Some checked on patients for 3 to 4 months. Others followed patients for 6 months after surgery.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

**For rehab in the hospital:**

When patients started rehab early and followed a clear plan, good things happened:
- They could move and walk better and faster
- They left the hospital sooner
- They had fewer problems after surgery
- The care cost less money in the first 3 to 4 months

**For rehab at home:**

When a team of health workers helped patients at home:
- Patients could do more things on their own
- Their quality of life got better
- They spent less time in the hospital
- These benefits lasted for 6 months

**What does this mean?**

Team-based rehab that starts early can help people do more after hip or knee replacement surgery. It can help them move better and get back to their normal life.

**What questions remain?**

The researchers could not answer some important questions:
- How often should patients do rehab?
- How hard should the exercises be?
- Does rehab help for more than 6 months?
- What are the full costs to patients and families?

**What needs to happen next?**

Future studies need to be done better. They should:
- Use the same ways to measure how well patients do
- Follow patients for longer than 6 months
- Be more careful about how they collect information

This will help doctors know the best way to help patients recover after joint replacement surgery."

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect and safety of bisphosphonates in increasing bone mineral density, reducing fractures and improving clinical function in people with osteogenesis imperfecta. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. 
Background 
Osteogenesis imperfecta is also known as brittle bone disease. It is a genetic condition which can be passed on from a parent to child or occur in the child without any other family history. An affected person is at risk for frequent breaks of the long bones or collapse of the bones of the spine. There is no cure for osteogenesis imperfecta and treatment is mostly supportive. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 28 April 2016.
Study characteristics 
This review looked at trials studying one of the groups of medications known as bisphosphonates which are more typically used to treat osteoporosis. They are used in osteogenesis imperfecta to try and reduce the number of bone fractures in affected individuals. 
We included 14 trials, and most of these did not show a major reduction in fractures in affected individuals when treated with bisphosphonates. 
Key results 
Each trial independently showed significant improvements in bone mineral density after treatment with oral or intravenous bisphosphonates. Bone pain, growth and quality of life indicators were not reported in enough detail and the effects of this treatment need further investigation. The long‐term effectiveness and safety of bisphosphates, as well as dose and duration of therapy, require extended evaluation 
Quality of the evidence 
The majority of trials analysed were small and not powered to show a statistically significant difference in many outcome measures. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Bisphosphonate Therapy for Osteogenesis Imperfecta

## Plain Title
Do Bone-Strengthening Drugs Help People with Brittle Bone Disease?

## Rationale

**What is brittle bone disease?**

Brittle bone disease is also called osteogenesis imperfecta. People with this condition have very weak bones. Their bones break much more easily than other people's bones.

**What causes this condition?**

This disease is passed down in families through genes. Sometimes a parent gives it to their child. Other times, it happens in a child with no family history of the disease.

**Why is this a problem for patients?**

People with brittle bone disease face serious challenges. Their long bones (like arms and legs) break very often. The bones in their spine can also collapse. These problems make daily life very hard. Right now, there is no cure for this disease. Doctors can only help manage the symptoms.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Researchers wanted to test if certain drugs could help. These drugs are called bisphosphonates. Doctors usually give these drugs to older people with weak bones (a condition called osteoporosis). Researchers thought these same drugs might help people with brittle bone disease. They hoped the drugs would make bones stronger and reduce the number of breaks.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

The main goal was to see if bisphosphonates could:
- Make bones stronger and denser
- Reduce how often bones break
- Help people move and function better in daily life
- Be safe to use

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at many other studies that had already been done. They found 14 different trials to review. They looked at evidence collected up to April 28, 2016.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included people with brittle bone disease. The review does not give specific details about ages or gender of participants.

**What treatment did people receive?**

Some people got bisphosphonate drugs. Others got a fake treatment (called a placebo) or no treatment. The drugs were given in two ways:
- By mouth (oral)
- Through a vein (intravenous)

**How long did the studies last?**

The review does not specify exact time periods. Different studies likely lasted different amounts of time.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The results showed mixed findings:

**Bone strength improved:** All 14 studies found that bisphosphonates made bones denser. This means the bones had more minerals and were stronger. This happened with both types of treatment (by mouth and through a vein).

**Broken bones did not decrease much:** Most studies did not show a big reduction in bone breaks. This was disappointing because preventing breaks was a main goal.

**Other effects unclear:** The studies did not give enough information about:
- Whether bone pain got better
- Whether children grew normally
- Whether quality of life improved

**What does this mean for patients?**

These drugs can make bones denser and stronger. However, this may not prevent bones from breaking as much as hoped. More research is needed to understand if these drugs truly help patients feel better and live better.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

The researchers said more studies are needed. Future research should look at:
- Long-term safety of these drugs
- How well they work over many years
- What dose works best
- How long people should take them

**Study limitations:**

Most of the 14 studies were small. They did not include enough people to give clear answers about many important questions. This makes it hard to know for certain how well these drugs work.

10.1002-14651858.CD005231.pub3-abstract.txt,"Can smokers be helped to reduce the harm caused by cigarette smoking by smoking fewer cigarettes or using different tobacco products? 
Background 
The best thing to do to reduce the harms caused by smoking is to quit, but some people may not want to do this or may feel that they are unable to stop smoking completely. Cutting down the number of cigarettes smoked daily or using different tobacco products, such as chewing tobacco or low‐tar cigarettes, may reduce some of the harm caused by smoking. It may also help people to stop smoking completely in the long term. On the other hand, reducing smoking or using other tobacco products may not improve health and could reduce a person's motivation to quit smoking altogether. It is important that we review the evidence to find out whether these approaches could help smokers who do not want to or cannot quit to reduce the harm caused by their smoking. We were mainly interested in whether these approaches improved the health of smokers, but also looked at smoking reduction and quitting rates. 
Study characteristics 
We found 20 randomised controlled trials that tested ways to help people to cut down the number of cigarettes they smoked. Some of these just advised smokers to smoke less, but most also provided them with a product to help them cut down: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline, bupropion, electronic cigarettes (ecigs), or snus (a form of smokeless, oral tobacco). We also found four randomized controlled trials that tested the effects of using cigarettes designed to reduce the damage caused by smoking: reduced tar, carbon or nicotine cigarettes. Most of the studies used NRT to help people to reduce their smoking. All of the studies included people who were not planning to quit smoking soon. The research is current to October 2015. 
Key results 
Eight studies (with 3081 smokers) found that using NRT roughly doubled the likelihood of halving the number of cigarettes smoked each day, compared to using a placebo. Using NRT in this way also nearly doubled the likelihood of quitting completely. One trial each tested bupropion, varenicline, ecigs and snus to help reduce the harms caused by smoking, and there was no evidence that any of these treatments helped smokers to reduce the number of cigarettes they were smoking each day. This may be because there has not yet been enough research into these methods. Only one of the trials testing cigarettes designed to reduce risk measured their effect on the number of people quitting smoking. It found that people were not more likely to quit smoking if they used reduced‐nicotine cigarettes than if they smoked their usual cigarettes. We did not find any trials which reported the long‐term health effects of the treatments, and so it remains uncertain how much health benefit there is from reducing the number of cigarettes smoked each day or smoking cigarettes designed to be less harmful. 
Quality of evidence 
The tobacco industry funded three of the included studies of cigarettes designed to reduce risk. None of the studies looked at whether there had been a long‐term change in the health of the users. We rate the quality of the evidence looking at how many people quit smoking as 'low' or 'very low', generally because the findings are based on a small number of studies. We need more studies to investigate methods of reducing the harm caused by continued smoking. These need to measure the health of the users over a long period.

## Plain Title
Can People Who Smoke Be Helped to Reduce Harm by Smoking Less or Using Different Tobacco Products?

## Rationale

**What is the problem?**
Smoking cigarettes harms health. The best way to avoid this harm is to quit smoking. But some people do not want to quit. Others feel they cannot stop.

**What might help?**
Smoking fewer cigarettes each day might reduce some harm. Using different tobacco products might also help. These products include chewing tobacco or cigarettes with less tar. These approaches might help people's health. They might also help people quit smoking later on.

**Why might this not work?**
Smoking less might not improve health. It might make people less likely to quit completely. We need to review the evidence. We need to know if these approaches truly reduce harm.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Researchers wanted to know if these methods improved health. They also looked at whether people smoked less. They checked if people quit smoking completely.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**
Researchers found 24 studies. These were randomized controlled trials. This means people were put into groups by chance.

Twenty studies tested ways to help people smoke fewer cigarettes. Some studies just told people to smoke less. Most studies also gave people products to help. These products included:
- Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). This gives nicotine without smoking.
- Varenicline. This is a medicine that helps with quitting.
- Bupropion. This is another medicine that helps with quitting.
- Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). These heat liquid to make vapor.
- Snus. This is tobacco you put in your mouth.

Four studies tested special cigarettes. These cigarettes were designed to cause less damage. They had less tar, carbon, or nicotine.

**Who was in the studies?**
All studies included people who smoked. These people were not planning to quit soon. Most studies used NRT to help people.

**When was this research done?**
The research includes studies up to October 2015.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

**Using NRT to smoke less:**
Eight studies included 3,081 smokers. People who used NRT were twice as likely to cut their smoking in half. This was compared to people who used a fake treatment (placebo). Using NRT also nearly doubled the chance of quitting completely.

**Using other products:**
One study tested bupropion. One study tested varenicline. One study tested e-cigarettes. One study tested snus. None of these studies showed that these products helped people smoke less. This might be because we need more research.

**Using special cigarettes:**
Only one study tested cigarettes with less nicotine. It checked if people quit smoking. People using these cigarettes were not more likely to quit. They did about the same as people smoking regular cigarettes.

**What about health benefits?**
No studies measured long-term health effects. We do not know how much these methods improve health. We do not know if smoking less truly makes people healthier. We do not know if special cigarettes are less harmful.

**Quality of the evidence:**
Three studies were paid for by tobacco companies. These studies tested special cigarettes. No studies looked at long-term health changes. The quality of evidence is low or very low. This is because there are not many studies.

**What do we need?**
We need more studies. These studies should measure health over a long time. They should test different ways to reduce harm from smoking.

**Conclusions:**
NRT can help people smoke fewer cigarettes. It can also help people quit. Other methods need more research. We do not yet know if these approaches truly improve health over time."
10.1002-14651858.CD005293.pub2-abstract.txt,"Treatments for accidental damage during surgery to the nerves supplying sensation to the tongue, lower lip and chin 
Review question 
The main question addressed by this review is how effective are different treatments and what are the best timings for these treatments following accidental damage during surgery to the nerves that supply sensation to the tongue, lower lip and chin. 
Background 
The nerves (alveolar and lingual) supplying sensation to the tongue, lower lip and chin, may be injured as a result of surgical treatments to the mouth and face, including surgery to remove lower wisdom teeth. The vast majority (90%) of these injuries are temporary and get better within eight weeks. However if they last for longer than six months they are considered to be permanent. Damage to these nerves can lead to altered sensation in the region of the lower lip and chin, or tongue or both. Furthermore, damage to the nerve supplying the tongue may lead to altered taste perception. These injuries can affect people's quality of life leading to emotional problems, problems with socialising and disabilities. Accidental injury after surgery can also give rise to legal action. 
There are many interventions or treatments available, surgical and non‐surgical, that may enhance recovery, including improving sensation. They can be grouped as. 
1. Surgical – a variety of procedures. 2. Laser treatment – low‐level laser treatment has been used to treat partial loss of sensation. 3. Medical – treatment with drugs including antiepileptics, antidepressants and painkillers. 4. Counselling – including cognitive behavioural and relaxation therapy, changing behaviour and hypnosis. 
Study characteristics 
The Cochrane Oral Health Group carried out this review, and the evidence is current as of 9 October 2013. There are two studies included, both published in 1996, which compared low‐level laser treatment to placebo or fake treatment for partial loss of sensation following surgery to the lower jaw. There were 15 participants in one study and 16 in the other, their ages ranging from 17 to 55 years. All had suffered accidental damage to nerves of the lower jaw and tongue causing some loss of sensation following surgery. 
Key results 
Low‐level laser therapy was the only treatment to be evaluated in the included studies and this was compared to fake or placebo laser therapy. No studies were found that evaluated other surgical, medical or counselling treatments. 
There was some evidence of an improvement when participants reported whether or not sensation was better in the lip and chin areas with low‐level laser therapy. This is based on the results of a single, small study, so the results should be interpreted with caution. 
No studies reported on the effects of the treatment on other outcomes such as pain, difficulty eating or speaking or taste. No studies reported on quality of life or harm. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall quality of the evidence is very low as a result of limitations in the conduct and reporting of the two included studies and the low number of participants, and evidence from participants with only partial sensory loss.

## Plain Title
Treatments for Nerve Damage in the Mouth After Surgery

## Rationale

### What is the problem?
Some nerves in the mouth give feeling to the tongue, lower lip, and chin. Surgery in the mouth can hurt these nerves by accident. This can happen when doctors remove wisdom teeth or do other mouth surgery.

### What happens when these nerves are damaged?
When these nerves are hurt, people may lose feeling in their tongue, lower lip, or chin. Some people may not taste food the same way. Most people get better in eight weeks. But if the problem lasts more than six months, it may be permanent.

### Why does this matter?
Nerve damage can make life hard. People may feel upset or sad. They may have trouble eating or talking. They may not want to be around other people. This problem can also lead to legal issues.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors use many treatments to help fix nerve damage. These include surgery, laser treatment, drugs, and counseling. Researchers wanted to know which treatments work best. They also wanted to know when to use these treatments.

### What did researchers hope to find?
Researchers wanted to see if any treatment could help people get their feeling back. They wanted to find the best way to help patients recover.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked for all studies that tested treatments for nerve damage in the mouth. They found two studies from 1996. Both studies tested one type of treatment called low-level laser therapy.

### Who was in the studies?
The two studies had 31 people total. One study had 15 people. The other study had 16 people. The people were between 17 and 55 years old. All of them had lost some feeling after mouth surgery. The nerves to their lower jaw or tongue were damaged.

### What did the studies compare?
Both studies compared real laser treatment to fake laser treatment. The fake treatment looked the same but did not actually work. This helped researchers see if the real laser made a difference.

### How long did the studies last?
The abstract does not say how long people stayed in the studies.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
Only laser treatment was tested in these studies. No studies looked at surgery, drugs, or counseling.

One small study showed some good results. People said their feeling got better in the lip and chin area after laser treatment. But this was just one small study with few people. The results may not be reliable.

### What was not measured?
The studies did not look at many important things. They did not measure pain. They did not check if people had trouble eating or speaking. They did not test if taste got better. They did not ask about quality of life. They did not report if the treatment caused any harm.

### What do the results mean?
The evidence is very weak. Only two small studies were found. Both studies had problems with how they were done. Only 31 people were tested. All of them had only partial loss of feeling, not complete loss.

### What do researchers conclude?
There is not enough good evidence to know if laser treatment really works. More and better studies are needed. Researchers need to test other treatments too. They need to include more people and measure more outcomes.

In low‐ and middle‐income countries, postpartum haemorrhage is a major cause of maternal deaths and ill health. In high‐income countries, the problems are much less but there is still a small risk of major bleeding problems for women after giving birth. Active management of the third stage of labour, which is generally used to reduce blood loss at birth, consists of giving the mother a drug that helps the uterus to contract, early cord clamping and controlled cord traction to deliver the placenta. Different drugs have been tried and generally either intramuscular oxytocin or intramuscular syntometrine is given. Carbetocin is an oxytocin agonist. Oxytocin agonists are a group of drugs that mimic the oxytocin action, oxytocin being the natural hormone that helps to reduce blood loss at birth. This review includes 11 randomised controlled trials involving 2635 women. The trials compared carbetocin against either oxytocin or syntometrine given after delivery, vaginally or by caesarean section. The comparison between intramuscular carbetocin and oxytocin showed that there was no difference in the risk of heavy bleeding, but that women who received carbetocin were less likely to require other medications to produce uterine contractions following caesarean sections. Comparisons between carbetocin and syntometrine showed that women who received carbetocin had less blood loss compared to women who received syntometrine after vaginal delivery, and were much less likely to experience side effects such as nausea and vomiting. The incidence of hypertension at 30 and 60 minutes post delivery was also significantly lower in women who received carbetocin compared to those who received syntometrine. Five of the 11 studies were known to be supported by a pharmaceutical company.

## Plain Title
Testing a Drug Called Carbetocin to Prevent Heavy Bleeding After Childbirth

## Rationale

Heavy bleeding after giving birth is called postpartum hemorrhage. This is a serious problem for new mothers. In poorer countries, this heavy bleeding causes many mothers to die or become very sick. Even in richer countries, some women still face risks of major bleeding after birth.

Doctors try to prevent this bleeding by using a method called active management. This means giving the mother a drug right after birth. The drug helps the womb squeeze tight. This squeezing helps stop the bleeding. Doctors also clamp the cord early and help deliver the placenta.

Different drugs can help the womb contract. Doctors usually give oxytocin or syntometrine as shots. These drugs work well but are not perfect. Carbetocin is a newer drug. It works like oxytocin, which is the natural hormone in the body that stops bleeding after birth.

Researchers wanted to test if carbetocin works better than the other drugs. They wanted to see if it could prevent heavy bleeding. They also wanted to check if it caused fewer side effects. This study was needed to find the best and safest drug for mothers after giving birth.

## Trial Design

This review looked at 11 different studies. These studies included 2,635 women in total. All studies were randomized controlled trials. This means women were put into groups by chance. This type of study gives the most reliable results.

The studies compared carbetocin to two other drugs: oxytocin and syntometrine. Women received these drugs right after delivery. Some women gave birth through the vagina. Other women had cesarean sections, which means surgery to deliver the baby.

Doctors gave the drugs as shots into the muscle. Then they watched to see how much the women bled. They also checked for side effects like feeling sick or vomiting. The studies measured blood pressure too.

The women in these studies had just given birth. The studies included both types of delivery: vaginal birth and cesarean section. The exact ages of the women were not given in this summary. Researchers watched the women for at least 60 minutes after birth to see the results.

## Results

The main results showed important differences between the drugs.

When researchers compared carbetocin to oxytocin, they found no difference in heavy bleeding rates. Both drugs worked about the same to prevent major blood loss. However, women who got carbetocin had one advantage. They needed fewer extra drugs to make the womb contract after cesarean sections. This was especially helpful for women having surgery.

When researchers compared carbetocin to syntometrine, the results were more clear. Women who got carbetocin lost less blood after vaginal delivery compared to women who got syntometrine. Carbetocin also caused far fewer side effects. Women who got carbetocin felt sick or vomited much less often. This is important because feeling sick after birth makes recovery harder.

Blood pressure results also favored carbetocin. Women who got carbetocin had lower rates of high blood pressure. Doctors checked this at 30 minutes and 60 minutes after birth. Both times, carbetocin was better than syntometrine.

These findings are important for doctors and mothers. Carbetocin appears to work as well as oxytocin for preventing bleeding. It works better than syntometrine in some ways. Most importantly, it causes fewer uncomfortable side effects.

One important note: Five of the 11 studies received support from a drug company. This means the company that makes carbetocin helped pay for some research. Readers should know this when thinking about the results.

The researchers concluded that carbetocin is a good option for preventing bleeding after birth. It works well and causes fewer problems for mothers. More research may help doctors know when to use each drug."
10.1002-14651858.CD005974.pub5-abstract.txt,"Are oral homeopathic medicinal products effective and safe to prevent and treat acute respiratory tract infections in children? 
Review question 
We investigated whether oral homeopathic medicinal products are effective and safe to prevent or treat acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in children compared with an inactive (placebo) treatment or other medicines. 
Background 
Most respiratory infections resolve without treatment, but sometimes symptoms persist after the initial infection has gone. Treatment is therefore aimed at relieving symptoms. Respiratory infections are commonly caused by viruses, especially colds and flu, though some lung and ear infections are caused by bacteria. It may be difficult to distinguish between viral and bacterial infections, and they may coexist. Antibiotics are often prescribed for respiratory infections even though they are ineffective against viruses. 
Children have on average three to six respiratory tract infections annually. Although most are mild and treatable, they sometimes require hospital treatment, and very rarely result in death. 
Homeopathy may treat respiratory infections with few side effects, but its effectiveness and safety has not been well researched. 
We assessed evidence from randomised controlled trials (studies that allocate people by chance to receive treatment), which is the best way to assess the safety and efficacy of medical treatments. 
Search date 
Our evidence is current to 27 November 2017.
Study characteristics 
We included eight studies involving 1562 children that compared oral homeopathic treatment to either placebo or standard treatment to prevent or treat respiratory infections in children. All studies investigated upper respiratory tract (from the nose to the windpipe (trachea)) infections, but one combined reporting of upper and lower respiratory tract (from the windpipe to the lungs and pleura (membranes covering the lungs)) infections, so the numbers of children with upper or lower infections is unknown. 
Study funding sources 
Three studies received funding from homeopathy manufacturers; one reported support from a non‐government organisation; two received government support; one was cosponsored by a university; and one did not report funding support. 
Key results 
Studies investigated a range of interventions for various illnesses and populations using different outcome measures, so only a small number could be combined for analysis. All moderate‐quality studies (low risk of bias) showed little or no beneficial effects for homeopathic medicinal products, whether individualised by a trained homeopath or a standard, non‐individualised commercially available therapy. Where results could be combined, there was probably little or no difference in benefit on short‐ or long‐term cure, or in prevention of ARTI. 
Two low‐quality studies (unclear or high risk of bias) showed some benefit of homeopathic medicinal products for a limited number of outcomes. One study showed a reduction in disease severity for the homeopathy group at some time points. The other study showed a reduction in number of respiratory infections over the following year in the treatment groups, although more than a quarter of participants were not accounted for in the results. There was no difference between homeopathy and placebo groups for parents' time off work, antibiotic use, or adverse effects. Consequently, there is no convincing evidence homeopathic medicinal products are effective in treating ARTIs in children. We are unsure about safety because data on adverse events were poorly reported. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated evidence as moderate or low quality for most outcomes. Three outcomes provided very low‐quality evidence because study populations and results differed significantly among studies; there were significant limitations in study design and reporting; and sample sizes were small.

Do Homeopathic Medicines Help Prevent or Treat Breathing Infections in Children?

## Rationale

**What are breathing infections?**
Breathing infections affect the nose, throat, windpipe, or lungs. Most children get 3 to 6 of these infections each year. These infections are often called colds or flu.

**What causes these infections?**
Most breathing infections are caused by viruses. Some lung and ear infections are caused by germs called bacteria. It can be hard to tell the difference between virus and bacteria infections.

**Why are these infections a problem?**
Most breathing infections are mild and get better on their own. But sometimes symptoms last even after the infection is gone. A few children need to go to the hospital. Very rarely, children can die from these infections.

**How are these infections treated now?**
Doctors often give antibiotics for breathing infections. But antibiotics only work against bacteria. They do not work against viruses. The main goal of treatment is to help children feel better.

**Why study homeopathic medicines?**
Homeopathy is a type of treatment that uses very small amounts of natural substances. Some people believe homeopathic medicines might help treat breathing infections with few side effects. But we do not know if these medicines really work or if they are safe for children.

**Why was this study needed?**
Researchers wanted to find out if homeopathic medicines taken by mouth can prevent or treat breathing infections in children. They also wanted to know if these medicines are safe.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**
This was a review of research studies. Researchers looked at 8 studies that tested homeopathic medicines in children. These were high-quality studies where children were put into groups by chance. Some children got homeopathic medicine. Other children got fake medicine (called placebo) or standard treatment.

**Who was in these studies?**
A total of 1,562 children took part in all 8 studies combined. All studies looked at infections in the upper breathing tract (nose to windpipe). One study also included infections in the lower breathing tract (windpipe to lungs), but did not report these separately.

**What treatments were tested?**
Some studies tested homeopathic medicines chosen by a trained homeopath for each child. Other studies tested standard homeopathic products that anyone can buy.

**When was this research done?**
Researchers searched for studies up to November 27, 2017.

## Results

**What were the main results?**
The best-quality studies showed that homeopathic medicines probably do not work better than fake medicine. There was little or no difference in:
- How quickly children got better
- How long symptoms lasted
- Preventing future breathing infections

Two lower-quality studies showed some possible benefits. One study found that illness might be less severe at certain times. Another study found fewer infections in the next year. But this second study had problems. More than 1 out of 4 children were not included in the final results.

**Were there other benefits?**
There was no difference between homeopathic medicine and fake medicine for:
- How much time parents missed from work
- How often children needed antibiotics
- Side effects or safety problems

**What do these results mean?**
There is no convincing proof that homeopathic medicines work to treat breathing infections in children. We cannot be sure if these medicines are safe because the studies did not report safety information well enough.

**Quality of the research**
Most results were moderate or low quality. Some results were very low quality because:
- Studies looked at different types of children
- Studies had different results
- Studies were not well designed
- Not enough children were in the studies

**Conclusion**
Based on current research, homeopathic medicines do not appear to help prevent or treat breathing infections in children better than fake medicine or standard treatment."

Toxoplasmosis infection is caused by a parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. Eating or handling raw or insufficiently‐cooked meat, not washing hands thoroughly after gardening, handling contaminated soil or water, or contact with cats' faeces can cause infection. Usually it is asymptomatic and self‐limiting. Primary prevention involves educating the general public, filtering water and improving farm hygiene to reduce animal infection. 
If pregnant women have not previously been exposed to the parasite and develop antibodies while pregnant, the infection can be transmitted from the mother to the fetus (congenital toxoplasmosis). This is rare but potentially has serious consequences such as malformation, mental retardation, deafness and blindness of the infected infant, intrauterine death or stillbirth. The probability of infection is greater during the third trimester but the risk of the fetus developing major clinical signs is greater early in pregnancy. Pregnant women are often unaware of risk factors for congenital toxoplasmosis. Offering prenatal education could mean that women adopt simple behavioral measures to avoid toxoplasmosis. 
This review included two randomized controlled trials (involving 5455 women). Data could not be combined because each trial measured effectiveness in different ways. One study was from Canada and involved 432 women randomly assigned to a 10‐minute presentation during a prenatal class about toxoplasmosis prevention or to a usual prenatal class. Losses to follow‐up were high and 285 completed the post‐test questionnaire in the third trimester. Only 5% of the intervention women recalled having obtained information on toxoplasmosis prevention during prenatal classes. However, the authors concluded that prenatal education can effectively change pregnant women's behavior as it increased pet, personal and food hygiene. The other trial conducted in France involved 5023 pregnant women with no evidence of toxoplasmosis infection (seronegative) who were randomly assigned to receive a brochure and an audiotape containing information for toxoplasmosis prevention, or to a usual prenatal class. Losses to follow‐up were high and 2790 completed both pre‐test and post‐test questionnaire on behavior (44.5% loss to follow‐up), whereas 3949 women were tested for blood antibodies (22.4% loss to follow‐up). Women's behavior did not change after the intervention. Similarly, the seroconversion rate did not differ between groups (13 out of 2591 women seroconverted in the intervention and four out of 1358 in the control group). 
Both trials were judged as having low methodological quality as assessed by the GRADE approach. This limits our confidence in the results. Evidence supporting prenatal education to prevent congenital toxoplasmosis is therefore limited.

Teaching Pregnant Women How to Prevent Toxoplasmosis Infection

## Rationale

**What is toxoplasmosis?**
Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by a tiny parasite called Toxoplasma gondii. People can get this infection from eating raw or undercooked meat, touching cat poop, or not washing hands after gardening or touching dirt.

**Why does this matter for pregnant women?**
Most people who get this infection have no symptoms. The body fights it off on its own. But if a pregnant woman gets infected for the first time during pregnancy, she can pass it to her unborn baby. This is called congenital toxoplasmosis. It is rare, but it can cause serious problems.

**What problems can it cause?**
Babies infected before birth may have birth defects, mental disabilities, hearing loss, or blindness. Some babies may die before birth. The infection is more likely to happen in the last three months of pregnancy. But if infection happens early in pregnancy, the baby is more likely to have serious health problems.

**Why was this study needed?**
Many pregnant women do not know about the risks of toxoplasmosis. Researchers wanted to see if teaching pregnant women about toxoplasmosis could help them change their behavior. Simple actions like washing hands well and cooking meat fully could prevent infection.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at two studies that tested whether education could prevent toxoplasmosis in pregnancy. These studies included 5,455 pregnant women total.

**What happened in the first study?**
This study was done in Canada with 432 pregnant women. Some women watched a 10-minute talk about preventing toxoplasmosis during their prenatal class. Other women had their usual prenatal class without this information. Researchers asked women questions in their last three months of pregnancy. Only 285 women completed the final questionnaire. Many women dropped out of the study.

**What happened in the second study?**
This study was done in France with 5,023 pregnant women. None of these women had been infected with toxoplasmosis before. Some women received a booklet and an audio tape with information about preventing toxoplasmosis. Other women had their usual prenatal care. Researchers asked questions about behavior and tested blood for infection. Only 2,790 women completed both questionnaires. Only 3,949 women had blood tests done. Many women dropped out of this study too.

## Results

**What did the studies find?**

The two studies had different results.

**First study results:**
Only 5 out of 100 women remembered getting information about toxoplasmosis in their prenatal class. But the researchers said the education worked. Women who got the talk were better at washing hands, handling pets safely, and preparing food safely.

**Second study results:**
Women who got the booklet and tape did not change their behavior. The number of women who got infected was about the same in both groups. In the group that got education, 13 out of 2,591 women got infected. In the regular care group, 4 out of 1,358 women got infected.

**What do these results mean?**
The two studies gave different answers. One said education helped. One said it did not help. Many women dropped out of both studies. The studies were not done in the best way. This makes it hard to trust the results.

**What are the conclusions?**
There is not enough good evidence to know if teaching pregnant women about toxoplasmosis actually prevents infection. More research is needed. Better studies with more women who complete the full study would help answer this question. Right now, we cannot say for sure that prenatal education prevents congenital toxoplasmosis."
10.1002-14651858.CD006237.pub4-abstract.txt,"What are the best ways to help people with depression go back to work?
What is depression? 
Depression is a common mental health problem that can cause a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest in people, activities, and things that were once enjoyable. A person with depression may feel tearful, irritable, or tired most of the time, and may have problems with sleep, concentration, and memory. 
Depression may affect people's ability to work. People with depression may be absent from work (off sick), or feel less able to cope with working. 
Going back to work 
Reducing depressive symptoms may help people with depression to go back to work. Treatments include medications and psychological (talking) therapies, or a combination of both. Changes at the workplace could also help, such as: 
changing a person's tasks or working hours;
supporting them in a gradual return to work; or
helping them to cope better with certain work situations.
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
Work can improve a person's physical and mental well‑being; it helps build confidence and self‐esteem, allows people to socialise, and provides money. We wanted to find out if workplace changes and clinical programmes could help people with depression to return to work. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at whether workplace changes and clinical programmes affected the amount of sick leave taken by people with depression. Clinical programmes included: medicines (anti‐depressants); psychological therapies; improved healthcare by doctors; and other programmes such as exercise and diet.  
Search date: we included evidence published up to 4 April 2020. 
What we found 
We found 45 studies in 12,109 people with depression. The studies took place in Europe (34 studies), the USA (8), Australia (2) and Canada (1). 
The effects of 'care as usual' were compared with those of workplace changes and clinical programmes to find out: 
how many days people with depression were on sick leave
how many people with depression were off work;
people's symptoms of depression; and
how well people with depression could cope with their work.
What are the results of our review? 
Our main findings within the first year of follow‐up, for workplace changes or treatments compared with usual care, are listed below. 
Workplace changes combined with a clinical programme:
probably reduce the number of days on sick leave (on average, by 25 days for each person over one year; 9 studies; 1292 participants); 
do not reduce the number of people off work (2 studies; 1025 participants);
may reduce symptoms of depression (8 studies; 1091 participants); and
may improve ability to cope with work (5 studies; 926 participants).
Workplace changes alone:
may increase the number of days on sick leave (2 studies, 130 participants);
probably do not lead to more people off work (1 study; 226 participants);
probably do not affect symptoms of depression (4 studies; 390 participants); and
may not improve ability to cope with work (1 study; 48 participants).
Improved healthcare alone:
probably reduces the number of days on sick leave, by 20 days (in two, well‐conducted studies in 692 participants, although not in all 7 studies, in 1912 participants); 
probably reduces symptoms of depression (7 studies; 1808 participants); and
may reduce ability to cope with work (1 study; 604 participants).
Psychological therapies alone:
may reduce the number of days off work, by 15 days (9 studies; 1649 participants); and 
may reduce symptoms of depression (8 studies; 1255 participants).
We are uncertain if psychological therapies alone affect people's ability to cope with work (1 study; 58 participants). 
How reliable are these results? 
Our confidence in these results is mostly moderate to low. Some findings are based on small numbers of studies, in small numbers of participants. We also found limitations in the ways some studies were designed, conducted and reported. 
Key messages 
Combining workplace changes with a clinical programme probably helps people with depression to return to work more quickly and to take fewer days off sick. We need more evidence to assess which combination of workplace changes and clinical programmes works best. 
Improved healthcare probably also helps people with depression to take fewer days off sick. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Helping People with Depression Return to Work

## Plain Title
What Are the Best Ways to Help People with Depression Go Back to Work?

## Rationale

**What is depression?**

Depression is a common mental health problem. It makes people feel very sad for a long time. People with depression lose interest in things they used to enjoy. They may cry often or feel angry. They may feel tired all the time. Depression can make it hard to sleep, focus, or remember things.

**Why is this important?**

Depression can make it hard for people to work. Some people with depression cannot go to work at all. Others go to work but find it very hard to do their job.

Work is good for people. It helps them feel better about themselves. It lets them meet other people. It also gives them money to live.

**What might help?**

Some treatments can help reduce depression. These include medicines and talking with a therapist. Changes at work might also help. For example, a person might work fewer hours at first. Or they might do different tasks. Their boss might help them slowly return to full-time work.

**Why did we do this study?**

We wanted to find out what helps people with depression return to work. We looked at workplace changes and medical treatments. We wanted to know which ones work best.

## Trial Design

**How did we study this?**

We looked at 45 studies. These studies included 12,109 people with depression. Most studies took place in Europe. Some were in the USA, Australia, and Canada.

**What did we compare?**

We compared regular care with different types of help. We looked at:
- Workplace changes plus medical treatment
- Workplace changes alone
- Better healthcare alone
- Talking therapy alone

**What did we measure?**

We looked at four things:
- How many days people were off sick
- How many people could not work
- How bad their depression was
- How well they could do their job

We followed people for up to one year.

## Results

**What did we find?**

**Workplace changes plus medical treatment:**

This combination probably helps a lot. People took about 25 fewer sick days in one year. Their depression got better. They could do their work better. But the same number of people were still off work completely.

**Workplace changes alone:**

This did not help much. People may have taken more sick days. Their depression did not get better. They did not do their work better.

**Better healthcare alone:**

This probably helps. In two good studies, people took about 20 fewer sick days. Their depression got better. But they may have found work harder to cope with.

**Talking therapy alone:**

This may help. People took about 15 fewer sick days. Their depression got better. We are not sure if it helped them do their work better.

**What does this mean?**

The best approach seems to be combining workplace changes with medical treatment. This helps people with depression take fewer sick days. It also helps reduce their depression. It helps them cope better at work.

Better healthcare by itself also helps people take fewer sick days.

**How sure are we?**

We are fairly sure about most of these results. But some findings come from only a few small studies. Some studies had problems with how they were done. We need more research to be completely sure.

**What do we still need to know?**

We need more studies to find out exactly which combination works best. We need to know which workplace changes help most. We need to know which medical treatments work best with workplace changes.

**Bottom line:**

If you have depression and want to return to work, ask about both workplace changes and medical treatment. Using both together will probably help you the most. Better healthcare alone may also help you take fewer sick days."

Occupational injury rates among construction workers are the highest among the major industries. While various organisations have proposed several injury control strategies, their effectiveness for reducing the rate of injuries in the construction industry remains uncertain. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To find out which interventions are most effective for reducing on‐the‐job injuries in construction workers. 
Key messages 
We conducted a systematic search of the literature on preventing occupational injuries among construction workers. We included 17 studies in this updated review, rating the evidence as very low quality. Multifaceted interventions and company incentives for upgrading equipment may be effective in reducing injury. However, an evidence base is still needed for the vast majority of safety measures that safety manuals, consultants and safety courses routinely recommend. 
What was studied in the review? 
We looked at different types of workplace interventions, including the introduction of new regulations, safety campaigns, training, inspections, occupational health services, and company subsidies. We evaluated the quality of the studies and the effectiveness of interventions, rating the evidence as very low quality. 
What are the main results of the review? 
Introducing regulations alone may or may not be effective for preventing non‐fatal and fatal injuries in construction workers. Regionally oriented interventions such as a safety campaigns, training, inspections or occupational health services may not be effective for reducing non‐fatal injuries in construction workers. However, a multifaceted safety campaign and a multifaceted drug‐free workplace programme at the company level, along with subsidies for replacement of scaffoldings, may be effective in reducing non‐fatal injuries. 
Additional strategies are needed to increase the employers' and workers' adherence to the safety measures that are prescribed by regulation. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We searched for studies that had been published up to 1 April 2017.

## Plain Title
Testing Different Safety Methods to Prevent Injuries in Construction Workers

## Rationale

### What is the problem?
Construction workers get hurt on the job more than workers in most other types of jobs. These injuries can cause pain, time off work, and long-term health problems. This makes life harder for workers and their families.

### Why was this study needed?
Many groups suggest ways to keep construction workers safe. These include safety rules, training classes, and new equipment. However, we do not know which of these methods really work. We need to find out which safety methods actually reduce injuries.

### What did researchers want to learn?
Researchers wanted to find out which safety methods work best. They wanted to know if things like new rules, safety training, or better equipment really help prevent injuries. This information could help keep construction workers safer.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was not a single study. Instead, researchers looked at many different studies done by other scientists. They searched for all studies about construction worker safety. They found 17 studies to include in their review.

### Who was studied?
The studies looked at construction workers. These workers do many different jobs on building sites. The studies looked at workers in different countries and different types of construction work.

### What did researchers examine?
Researchers looked at different safety methods. These included:
- New safety rules and laws
- Safety training programs
- Safety campaigns and posters
- Workplace inspections
- Health services at work sites
- Money to help companies buy safer equipment

### How long did the review cover?
Researchers looked at studies published up to April 2017. This means they reviewed many years of research on construction safety.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

**New rules alone may not work well**
Making new safety rules by itself may not prevent injuries. Workers and bosses need to actually follow the rules. Just having rules is not enough.

**Regional programs may not help**
Large programs that cover whole regions may not reduce injuries. These include:
- Safety campaigns with posters and messages
- Training programs
- Workplace inspections
- Health services

These methods by themselves did not clearly reduce injuries.

**Some company programs may work**
Programs that use many different methods together may help. These programs work better when they happen at individual companies. Examples that may reduce injuries include:
- Safety programs that use many methods at once
- Programs to keep drugs out of the workplace
- Money to help companies buy safer scaffolding

**Quality of evidence**
The researchers rated the quality of evidence as very low. This means we cannot be very sure about the results. More and better studies are needed.

### What do the results mean?
Most safety methods that experts recommend have not been proven to work. We need more research to know which methods really help. Companies and workers need more than just rules. They need programs that help them actually follow safety practices.

### What should happen next?
We need better ways to make sure workers and bosses follow safety rules. We also need more research on safety methods. This research should use better study designs. Only then can we know for sure which methods keep construction workers safe.

### Main conclusions
Some safety programs that use many methods together may reduce injuries. Helping companies buy safer equipment may also help. However, we still do not have good proof for most safety methods. Much more research is needed to protect construction workers from injuries.

10.1002-14651858.CD006297.pub2-abstract.txt,"Intermediate acting versus long acting insulin for type 1 diabetes mellitus
Diabetes mellitus type 1 is a chronic disease with short and long term complications. The treatment for this disease is insulin administration, with basal and bolus insulin preparations being its main stay. Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin had previously been considered the standard of care for basal insulin replacement in blood glucose lowering for people with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Over the years, newer and longer acting insulins with a more physiological action profile became available: insulin ultralente, and later insulin glargine and insulin detemir. Their theoretical advantages lead to the thought of a beneficial effect on glucose level and rate of complications, such as very low levels of glucose or long term complications. The aim of this review was to assess whether this theoretical advantage is translated into real‐life benefits, by comparing the effect of long acting insulins to intermediate acting insulins on diabetes control.  Twenty‐three studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria with a total of 3872 and 2915 participants in the intervention and in the control group, respectively. The methodological quality of all the studies was rated intermediate to low. Trials duration was no longer than one year. The level of glycosylated haemoglobin, a marker of diabetes control, was lower in the long acting insulin group, but the observed difference was of doubtful clinical significance. Longer acting insulins were superior mostly in their nocturnal effect, which resulted in a lower level of fasting glucose levels and fewer episodes of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. No data on long term complications were available.  The currently available data can not substantiate conclusions on the benefits and risks of long acting insulins, and long‐term data are of need.

## Plain Title
Comparing Two Types of Insulin for People with Type 1 Diabetes

## Rationale

Type 1 diabetes is a lifelong disease. People with this disease cannot make their own insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use sugar from food.

Without insulin, sugar builds up in the blood. This causes problems. High blood sugar can damage the heart, eyes, kidneys, and nerves over time. Low blood sugar can happen when too much insulin is given. This can make people feel dizzy, confused, or very sick.

People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day. They need two kinds of insulin. One kind works fast during meals. The other kind works slowly all day and night. This slow insulin is called basal insulin.

For many years, doctors used NPH insulin as the basal insulin. NPH stands for Neutral Protamine Hagedorn. This is an intermediate acting insulin. It works for a medium amount of time.

Scientists made new insulins that last longer. These include insulin ultralente, insulin glargine, and insulin detemir. These are called long acting insulins. They work more like the body's natural insulin.

Researchers wanted to know if these newer insulins work better than NPH insulin. They thought the longer acting insulins might control blood sugar better. They also thought these insulins might cause fewer problems.

This study looked at all the research comparing these two types of insulin. The goal was to see if long acting insulins really work better in real life.

## Trial Design

Researchers looked at 23 different studies. These studies included 3,872 people who took long acting insulin. They also included 2,915 people who took intermediate acting insulin.

All the people in these studies had type 1 diabetes. The studies included men and women of different ages.

Each study lasted less than one year. People in the studies took either long acting insulin or intermediate acting insulin. Doctors measured their blood sugar control.

The quality of these studies was rated as medium to low. This means the studies had some problems in how they were done.

## Results

The researchers found some differences between the two types of insulin.

People taking long acting insulin had slightly lower glycosylated hemoglobin levels. This is also called HbA1c. It shows how well blood sugar is controlled over time. However, the difference was very small. It may not matter much for patients.

Long acting insulins worked better at night. People taking these insulins had lower blood sugar when they woke up in the morning. This is called fasting glucose.

People taking long acting insulin had fewer episodes of very low blood sugar at night. Low blood sugar at night can be dangerous. It can happen while people are sleeping.

The studies did not look at long term problems from diabetes. These include damage to the heart, eyes, kidneys, or nerves. The studies were too short to see these problems.

The researchers concluded that more information is needed. The current studies cannot prove that long acting insulins are clearly better. Longer studies are needed to see if these insulins prevent serious problems over many years.

The main benefit of long acting insulin seems to be better control at night. This may help some people with type 1 diabetes. However, doctors and patients need more information to make the best choice."
10.1002-14651858.CD006487.pub2-abstract.txt,"Injectable local anaesthetic agents for preventing pain in participants requiring dental treatment 
Review question 
This review assessed the evidence for providing successful local anaesthesia that prevents pain during a dental procedure. Included studies compared injections of local anaesthetic to help people requiring dental treatment and to prevent painful sensations tested in an experimental way (such as using cold, a sharp probe, or an electric stimulus). 
Background 
An injection of local anaesthetic prevents a person from feeling pain. It is given in one specific area rather than in the whole body. Although pain during dental treatment can be successfully managed, it is a common fear of patients. 
Several different local anaesthetics are available to dentists, as well as a variety of ways to deliver them, to prevent pain. Factors that appear to influence success include increased difficulty in anaesthetizing teeth in the presence of inflammation, variable susceptibility of different teeth to local anaesthesia, different operative procedures performed on the tooth (for example, it appears easier to achieve successful anaesthesia for dental extractions than for root canal treatment), and various techniques and solutions used to give the local anaesthetic. 
We investigated whether injection of one local anaesthetic solution was more effective than another for preventing pain during dental treatment or during an experimental study, and whether this effect occurred quickly or lasted a sufficient length of time, if any unwanted effects occurred, and people’s experience of the dental procedures. Local adverse events might include pain during or after injection, or long‐lasting anaesthesia. Systemic effects due to the local anaesthetic solution can include allergic reactions and changes in heart rate and blood pressure. 
Study characteristics 
Two reviewers searched the literature to identify studies that compared different local anaesthetic solutions injected into people undergoing dental treatment or volunteers who had the same outcomes measured in experimental ways. Within every trial, each person was randomly assigned to receive one of the local anaesthetics under study. The search was up‐to‐date as of 31 January 2018. 
We found 123 trials with 19,223 male and female participants. These trials investigated pain experienced during dental treatment including surgery, extraction, periodontal (gum) treatment, tooth preparation, root canal treatment, anaesthesia of nerves within teeth (pulps) tested using an electric pulp tester or cold stimulant, and anaesthesia of soft tissues measured following pricking of gums or self‐reported by the participant. We pooled data from 68 studies (6615 participants). This resulted in eight outcomes when seven different local anaesthetic solutions were tested during dental treatment, two outcomes assessing pain during and after injection of local anaesthetic, and 47 outcomes tested with a pulp tester or by pricking of gums or self‐reported by participants. 
Key results 
The review suggests that of the 14 types of local anaesthetic tested, evidence to support the use of one over another is limited to the outcome of success (absence of pain), from three comparisons of local anaesthetic. Findings show that 4% articaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was superior to 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine in posterior teeth with inflamed pulps requiring root canal treatment. No difference between these solutions was seen when pain on injection was assessed, and although lidocaine resulted in less post‐injection pain, the difference was minimal. Researchers found that 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was superior to 3% prilocaine, 0.03 IU felypressin and 4% prilocaine plain for surgical procedures and surgical procedures/periodontal treatment, respectively. Speeds of onset were within clinically acceptable times, and durations were variable, making them suitable for different applications. Both of these latter outcomes were tested in experimental ways that may not reflect clinical findings. Unwanted effects were rare. Patients' experience of the procedures was not assessed owing to lack of data. 
Quality of the evidence 
From comparisons of local anaesthetics in this review, all appeared effective and safe with little difference between them. Available evidence ranged from moderate to very low in quality. Some studies fell short, in terms of quality, owing to small numbers of participants, unclear reporting of study methods, and reporting of data in a format that was not easy to combine with other data. Further research is required to clarify the effectiveness and safety of one local anaesthetic over another.

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Pain-Blocking Injections Used During Dental Treatment

## Rationale

**What is the condition being studied?**
Many people fear pain during dental treatment. Dentists use special injections called local anaesthetics to block pain in one area of the mouth. These injections stop people from feeling pain during dental work.

**Why was this study needed?**
Dentists have many different pain-blocking medicines to choose from. They also have different ways to give these injections. Researchers wanted to find out if some pain-blocking medicines work better than others.

Some things can make it harder to block pain. Teeth with swelling are harder to numb. Some teeth are easier to numb than others. Some dental work needs stronger pain blocking than other work. For example, pulling a tooth may need less pain blocking than root canal treatment.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Researchers wanted to know:
- Which pain-blocking injection works best
- How fast each medicine starts working
- How long each medicine lasts
- If any unwanted effects happen
- What patients think about their dental visit

Unwanted effects might include pain during the injection, pain after the injection, or numbness that lasts too long. Some people might have allergic reactions. Heart rate or blood pressure might change.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This review looked at 123 studies. These studies included 19,223 men and women. Each person in these studies was randomly given one type of pain-blocking injection.

**What did the studies test?**
The studies tested pain blocking during:
- Dental surgery
- Tooth pulling
- Gum treatment
- Tooth preparation
- Root canal treatment

Researchers also tested pain blocking in experimental ways:
- Using an electric tester on teeth
- Using cold on teeth
- Pricking the gums
- Asking people if they felt numb

**How long did the studies last?**
The review included studies published up to January 2018. Individual study lengths varied.

## Results

**What did researchers find?**
Researchers tested 14 types of pain-blocking medicines. They found limited evidence that one medicine works better than another. Here are the main findings:

**For teeth with swelling needing root canal treatment:**
A medicine called 4% articaine with epinephrine worked better than 2% lidocaine with epinephrine. These medicines caused similar pain during injection. Lidocaine caused slightly less pain after injection, but the difference was very small.

**For dental surgery:**
A medicine called 2% lidocaine with epinephrine worked better than 3% prilocaine with felypressin.

**For dental surgery and gum treatment:**
The 2% lidocaine with epinephrine also worked better than 4% prilocaine plain.

**How fast did the medicines work?**
All medicines started working within acceptable times for dental treatment.

**How long did the medicines last?**
Different medicines lasted different amounts of time. This makes them useful for different types of dental work.

**Were there unwanted effects?**
Unwanted effects were rare.

**What did patients think?**
Researchers could not answer this question. The studies did not collect enough information about patient experiences.

**What do these results mean?**
All the pain-blocking medicines tested appeared to work well and be safe. There was little difference between them. The quality of evidence ranged from moderate to very low. Some studies had small numbers of people. Some studies did not clearly explain their methods. Some studies reported results in ways that were hard to combine with other studies.

**What is needed next?**
More research is needed. Future studies should clearly show if one pain-blocking medicine works better than another. Studies should also show if these medicines are safe."
10.1002-14651858.CD006672.pub3-abstract.txt,"Perineal techniques during the second stage of labour for reducing perineal trauma
What is the issue? 
Vaginal births are often associated with some form of trauma to the genital tract, and tears that affect the anal sphincter or mucosa (third‐ and fourth‐degree tears) can cause serious problems. Perineal trauma can occur spontaneously or result from a surgical incision (episiotomy). Different perineal techniques are being used to slow down the birth of the baby's head, and allow the perineum to stretch slowly to prevent injury. Massage, warm compresses and different perineal management techniques are widely used by midwives and birth attendants. The objective of this updated review was to assess the effect of perineal techniques during the second stage of labour on the incidence of perineal trauma. This is an update of a review that was published in 2011. 
Why is this important? 
Trauma to the perineum can cause pain and other problems for women after the birth. The damage is described as first‐, second‐, third‐ and fourth‐degree tears – first‐degree tears being the least damage and fourth‐degree tears being the most. Third‐ and fourth‐degree tears, affect the anal sphincter or mucosa, thus causing the most problems. Reducing the use of episiotomies will reduce trauma to the perineum. Also, different perineal techniques are being used to slow down the birth of the baby's head. Massage, warm compresses and different perineal management techniques are widely used by midwives and birth attendants. It is important to know if these do indeed reduce trauma and pain for women. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for studies in September 2016. Twenty two trials were eligible for inclusion in this updated review but only twenty studies (involving 15,181 women), contributed results to the review. The participants in the studies were women without medical complications who were expecting a vaginal birth. The studies varied in their risk of bias, and the quality of the studies was very low to moderate. 
Hands off (or poised) compared to hands on  
Using 'hands off' the perineum resulted in fewer women having an episiotomy (low‐quality evidence), but made no difference to numbers of women with no tears (moderate‐quality evidence), first‐degree tears (low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (low‐quality evidence), or third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence). There were considerable unexplained differences in results between the four studies. None of the studies provided data on the number of tears requiring suturing. 
Warm compresses versus control (hands off or no warm compress)  
Fewer women in the warm‐compress group experienced third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (moderate‐quality evidence). A warm compress did not affect numbers of women with intact perineum (moderate‐quality evidence), tears requiring suturing (very low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), or episiotomies (low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether warm compresses increase or reduce the incidence of first‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence). 
Massage versus control (hands off or routine care)  
There were more women with an intact perineum in the perineal massage group (low‐quality evidence), and fewer women with third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (moderate‐quality evidence). Massage did not appear to make a difference to women with perineal trauma requiring suturing (very low‐quality evidence), first‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), or episiotomies (very low‐quality evidence). 
Ritgen's manoeuvre versus standard care  
One small study found that women who had Ritgen's manoeuvre had fewer first‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), but more second‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence). There was no difference between groups in terms of the number of third‐ or fourth‐degree tears, or episiotomies (both low‐quality evidence). 
What does this mean? 
We found that massage and warm compresses may reduce serious perineal trauma (third‐ and fourth‐degree tears). Hands‐off techniques may reduce the number of episiotomies but it was not clear that these techniques had a beneficial effect on other perineal trauma. There remains uncertainty about the value of other techniques to reduce damage to the perineum during childbirth. 
More research is necessary, to evaluate different perineal techniques and to answer questions about how to minimise perineal trauma. There is insufficient evidence on women's experiences and views (only one included study collected information on this). It is important for future research to ascertain whether these interventions are acceptable to women. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Ways to Protect the Area Between the Vagina and Anus During Childbirth

## Plain Title
Testing Different Methods to Reduce Tearing in the Area Between the Vagina and Anus During Vaginal Birth

## Rationale

### What is the condition?
When a woman gives birth through the vagina, the area between the vagina and anus (called the perineum) often tears or gets cut. Doctors rank these tears from first to fourth degree. First-degree tears are small and cause the least harm. Fourth-degree tears are the worst. Third- and fourth-degree tears go deep into the muscles that control bowel movements. These serious tears can cause long-term pain and problems.

### Why is this a burden?
Perineal tears can cause pain after birth. They may lead to other health problems. Sometimes doctors make a cut in this area on purpose. This cut is called an episiotomy. Women want to avoid both tears and cuts when possible.

### Why was this study needed?
Midwives and birth helpers use different methods during birth. Some use massage. Some use warm, wet cloths. Some use special hand positions. Researchers wanted to know if these methods really help prevent tears. They wanted to find out which methods work best to protect women during birth.

### What did researchers think would happen?
Researchers thought that certain gentle methods might help the perineum stretch slowly. This slow stretching might prevent serious tears during birth.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was a review study. Researchers looked at 20 different studies. These studies included 15,181 women in total. The researchers combined the results to see what works.

### Who was in the studies?
All the women in these studies were healthy. They were expecting to give birth through the vagina. They did not have medical problems that would make birth more difficult.

### What methods did researchers compare?
The studies tested four main methods:

1. **Hands off versus hands on**: Birth helpers either touched the perineum or kept their hands away during birth.

2. **Warm compresses**: Birth helpers used warm, wet cloths on the perineum. They compared this to no warm cloths.

3. **Massage**: Birth helpers massaged the perineum during birth. They compared this to no massage.

4. **Ritgen's maneuver**: This is a special hand position. Birth helpers compared this to regular care.

### How long did the studies last?
The studies only looked at what happened during birth and right after. They did not follow women for a long time.

## Results

### What were the main results?

**Hands off method:**
- Fewer women needed episiotomies (cuts).
- This method did not change how many women had tears of any degree.
- The studies showed very different results from each other.

**Warm compresses:**
- Fewer women had serious tears (third- or fourth-degree).
- About the same number of women had no tears at all.
- About the same number needed episiotomies.

**Massage:**
- More women had no tears at all.
- Fewer women had serious tears (third- or fourth-degree).
- About the same number needed episiotomies.

**Ritgen's maneuver:**
- Only one small study tested this method.
- Results were unclear and not reliable.

### How does this help patients?
Massage and warm compresses may help prevent the worst tears. These are simple methods that birth helpers can use easily. They may protect women from serious injury during birth.

### What do these results mean?
The hands-off method may reduce unnecessary cuts. However, it may not prevent tears. Massage and warm compresses show the most promise for preventing serious tears.

### What are the conclusions?
More research is needed. Scientists need to test these methods more carefully. They need to ask women which methods they prefer. Only one study asked women about their experiences. Future studies should include women's views and feelings about these methods.

The quality of evidence varied. Some findings were more certain than others. Doctors and midwives can consider using massage and warm compresses. But they should know that more research would help confirm these results."
10.1002-14651858.CD006682.pub6-abstract.txt,"Length of time needed for antibiotic treatment given directly into the blood stream to clear acute chest infections in people with cystic fibrosis 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about how long intravenous antibiotic treatment (antibiotics given directly into the blood stream) is needed to clear flare ups of chest symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis. 
Background 
Flare ups of symptoms (exacerbations) in people with cystic fibrosis are treated aggressively to prevent further damage to the lungs. This practice has led to better survival rates for people with cystic fibrosis in recent years. However, there are no clear guidelines on how long treatment with intravenous antibiotics should be to treat these flare ups. Different centres tend to use different treatment regimens. Most centres use 10 or 14 days, extending this to 21 days if there is no improvement in a person's symptoms. This is an update of previously published reviews. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 30 May 2019.
Study characteristics 
No completed studies have compared different lengths of treatment with intravenous antibiotics, but there is one study under way looking at this question. When the results are published, we plan to include the study in this review. 
Key results 
Further research is needed to find the best duration of treatment for exacerbations. A shorter duration of treatment may be better as these courses of treatment are easier for people to complete. They are also less expensive and cause fewer drug reactions than longer treatments. However, it is not clear if shorter treatment is enough to treat infections adequately. It is also not clear whether shorter treatment results in early recurrence or increased frequency of chest infections.

## Plain Title
How Long Should People with Cystic Fibrosis Receive Antibiotics Through a Vein for Lung Infections?

## Rationale

**What is cystic fibrosis and why does it matter?**

Cystic fibrosis is a disease that affects the lungs. People with this condition get lung infections that come back often. These infections cause flare-ups of chest symptoms. These flare-ups can damage the lungs over time.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors treat these flare-ups with strong antibiotics. They give these drugs through a needle into a vein. This is called intravenous treatment. Treating flare-ups quickly helps protect the lungs. This has helped people with cystic fibrosis live longer.

However, doctors do not agree on how long to give these antibiotics. Different hospitals use different treatment times. Some give antibiotics for 10 days. Others give them for 14 days. If symptoms do not get better, treatment may last 21 days.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to know the best length of time for antibiotic treatment. They wanted to find out if shorter treatment works as well as longer treatment.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked for other studies that compared different treatment lengths. They searched for studies that tested short treatment times against long treatment times.

They wanted to find studies with people of any age who have cystic fibrosis. These people would have lung infection flare-ups. The studies would give antibiotics through a vein for different lengths of time.

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers did not find any completed studies to review. They found one study that is still happening. When that study finishes, they will include it in their review.

The researchers last looked for studies on May 30, 2019.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

There were no completed studies to report results from. This means researchers still do not know the best length of treatment.

**What does this mean for patients?**

More research is needed to answer this important question. Finding the right treatment length matters for several reasons.

Shorter treatment might be better in some ways. It is easier for people to finish shorter treatment. Shorter treatment costs less money. It also causes fewer side effects from the drugs.

However, researchers do not know if shorter treatment works well enough. They do not know if it fully clears the infection. They also do not know if shorter treatment leads to infections coming back sooner. It is unclear if shorter treatment causes more frequent flare-ups.

**What happens next?**

Doctors need more information to make the best choice. The study that is under way may help answer these questions. Until then, doctors will keep using different treatment lengths based on their experience. They will watch each patient closely to see how they respond to treatment.

**Why is this important?**

Finding the right treatment length could help people with cystic fibrosis in many ways. It could make treatment easier to complete. It could reduce costs and side effects. Most importantly, it could help keep lungs as healthy as possible."
10.1002-14651858.CD006919.pub4-abstract.txt,"Gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) used as an adjuvant to gonadotrophins in assisted reproduction treatments 
Review question 
Researchers from the Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence about the most effective way of using gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) as part of controlled ovarian stimulation in women undergoing assisted reproduction technology (ART). 
Background 
GnRHa are given along with hormone injections that stimulate the ovaries, in an attempt to prevent spontaneous release of eggs prior to their planned surgical retrieval. GnRHa have been proven to improve pregnancy rates; however, various regimens are described in the literature. We conducted this review to identify the most effective regimens. 
Study characteristics 
We found 37 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 3872 women comparing the use of GnRHa in various protocols. Twenty of these RCTs (1643 women) compared a long protocol with a short protocol. The evidence is current to April 2015. 
Key results 
In comparisons of long GnRHa protocols (where GnRHa is given for at least 14 days prior to the start of ovarian stimulation) versus short GnRHa protocols (when the GnRHa is given at the start of stimulation) there was no conclusive evidence of a difference in live birth and ongoing pregnancy rates. However there was moderate quality evidence of higher clinical pregnancy rates in the long protocol groups. Our findings suggest that in a population in which 14% of women achieve live birth or ongoing pregnancy using a short protocol, between 13% and 23% will achieve live birth or ongoing pregnancy using a long protocol. 
None of the other analyses showed any evidence of a difference in birth or pregnancy outcomes between the protocols compared. There was insufficient evidence to make any conclusions regarding adverse effects. Further research is needed to determine which long protocol is most cost effective and acceptable to women. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low. The main limitations in the evidence were failure to report live birth or ongoing pregnancy, poor reporting of methods in the primary studies, and imprecise findings due to lack of data. Only 10 of the 37 included studies were conducted within the last 10 years.

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Ways to Use Hormone Drugs to Help Women Get Pregnant Through Fertility Treatment

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**
Some women need help to get pregnant. They use a treatment called assisted reproduction technology, or ART. This treatment helps eggs and sperm meet outside the body.

**What is the problem?**
During fertility treatment, doctors give women hormone shots. These shots help the ovaries make more eggs. But sometimes the body releases eggs too early, before doctors can collect them. This is a problem because doctors need to collect the eggs at the right time.

**What is the study drug?**
Doctors use a drug called GnRHa along with the hormone shots. GnRHa stops the body from releasing eggs too early. This drug has helped more women get pregnant. But doctors use GnRHa in different ways. No one knows which way works best.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors needed to know the best way to use GnRHa. This would help more women have babies through fertility treatment.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**
Researchers looked at 37 past studies. These studies tested different ways to use GnRHa. The studies included 3,872 women total.

The main comparison looked at two methods:
- Long protocol: Women take GnRHa for 14 days or more before starting hormone shots
- Short protocol: Women take GnRHa when they start hormone shots

**Who was in the studies?**
All the women were trying to get pregnant through fertility treatment. They needed help from doctors to have a baby.

**How long did the studies last?**
The researchers looked at studies done up to April 2015. Each woman stayed in her study until doctors knew if she got pregnant or had a baby.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers compared the long protocol to the short protocol. Here is what they found:

**Pregnancy rates:**
The long protocol helped more women get pregnant. Out of 100 women using the short protocol, 14 had a baby or ongoing pregnancy. Out of 100 women using the long protocol, between 13 and 23 had a baby or ongoing pregnancy.

**Other comparisons:**
The researchers also looked at other ways to use GnRHa. They found no clear difference between these other methods. More research is needed.

**Side effects:**
The studies did not give enough information about side effects. Researchers could not tell which method was safer.

**What does this mean?**

The long protocol may help more women get pregnant than the short protocol. But the difference is not very large. Doctors need more information to know which method is best.

**What is still unknown?**

Researchers need to learn:
- Which long protocol costs less money
- Which method women prefer
- Which method is safest

**Quality of the findings:**

The quality of evidence was moderate to low. This means we cannot be completely sure about the results. Here are the problems:

- Many studies did not report if women had babies
- Many studies did not explain their methods well
- There was not enough data to be certain
- Most studies were old (only 10 out of 37 were done in the last 10 years)

**Conclusion:**

The long protocol may work better than the short protocol for helping women get pregnant through fertility treatment. But more research is needed to know the best and safest way to use GnRHa."
10.1002-14651858.CD007077.pub4-abstract.txt,"Partial breast irradiation for early breast cancer
What is the issue? 
Breast cancer is the most common cancer that women get.
Women with early breast cancer who choose to keep their breast need to have radiotherapy (RT) as well as surgery to remove the cancer to make sure it does not regrow in the breast. RT is treatment with high energy x‐rays. Having RT for breast cancer usually means 15 to 30 visits to the RT department, five times per week. 
If breast cancer does regrow in the same breast (called local recurrence), it tends to come back in the area it was removed from. Women can also grow a new cancer (new 'elsewhere primary') in another part of the same breast. We are not sure if the RT given to stop cancer regrowth where the first cancer was, stops the growth of 'elsewhere primaries.' 
Why does it matter? 
We always want to treat the smallest area we can with RT because this means fewer side effects. Treating only part of the breast could mean that RT might be able to be used again in another part of the same breast if needed. New ways of giving RT mean that treating part of the breast can be done with fewer treatments. This is likely to be easier for women and cost less money. 
What did we compare? 
We asked if giving RT to part of the breast (called partial breast irradiation (PBI)) is as good as giving RT to the whole breast. PBI can be given with a shortened treatment duration (called accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI)). 
For this treatment to be acceptable, it would need to control the cancer as well as giving RT to the whole breast does. It would also be important that the PBI gives about the same side effects and breast appearance as treating the whole breast. 
What did we find? 
We found nine studies, which involved 15,187 women. Our evidence is current to 27 August 2020. Local recurrence is probably slightly more common with APBI/PBI (moderate‐quality evidence) and the breast appearance (scored by doctors and nurses) was probably worse with APBI/PBI (moderate‐quality evidence). There is probably little difference in survival (high‐quality evidence). Late radiation fibrosis (change in breast appearance and feel) is probably increased with APBI/PBI. There are probably few differences in breast cancer‐related deaths and spread of breast cancer around the body with the use of APBI/PBI. The use of APBI/PBI makes little difference to how many women need mastectomy (removal of the whole breast) because of unacceptable late side effects or local recurrence. 
What do our findings mean? 
This means that at the moment, PBI does not give the same cancer control in the breast as treating the whole breast, but the difference is small. It may cause worse side effects. There are seven big ongoing studies that will be important to answer this question. We hope to have a clearer answer in the next update of this review. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Partial Breast Irradiation for Early Breast Cancer

## Plain Title

Comparing radiation treatment to part of the breast versus the whole breast in women with early breast cancer

## Rationale

**What is breast cancer and why does it matter?**

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. When women have early breast cancer and want to keep their breast, they need two treatments. First, doctors remove the cancer with surgery. Second, women need radiation therapy, or RT for short. RT uses strong x-rays to kill any cancer cells that might be left behind.

**What is the problem?**

Regular RT treats the whole breast. This means women must visit the hospital 15 to 30 times over several weeks, five days each week. This takes a lot of time and can be hard for women.

When breast cancer comes back in the same breast, it usually grows back in the same spot where it was removed. It can also grow as a new cancer in a different part of the breast. Doctors are not sure if treating the whole breast stops these new cancers in other parts of the breast.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Doctors want to treat the smallest area possible with RT. This causes fewer side effects for women. If doctors only treat part of the breast, they could use RT again later if needed in another part. New methods let doctors treat just part of the breast with fewer visits. This would be easier for women and cost less money.

Researchers wanted to know if treating part of the breast works as well as treating the whole breast. They called this partial breast irradiation, or PBI for short. When done with fewer treatments, it is called APBI.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this?**

Researchers looked at nine studies. These studies included 15,187 women with early breast cancer. All women had surgery to remove their cancer and wanted to keep their breast.

The studies compared two groups of women:
- Some women got RT to their whole breast
- Other women got RT to only part of their breast (PBI or APBI)

Researchers looked at information collected up to August 27, 2020. They checked how well each treatment worked. They looked at whether cancer came back, how women survived, and what side effects happened.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found several important things:

**Cancer coming back:** Cancer came back in the breast slightly more often with PBI or APBI compared to whole breast treatment. The difference was small but noticeable.

**Survival:** About the same number of women survived with both treatments. There was little difference between the two groups.

**How the breast looked:** Doctors and nurses said the breast looked slightly worse after PBI or APBI compared to whole breast treatment.

**Side effects:** Women who got PBI or APBI had more breast changes. The breast felt different and looked different over time. This is called fibrosis.

**Deaths from breast cancer:** About the same number of women died from breast cancer with both treatments.

**Cancer spreading:** Cancer spread to other parts of the body about the same amount with both treatments.

**Removing the whole breast later:** About the same number of women needed their whole breast removed later because of side effects or cancer coming back.

**What does this mean?**

Right now, treating part of the breast does not control cancer quite as well as treating the whole breast. The difference is small. PBI may cause slightly worse side effects and breast appearance.

Seven large studies are still happening. These studies will help answer this question better. The next review will likely give a clearer answer about whether treating part of the breast is as good as treating the whole breast."

Previous research on animal and physiological models suggests that antioxidant supplements have beneficial effects that may prolong life. Some observational studies also suggest that antioxidant supplements may prolong life, whereas other observational studies demonstrate neutral or harmful effects. Our Cochrane review from 2008 demonstrated that antioxidant supplements seem to increase mortality. This review is now updated. 
The present systematic review included 78 randomised clinical trials. In total, 296,707 participants were randomised to antioxidant supplements (beta‐carotene, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium) versus placebo or no intervention. Twenty‐six trials included 215,900 healthy participants. Fifty‐two trials included 80,807 participants with various diseases in a stable phase (including gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, neurological, ocular, dermatological, rheumatoid, renal, endocrinological, or unspecified diseases). A total of 21,484 of 183,749 participants (11.7%) randomised to antioxidant supplements and 11,479 of 112,958 participants (10.2%) randomised to placebo or no intervention died. The trials appeared to have enough statistical similarity that they could be combined. When all of the trials were combined, antioxidants may or may not have increased mortality depending on which statistical combination method was employed; the analysis that is typically used when similarity is present demonstrated that antioxidant use did slightly increase mortality (that is, the patients consuming the antioxidants were 1.03 times as likely to die as were the controls). When analyses were done to identify factors that were associated with this finding, the two factors identified were better methodology to prevent bias from being a factor in the trial (trials with ‘low risk of bias’) and the use of vitamin A. In fact, when the trials with low risks of bias were considered separately, the increased mortality was even more pronounced (1.04 times as likely to die as were the controls). The potential damage from vitamin A disappeared when only the low risks of bias trials were considered. The increased risk of mortality was associated with beta‐carotene and possibly vitamin E and vitamin A, but was not associated with the use of vitamin C or selenium. The current evidence does not support the use of antioxidant supplements in the general population or in patients with various diseases. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Antioxidant Supplements and Their Effect on How Long People Live

## Plain Title
Do Antioxidant Vitamin Pills Help People Live Longer?

## Rationale

**What are antioxidants?**
Antioxidants are substances found in some vitamins and minerals. They include beta-carotene, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium. Many people take these as pills or supplements.

**Why did researchers think antioxidants might help?**
Studies in animals suggested that antioxidants might help people live longer. Some studies that watched people over time also suggested this might be true. However, other studies showed no benefit or even possible harm.

**Why was this study needed?**
An earlier review in 2008 found that antioxidant pills might actually increase the risk of death. Researchers needed to update this review with new information. They wanted to know if taking antioxidant supplements helps people live longer or if it might cause harm.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**
This was not a single study. Instead, researchers looked at 78 different studies that had already been done. This type of review is called a systematic review. It combines results from many studies to get a clearer answer.

**Who was in these studies?**
A total of 296,707 people took part in all the studies combined. Some people took antioxidant supplements. Other people took fake pills (called placebos) or took nothing extra.

The studies included two main groups of people:
- 26 studies included 215,900 healthy people
- 52 studies included 80,807 people with various health problems

The health problems included stomach and gut diseases, heart diseases, brain diseases, eye diseases, skin diseases, joint diseases, kidney diseases, and hormone-related diseases.

**What did people in the studies take?**
People took one or more of these antioxidants: beta-carotene, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, or selenium.

**How long did the studies last?**
The length of time varied across the different studies included in this review.

## Results

**What were the main results?**
Out of 183,749 people who took antioxidant supplements, 21,484 people died. That is about 12 out of every 100 people.

Out of 112,958 people who took placebo or nothing, 11,479 people died. That is about 10 out of every 100 people.

When researchers combined all the studies, they found that antioxidant supplements slightly increased the risk of death. People taking antioxidants were 1.03 times as likely to die compared to people not taking them.

**Which antioxidants caused the most concern?**
The increased risk of death was linked to:
- Beta-carotene
- Possibly vitamin E
- Possibly vitamin A

Vitamin C and selenium did not increase the risk of death.

**Were some studies better than others?**
Yes. Some studies were done more carefully to avoid errors. These are called ""low risk of bias"" studies. When researchers looked only at these better-quality studies, the increased risk of death was even higher. People were 1.04 times as likely to die.

**What do these results mean for patients?**
The results show that antioxidant supplements do not help people live longer. In fact, they may slightly increase the risk of death. This is true for both healthy people and people with various diseases.

**What are the main conclusions?**
Based on current evidence, doctors should not recommend antioxidant supplements to the general population. People with various diseases should also not take these supplements expecting to live longer. The evidence does not support using antioxidant pills for preventing death."
10.1002-14651858.CD007263.pub3-abstract.txt,"Dilute versus full‐strength formula in exclusively formula‐fed preterm or low birth weight infants 
Review questionIs dilute formula milk (e.g. half the strength at double the volume) better tolerated than full‐strength formula milk in the initial feeding of preterm babies for whom breast milk is not available?  
BackgroundBabies born preterm (at less than 37 weeks' gestation) or with a low birth weight (less than 2500 grams) have special feeding requirements. Expressed breast milk is preferred, but preterm babies are often fed with formula milk because breast milk is not always available. The provision of artificial feeds varies considerably in preterm babies and there is concern that introducing full‐strength formulas too early may lead to the retention of feed in the stomach, which is associated with feeding intolerance and necrotising enterocolitis, a severe bowel disorder. 
Study characteristicsThe evidence for this review is current as of 1 October 2018. We included three trials that compared dilute formula milk (half‐strength, double‐volume) with full‐strength formula milk. The trials involved 102 preterm or low birth weight infants; two were conducted in the USA and one in India. The trials were small (14, 38 and 50 infants, respectively) and conducted between 25 and 30 years ago. The quality of two trials was judged to be poor due to insufficient information being provided in the trial publications, but judged to be moderate in the third trial (of 38 infants). None of the trials assessed necrotising enterocolitis as an outcome. 
Key resultsInfants receiving dilute formula (half‐strength, double‐volume) experienced fewer episodes of feeding intolerance and achieved full energy intake earlier than infants receiving full‐strength formula (20 kcal/oz (~ 68 to 70 kcal/100 mL)). 
Feeding intoleranceTwo measures of feeding intolerance (abdominal distension and episodes of gastric residuals) were reported across the trials. Two trials (88 infants) provided data for abdominal distension and gastric residuals. Infants fed dilute formula experienced 19% (CI 16% to 23%) fewer episodes of abdominal distension (> 2 cm), equivalent to 0.67 episodes per infant in the half‐strength group compared to 0.83 episodes in the full‐strength group. It was not possible to combine data on gastric residuals but both trials reported fewer episodes of gastric residuals in the dilute formula group. The third trial (14 infants) only reported that there was no difference between the groups with respect to these two outcomes. 
Time to establish full enteral feedingIn two trials (88 infants) infants receiving dilute formula experienced a 22% (CI 16% to 28%) reduction in the number of days required to reach an adequate energy intake (420 joules/kilogram), equivalent to 8 days in the half‐strength group compared to 10.3 days in the full‐strength group. 
Certainty of evidenceIn exclusively formula‐fed preterm or low birth weight infants, low‐certainty evidence shows that diluted formula may lead to an important reduction in the time taken to attain adequate enteral fluid and energy requirements, without increasing indicators of feeding intolerance. The clinical importance of the reduction in episodes of feeding intolerance is unclear. These findings are based on three small, old trials that may be of less relevance to current practice. A lack of data on other important outcomes, such as the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis and weight gain, limits the usefulness of the studies. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Diluted Formula Milk Compared to Full-Strength Formula Milk for Premature Babies

## Plain Title
Does diluted formula milk work better than full-strength formula milk for feeding premature babies?

## Rationale

### What is the health condition?
Babies born too early (before 37 weeks) or born very small (less than 5.5 pounds) need special care when feeding. These babies have tiny stomachs and their bodies are still learning how to digest food properly.

### What problems can this cause?
When these babies cannot get breast milk, doctors feed them formula milk. However, feeding these tiny babies can be difficult. Sometimes the formula stays in their stomach too long. This can cause problems like a swollen belly and trouble digesting food. In serious cases, it can lead to a dangerous bowel disease.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors are not sure how to start feeding formula to premature babies. Some doctors give full-strength formula right away. Other doctors start with diluted formula (half the strength but twice the amount). This study looked at which method works better.

### What did researchers want to learn?
Researchers wanted to know if diluted formula helps tiny babies digest food better than full-strength formula. They thought diluted formula might be easier for small stomachs to handle.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked at three older studies. These studies compared two feeding methods in premature babies.

### Who was in the studies?
The studies included 102 babies total. All babies were born too early or were very small. The babies could not get breast milk. Two studies happened in the United States. One study happened in India.

### What did the babies receive?
Half the babies got diluted formula (half-strength, twice the volume). The other half got full-strength formula. Doctors watched both groups closely.

### How long did the studies last?
The studies were small. They had 14, 38, and 50 babies each. The studies happened 25 to 30 years ago.

## Results

### What did researchers find?

**Feeding problems:**
Babies who got diluted formula had fewer feeding problems. They had less belly swelling. They had less food staying in their stomachs. For every 100 babies, those getting diluted formula had 19 fewer episodes of belly swelling. This means about 67 episodes per 100 babies with diluted formula compared to 83 episodes with full-strength formula.

**Time to full feeding:**
Babies on diluted formula reached full feeding faster. They needed about 8 days to get enough food. Babies on full-strength formula needed about 10 days. This is a difference of about 2 days.

### What does this mean?
Diluted formula may help premature babies start eating better. These babies may have fewer stomach problems. They may reach full feeding sooner.

### What are the limits of these findings?
The studies were small and old. Doctors today use different methods than 25 years ago. The studies did not measure some important things. They did not track the serious bowel disease. They did not track weight gain. The quality of information was not very good in two studies.

### What do researchers conclude?
Diluted formula might help premature babies who cannot get breast milk. It may cause fewer feeding problems. It may help babies reach full feeding faster. However, more research is needed. Newer and larger studies would help doctors know the best way to feed these tiny babies.

10.1002-14651858.CD007287.pub4-abstract.txt,"Antigen‐specific active immunotherapy for ovarian cancer
Background  Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynaecological cancers. Standard therapy consists of surgery and chemotherapy. Responses to chemotherapy are generally good; however, most women experience relapse, for which no curative treatment is available. The presence of certain immune cells in tumours is associated with longer survival. This suggests that stimulation of anti‐tumour immune responses (i.e. immunotherapy) might be a useful approach for improving outcomes among women with ovarian cancer. 
Review question This review evaluated the feasibility of antigen‐specific active immunotherapy. Antigen‐specific active immunotherapy aims to induce anti‐tumour immune responses through administration of a tumour antigen ‐ a molecule that is expressed by tumour cells and is hardly expressed by healthy cells. Reviewers collected information on clinical outcomes, immunological responses, and side effects. 
Main findings We identified 67 studies, which included 3632 women with ovarian cancer and were published between 1966 and 2017. The most frequently described strategy was administration of antibodies targeting the tumour antigen CA‐125 (2347 participants in 17 studies). Most of these studies primarily evaluated safety and immunological responses. Severe flu‐like and gastrointestinal symptoms occurred in 7% to 30% of participants. Researchers frequently detected antibodies and immune cells recognising the tumour antigen CA‐125, albeit response rates varied between studies. Despite these promising immunological responses, four large studies reported no survival advantage for participants treated with CA‐125‐directed antibody over those given placebo. 
For strategies not relying on antibody administration, similar conclusions cannot yet be drawn. Overall, study authors report that treatment was well tolerated and inflammatory side effects at the injection site were most frequently observed. Researchers observed responses of the immune system for most strategies studied, but the clinical benefit of these strategies remains to be evaluated in large trials. 
Certainty of the evidence and conclusions Because no high‐certainty evidence of clinical benefit is currently available, antibody therapy targeting CA‐125 should not be incorporated into standard treatment in its current form. 
Based on lack of uniformity in included studies, we strongly advocate universal adoption of response definitions, guidelines for adverse events reporting, and directives for trial conduct and reporting. Furthermore, results from ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are awaited, and further RCTs should be conducted. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing Immune-Based Treatments for Ovarian Cancer

## Plain Title
Can treatments that boost the immune system help women with ovarian cancer live longer?

## Rationale

Ovarian cancer is a serious disease that affects the ovaries. It causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive organs.

Doctors usually treat ovarian cancer with surgery and chemotherapy. These treatments often work well at first. But the cancer comes back in most women. When this happens, doctors cannot cure it.

Scientists have noticed something important. Women whose tumors contain certain immune cells tend to live longer. The immune system is the body's natural defense against disease. This finding suggests a new treatment approach. If doctors could help the immune system fight cancer cells, it might help women live longer.

Researchers wanted to test a special type of immune treatment. This treatment uses tumor antigens. These are molecules found mostly on cancer cells but not on healthy cells. The treatment aims to train the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells.

This study was needed to find out if this approach is safe. Researchers also wanted to know if it helps the immune system fight cancer. Most importantly, they wanted to see if it helps women with ovarian cancer live longer.

## Trial Design

Researchers looked at 67 different studies. These studies included 3,632 women with ovarian cancer. The studies were done between 1966 and 2017.

The studies tested different types of immune treatments. The most common treatment used antibodies. Antibodies are proteins that can attach to specific targets. In these studies, the antibodies targeted a molecule called CA-125. This molecule is found on ovarian cancer cells. A total of 2,347 women in 17 studies received this type of treatment.

Other studies tested different approaches. These did not use antibodies. Instead, they used vaccines or other methods to boost the immune system.

The studies included women of different ages with ovarian cancer. Some women had early-stage cancer. Others had cancer that had spread or come back after treatment.

The length of time women stayed in each study varied. This depended on the specific study design.

## Results

The researchers found important results about safety. Most women tolerated the treatments well. Some women had side effects. Between 7 and 30 out of every 100 women had severe flu-like symptoms. These included fever, chills, and body aches. Some women also had stomach problems like nausea or diarrhea.

For treatments that did not use antibodies, the most common side effect was redness and swelling where the injection was given.

The treatments did affect the immune system. Researchers found that the immune system made antibodies against CA-125. They also found immune cells that could recognize cancer cells. However, the strength of these responses varied between studies.

Despite these immune responses, the treatments did not help women live longer. Four large studies compared the CA-125 antibody treatment to placebo. A placebo is an inactive treatment. Women who received the antibody treatment did not live longer than women who received placebo.

For other types of immune treatments, researchers do not yet have enough information. More studies are needed to know if these treatments help women live longer.

The main conclusion is clear. Based on current evidence, doctors should not use CA-125 antibody treatment as a standard treatment for ovarian cancer. It does not help women live longer.

The researchers noted problems with how studies were done. Different studies measured results in different ways. This made it hard to compare studies. They recommend that all future studies use the same methods for measuring results and reporting side effects.

More research is needed. Some studies are still ongoing. Their results may provide more information in the future."
10.1002-14651858.CD007492.pub2-abstract.txt,"Healthcare services for adults with an intellectual disability
Background 
Adults with an intellectual disability often have difficulty in receiving the healthcare they need. Compared to other adults who do not have an intellectual disability, they have poorer health and have more difficulty finding, getting to, and paying for healthcare. This happens for both physical and mental healthcare needs. 
Review question 
We conducted a review of the literature to assess the effects of different ways to organise services. This is the first update of a previously published review. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for all relevant studies until 4 September 2015. We found seven studies, six of which we identified previously and one retrieved for this update. All of the studies assessed the impact of the intervention on the mental health of persons with an intellectual disability; none considered the physical health. Those studies used different interventions, including giving persons with an intellectual disability more health services, psychological support, and treating them at home, instead of at the hospital. Studies mainly looked at how the interventions helped the behavioural problems of those with an intellectual disability, how much burden they caused the care givers, and how much they cost. No study assessed adverse events. 
Key results 
Community‐based behaviour therapy might decrease behavioural problems. We are uncertain whether other interventions make any difference in reducing behavioural problems. There was limited evidence about how those interventions helped care givers to deal with the burden of caring for their relatives with an intellectual disability, or how much they might cost compared with the usual care already provided. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is little information on different ways to organise services for people with intellectual disabilities. Most studies focused on people who had intellectual disabilities and mental health problems. There were no studies on people who had intellectual disabilities and physical problems. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
How Different Ways of Organizing Healthcare Services Affect Adults with Intellectual Disabilities

## Rationale

**What is an intellectual disability and why is this important?**

Adults with intellectual disabilities often have trouble getting the healthcare they need. An intellectual disability means a person has challenges with thinking, learning, and problem-solving. These adults face more health problems than other adults. They also have a harder time finding doctors, getting to appointments, and paying for care. This affects both their body health and their mental health.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to find better ways to help these adults get healthcare. They looked at different ways to organize health services. The goal was to see which methods work best. This could help doctors and caregivers provide better support.

**What did researchers hope to find?**

The researchers wanted to know if changing how services are set up could improve health. They hoped to find ways that would help adults with intellectual disabilities get better care.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a single study. Instead, researchers looked at many studies done by other scientists. They searched for all studies published up to September 2015. This type of research is called a review. It brings together findings from different studies to see what works.

**Who was studied?**

The studies looked at adults with intellectual disabilities. All seven studies focused on mental health problems. None looked at physical health problems. The studies tested different ways to help these adults.

**What methods were tested?**

Different studies tried different approaches. Some gave people more health services. Some provided therapy to help with behavior problems. Some offered support from psychologists. Some treated people at home instead of at hospitals.

**What did researchers measure?**

Researchers looked at several things. They checked if behavior problems got better. They asked caregivers if their job felt easier or harder. They also looked at how much different services cost. No study looked at harmful effects or side effects.

## Results

**What were the main findings?**

One type of help showed promise. Behavior therapy provided in the community might reduce behavior problems. This means working with people in their homes or neighborhoods could help. However, researchers were not sure if other methods made a difference. The evidence was not strong enough to say for certain.

**What about caregivers?**

There was very little information about caregivers. The studies did not clearly show if the new methods made caring easier. Caregivers are often family members who help adults with intellectual disabilities. More research is needed to understand how different services affect them.

**What about costs?**

The studies provided limited information about costs. Researchers could not tell if new methods cost more or less than usual care. This information is important for planning services.

**What did the investigators conclude?**

There is not enough information about organizing services for adults with intellectual disabilities. Most studies only looked at mental health problems. No studies examined physical health problems. This is a big gap. Adults with intellectual disabilities often have both mental and physical health needs.

**Why does this matter?**

Better healthcare services could improve the lives of adults with intellectual disabilities. Right now, we do not know enough about what works best. More research is needed. Future studies should look at physical health, not just mental health. They should also study how services affect caregivers and how much they cost.

**What comes next?**

Healthcare providers need more guidance. Researchers should do more studies. These studies should test different ways to organize services. They should include both mental and physical health. This will help create better care for adults with intellectual disabilities."
10.1002-14651858.CD007565.pub2-abstract.txt,"Clear survival benefit is achieved if all or most (< 1 cm remaining) of the tumour after primary surgical treatment for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer is removed 
Ovarian cancer is a cancerous growth arising from different parts of the ovary. It is the sixth most common cancer among women. Most ovarian cancers are classified as epithelial. Ovarian epithelial cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissue covering the ovary and most cases are epithelial. Primary surgery is performed to achieve optimal cytoreduction (surgical efforts aiming at removing the bulk of the tumour) as the amount of tumour that remains after surgery (residual disease) is one of the most important factors that is taken into account when determining a prognosis (prognostic factor) for survival of epithelial ovarian cancer. Optimal cytoreductive surgery remains a subject of controversy to many practising obstetric gynaecologists who specialise in the diagnosis and treatment of women with cancer of the reproductive organs (gynae‐oncologists). The Gynaecologic Oncology Group (GOG) currently defines 'optimal' as having a small aggregation of remaining cancer cells after surgery (residual tumour nodules) each measuring 1 cm or less in maximum diameter, with complete cytoreduction (microscopic disease) being the ideal surgical outcome. Although the size of residual tumour masses after surgery has been shown to be an important prognostic factor for advanced ovarian cancer, there is limited evidence to support the conclusion that the surgical procedure is directly responsible for the superior outcome associated with less residual disease. This review assessed overall and progression‐free survival of optimal primary cytoreductive surgery for women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (stages III and IV). We found 11 retrospective studies that included more than 100 women and used a multivariate analysis (used statistical adjustment for important prognostic factors) and met our inclusion criteria. Analyses showed the prognostic importance of complete cytoreduction, where the residual disease is microscopic with no visible disease, as overall (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS) were significantly prolonged in these groups of women. PFS was not reported in all of the studies but was sufficiently documented to allow firm conclusions to be drawn. When we compared suboptimal (> 1 cm) versus optimal (< 1 cm) cytoreduction the survival estimates were attenuated but remained statistically significant in favour of the lower volume disease group, but there was no significant difference in OS and only a borderline difference in PFS when residual disease of > 2 cm and < 2 cm were compared. There was a high risk of bias due to the retrospective nature of these studies. Adverse events, quality of life (QoL) and cost‐effectiveness were not reported by treatment arm or to a satisfactory level in any of the studies. During primary surgery for advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer, all attempts should be made to achieve complete cytoreduction. When this is not achievable, the surgical goal should be optimal (< 1 cm) residual disease. Due to the high risk of bias in the current evidence, randomised controlled trials should be performed to determine whether it is the surgical intervention or patient‐related and disease‐related factors that are associated with the improved survival in these groups of women. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Surgery to Remove as Much Ovarian Cancer as Possible May Help Women Live Longer

## Rationale

**What is ovarian cancer?**
Ovarian cancer is a disease where cancer cells grow in the ovaries. The ovaries are part of a woman's reproductive system. This cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women. Most ovarian cancers start in the tissue that covers the ovary. Doctors call this type ""epithelial ovarian cancer.""

**Why is this condition a problem?**
Ovarian cancer is a serious disease. It can spread to other parts of the body. This makes it harder to treat. Women with this cancer need treatment to help them live longer and feel better.

**What is the main question this study tried to answer?**
Doctors perform surgery to remove as much cancer as possible. They call this ""cytoreductive surgery."" The study wanted to know if removing more cancer during surgery helps women live longer. Doctors wanted to find out how much cancer needs to be removed to give women the best chance.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors do not all agree on how much cancer should be removed during surgery. Some doctors think removing all visible cancer is best. Others think leaving small pieces (less than 1 cm) is good enough. This study looked at past research to find the answer. The amount of cancer left after surgery is very important. It helps doctors predict how long a woman might live.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers looked back at 11 older studies. They combined the results to find patterns. All studies looked at women who had surgery for advanced ovarian cancer. Advanced means the cancer had spread beyond the ovaries.

**Who was in these studies?**
The studies included women with stage III or stage IV epithelial ovarian cancer. Stage III and IV mean the cancer has spread. More than 100 women were in each study. The studies only included women, as ovarian cancer affects women.

**What did researchers compare?**
Researchers compared different groups of women. They looked at how much cancer was left after surgery. Some women had no visible cancer left. Some had small pieces less than 1 cm. Others had larger pieces more than 1 cm or more than 2 cm. Researchers then looked at how long these women lived.

## Results

**What did the study find?**
The study found that removing all visible cancer helps women live longer. Women with no visible cancer left after surgery lived the longest. They also went longer before their cancer came back.

Women with small pieces of cancer (less than 1 cm) also did better than women with larger pieces (more than 1 cm). However, when comparing pieces less than 2 cm to pieces more than 2 cm, the difference was much smaller.

**What does this mean for patients?**
During surgery, doctors should try to remove all visible cancer. This gives women the best chance to live longer. If doctors cannot remove all cancer, they should try to leave only very small pieces (less than 1 cm).

**What are the limitations?**
These studies looked back at past records. They did not follow a strict plan from the start. This means the results might not be completely accurate. The studies did not report side effects from surgery. They also did not report quality of life or costs.

**What do researchers conclude?**
Surgeons should work hard to remove all visible cancer during surgery. When this is not possible, they should aim to leave less than 1 cm of cancer. However, better studies are needed. Future studies should follow patients from the start. This will help doctors know if the surgery itself helps, or if other factors make a difference.

10.1002-14651858.CD007726.pub3-abstract.txt,"Stopping or continuing long‐term antipsychotic drug use for behavioural and psychological symptoms in older people with dementia 
Review question 
We investigated the effects of stopping antipsychotic drugs in older people with dementia who had been taking them for three months or longer. 
Background 
People with dementia may have symptoms and behavioural problems that can be distressing and difficult for carers to manage. Such symptoms (often described as neuropsychiatric symptoms, or NPS) include anxiety, apathy, depression, psychosis (hallucinations and delusions), wandering, repeating words or sounds, shouting, and behaving in agitated or aggressive ways, or both. 
Antipsychotic drugs are often prescribed with the aim of controlling these symptoms and behaviours, although most current guidance suggests these drugs should only be used for short periods of time for the most challenging behaviours. This is largely because these drugs are thought to have risks of side effects (including some that are serious), and because many behavioural problems improve without treatment. However, many people with dementia continue to take antipsychotic drugs over long periods of time. 
This review investigated whether it is feasible for older people with dementia and NPS to stop antipsychotic drugs which they have been taking for at least three months. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2013. 
Methods 
We searched up to 11 January 2018 for any study that randomly allocated some people with dementia who were taking antipsychotic drugs to continue this treatment and others to stop taking antipsychotic drugs. Study participants were followed up over a period of time to see what happened. 
Results 
We included 10 studies with a total of 632 participants in our review. We added one new study with 19 participants for this update. Most participants lived in nursing homes. The studies varied considerably with regard to the people they included, the methods they used and the outcomes they measured. 
Because the studies were so diverse, it was not possible to combine all the data numerically. We found low‐quality evidence that older people with dementia may be able to stop long‐term antipsychotics without their behavioural problems getting worse. However, in some people who had psychosis, agitation or aggression and who had improved significantly when they first started antipsychotic treatment, we found that stopping the drugs may increase the risk of the behavioural problems getting worse again. On the other hand, agitation decreased after stopping the drugs in some participants whose NPS at the beginning of the studies was relatively mild. 
We did not find enough evidence to know whether stopping antipsychotics has beneficial effects on quality of life, thinking and remembering, or the ability to carry out daily tasks, nor if the risk of harmful events ‐ such as falls ‐ is reduced. We are uncertain whether stopping antipsychotics leads to people living longer. 
Quality of the evidence 
Overall, evidence was low‐ or very low‐quality. This means we have limited or little confidence in the results, and that it is possible that other similar research could find something different. The main reasons for this assessment were that there were few studies that included few people, and a risk that results were not fully reported. All included studies had problems recruiting enough participants, making it more difficult for them to detect effects of stopping antipsychotics. 
Conclusions 
Limited evidence suggests that stopping long‐term antipsychotic drug use in older people with dementia and NPS may be done without making their behaviour worse. There may be benefits especially for those with milder NPS. There may be people with more severe symptoms who benefit from continuing treatment, but more research in people with both milder and more severe NPS is needed to be sure about this. The overall conclusions have not changed since the last version of this review and the number of included trials is still low. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Stopping Long-Term Antipsychotic Drugs in Older People with Dementia

## Plain Title
Can older people with dementia safely stop taking antipsychotic drugs they have used for a long time?

## Rationale

### What is the condition?
People with dementia often have behavior problems. They may feel anxious or sad. Some see or hear things that are not there. Others may wander, shout, or act in angry or upset ways. These problems can be hard for the person and their carers.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors often give antipsychotic drugs to control these behaviors. These drugs are meant to be used for short times only. They can cause serious side effects. Many behavior problems get better on their own without drugs. But many people with dementia keep taking these drugs for years.

### What did researchers want to learn?
Researchers wanted to know if it is safe to stop these drugs. They studied people who had taken antipsychotic drugs for at least three months. This review looked at studies from many years. It updates an earlier review from 2013.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers searched for studies up to January 2018. They found 10 studies with 632 people total. In these studies, some people kept taking their antipsychotic drugs. Other people stopped taking them. Researchers watched what happened to both groups over time.

### Who was in the studies?
Most people in the studies lived in nursing homes. All had dementia. All had been taking antipsychotic drugs for at least three months.

### How long did the studies last?
The studies followed people for different amounts of time. Each study tracked what happened after people stopped or continued their drugs.

## Results

### What did researchers find?
The studies were very different from each other. They looked at different types of people. They measured different things. This made it hard to combine all the results.

### Main findings about behavior:
Most people could stop their drugs safely. Their behavior problems did not get worse. Some people with mild behavior problems actually got better after stopping the drugs. Their agitation went down.

However, some people did worse after stopping. This happened mostly in people who had severe problems at first. These included seeing things that were not there or acting very aggressive. If the drugs had helped them a lot at first, stopping the drugs sometimes made their problems come back.

### Other findings:
Researchers could not tell if stopping the drugs helped with:
- Quality of life
- Thinking and memory
- Doing daily tasks like eating or dressing
- Preventing falls or other harmful events

Researchers were not sure if stopping the drugs helped people live longer.

### Quality of the evidence:
The evidence quality was low or very low. This means we cannot be very sure about the results. Future studies might find different results.

The main problems were:
- Not many studies were done
- The studies had few people in them
- Some results may not have been fully reported
- All studies had trouble finding enough people to join

### What do the results mean?
Most older people with dementia can probably stop long-term antipsychotic drugs safely. Their behavior will likely not get worse. People with mild behavior problems may even improve.

Some people with severe symptoms might need to keep taking the drugs. But more research is needed to know for sure.

### Final conclusions:
These findings are the same as the earlier 2013 review. More studies are still needed. Studies should include people with both mild and severe behavior problems. This will help doctors know who can safely stop these drugs and who should keep taking them."

What was the aim of this review? To compare treatment with and without anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor (anti‐VEGF) medications for people with neovascular glaucoma (NVG). 
Key message It is uncertain whether treatment with anti‐VEGF medications is more beneficial than treatment without anti‐VEGF medications for people with NVG. More research is needed to investigate the long‐term effect of anti‐VEGF medications compared with, or in addition to, conventional treatment. 
What did we study in this review? VEGF is a protein produced by cells in your body, and produces new blood vessels when needed. When cells produce too much VEGF, abnormal blood vessels can grow in the eye. NVG is a type of glaucoma where the angle between the iris (coloured part of the eye) and the cornea (transparent front part of the eye) is closed by new blood vessels growing in the eye, hence, the name 'neovascular'. New blood vessels can cause scarring and narrowing, which can eventually lead to complete closure of the angle. This results in increased eye pressure since the fluid in the eye cannot drain properly. In NVG, the eye is often red and painful, and the vision is abnormal. High pressure in the eye can lead to blindness. 
Anti‐VEGF medication is a type of medicine that blocks VEGF, therefore, slowing the growth of blood vessels. It is administered by injection into the eye. It can be used early stage, when conventional treatment may not be possible. Most studies report short‐term (generally four to six weeks) benefits of anti‐VEGF medication, but long‐term benefits are not clear. 
What were the main results of this review? We included four studies enrolling a total of 263 participants with NVG. In one study, results beyond the treatment period of 1 week could not be evaluated. In another study, results were uncertain due to the limitation of study design. 
The last two studies reported different results for lowering eye pressure; one study showed inconclusive results, and the other study showed that anti‐VEGF medications were more effective. The certainty of the evidence in these studies was low, due to limitations in the study designs and inconsistency of results. Therefore, available evidence is insufficient to recommend the routine use of anti‐VEGF medication in individuals with NVG. 
How up to date is the review? We searched for studies that were published up to 22 March 2019. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Anti-VEGF Medications for Neovascular Glaucoma

## Plain Title
Do Anti-VEGF Eye Injections Help Treat Neovascular Glaucoma?

## Rationale

**What is neovascular glaucoma?**

Your eye makes a protein called VEGF. This protein helps grow new blood vessels when your body needs them. Sometimes, your eye makes too much VEGF. This causes new blood vessels to grow where they should not.

Neovascular glaucoma is a type of eye disease. In this disease, new blood vessels grow in the wrong place. They grow in the angle of your eye. This angle is the space between the colored part of your eye and the clear front part. These new blood vessels block this space. They cause scars and make the space narrow. Over time, the space can close completely.

When this space closes, fluid cannot drain from your eye. The fluid builds up. This causes high pressure inside your eye. High pressure can damage your eye. Your eye may become red and painful. Your vision may get worse. If not treated, this can lead to blindness.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors wanted to know if a medicine called anti-VEGF could help. Anti-VEGF medicine blocks the VEGF protein. This slows down the growth of new blood vessels. Doctors give this medicine by injection into the eye.

Some studies showed that anti-VEGF medicine helps in the short term. This means it helps for four to six weeks. But doctors did not know if it helps over a long time. They wanted to compare treatment with anti-VEGF to treatment without it.

## Trial Design

**How was this review designed?**

Researchers looked at four different studies. These studies included 263 people total. All these people had neovascular glaucoma.

The researchers wanted to answer one main question. Does treatment with anti-VEGF medicine work better than treatment without it?

The studies looked at different groups of people. Some people got anti-VEGF medicine. Other people got different treatments. The researchers compared the results between these groups.

The studies lasted different amounts of time. One study only lasted one week. The other studies lasted longer. The researchers looked at studies published up to March 2019.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The results were unclear. The researchers could not say for certain if anti-VEGF medicine works better.

Here is what they found in each study:

One study only lasted one week. The researchers could not look at results after that week. This was too short to know if the medicine really helps.

Another study had problems with how it was set up. The results from this study were uncertain.

Two other studies looked at eye pressure. High eye pressure is a main problem in this disease. One study showed unclear results. The other study showed that anti-VEGF medicine worked better at lowering eye pressure.

**Why were the results uncertain?**

The studies had some problems. Some studies were not designed well. The results from different studies did not match. Because of these problems, the researchers rated the evidence as low quality.

**What does this mean?**

There is not enough good evidence to recommend anti-VEGF medicine for everyone with neovascular glaucoma. Doctors need more research. They need studies that last longer. They need studies that are designed better.

**What is needed next?**

More research is needed. Future studies should look at long-term effects. They should compare anti-VEGF medicine to standard treatments. They should also look at using anti-VEGF medicine along with other treatments.

Until better evidence is available, doctors cannot be sure if anti-VEGF medicine is the best choice for treating neovascular glaucoma.

Anthracyclines are anticancer drugs used in the treatment of different types of childhood cancer. An important adverse effect of anthracyclines is damage to the heart, which can lead to asymptomatic (without complaints) or symptomatic (with complaints) cardiac problems during and after cancer treatment. While there are several drugs available to treat other types of cardiac problems in adults, it is not known if these drugs are beneficial in treating cardiac problems caused by anthracyclines in childhood cancer patients and survivors. A physician confronted with a childhood cancer patient or survivor with anthracycline‐induced cardiac problems should be able to make an informed decision on how to treat this patient based on high‐quality evidence about the beneficial and adverse effects of the treatment options. We searched for and summarised studies that evaluated drugs for treating anthracycline‐induced cardiac problems in childhood cancer patients and survivors. 
We identified two randomised studies evaluating two different drugs in two different types of patients. One of these drugs, an angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril), had a short‐term beneficial effect on heart function in survivors of childhood cancer with asymptomatic cardiac problems caused by anthracyclines compared with placebo. However, the drug had no significant beneficial effect on other important outcomes and was associated with side effects such as dizziness and fatigue. This study was of reasonable/good quality. The other study was of low quality and found no effect of a short treatment with phosphocreatine in childhood leukaemia patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic cardiac problems compared with a control treatment with vitamin C, adenosine triphosphate, vitamin E, and oral coenzyme Q10. 
We could make no definitive conclusions about treatment options for anthracycline‐induced cardiac problems in childhood cancer patients and survivors. High‐quality studies are needed to determine if there are drugs that improve heart function in these patients.

## Plain Title
Testing Medicines to Treat Heart Damage from Cancer Drugs in Children

## Rationale

### What is the problem?
Some children get cancer. Doctors use strong drugs called anthracyclines to treat these cancers. These drugs work well against cancer. But they can hurt the heart.

The heart damage can happen during treatment. It can also happen years later. Some children have no symptoms. This means they feel fine but their heart is not working well. Other children have symptoms. This means they feel sick or tired.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors have medicines that help adults with other types of heart problems. But no one knows if these same medicines help children with heart damage from cancer drugs.

Doctors need to know which medicines work. They need to know which medicines are safe. This helps them make good choices when treating children.

### What did researchers want to find out?
Researchers wanted to find medicines that could help fix heart damage in children. They looked for studies that tested different medicines. They wanted to see if any medicines made the heart work better.

## Trial Design

### How did researchers find answers?
Researchers searched for studies that tested medicines in children. They looked for studies where some children got medicine and others did not. This type of study gives the best answers.

### Who was in the studies?
The researchers found only two studies. 

One study included childhood cancer survivors. These were people who had cancer as children. They were now older. Their hearts were damaged but they felt fine. They had no symptoms.

The other study included children with leukemia. Leukemia is a type of blood cancer. Some of these children had symptoms. Others did not.

### What medicines were tested?
The first study tested a medicine called enalapril. This medicine is called an ACE inhibitor. Researchers compared it to a fake pill called a placebo.

The second study tested a medicine called phosphocreatine. Researchers compared it to other vitamins and supplements.

### How long did the studies last?
Each study lasted a short time. The exact time varied by study.

## Results

### What did the studies find?

**First Study (Enalapril):**
This study was done well. It had good quality.

Enalapril helped the heart work better for a short time. This was in survivors who had no symptoms. The medicine worked better than the fake pill.

But the medicine did not help with other important things. Some people had side effects. They felt dizzy. They felt tired.

**Second Study (Phosphocreatine):**
This study was not done as well. It had low quality.

The medicine did not work better than the vitamins. It did not help the heart work better.

### What do these results mean?
The researchers could not make clear conclusions. Only two studies were found. One medicine helped a little bit. But it also caused side effects. The other medicine did not help.

More studies are needed. These studies need to be high quality. They need to include more children. They need to test for longer times.

### Why is this important?
Many children survive cancer today. But they may have heart problems later. Doctors need to know how to help them. Right now, there is not enough proof about which medicines work best.

Families and doctors should talk together. They should discuss the risks and benefits of any treatment. More research will help find better answers in the future.

10.1002-14651858.CD008215.pub3-abstract.txt,"Is there an increased risk of ovarian cancer in women treated with drugs for subfertility?
Background Drugs to stimulate ovulation have been used to treat subfertility since the early 1960s. There is uncertainty about the safety of these drugs and their potential risk of causing cancer. Moreover, it has already been shown that infertility itself increases the risk of ovarian cancer. 
The aim of the review We aimed with this updated systematic review to summarise current published research on the risk of ovarian cancer in subfertile women treated with fertility drugs compared to the general population and to subfertile women not treated with fertility drugs. 
What are the main findings? Overall, based on 37 studies, which included a total of 4,684,724 women, we did not find enough strong evidence suggesting a potentially higher risk of ovarian cancer in women treated with fertility drugs. 
A cumulative analysis of 12 case‐control studies from the USA revealed increased risk of ovarian cancer in women using fertility drugs, and this risk was higher in nulliparous women (women who have not given birth) when compared to multiparous women (women who have given birth to more than one child). One of the 37 included studies reported a two‐fold increase in development of serous borderline ovarian tumour in women after more than four cycles of progesterone; however the number of cases included in this group was very small. One cohort study also suggested an increased risk of borderline ovarian tumour in infertile women treated with clomiphene citrate when compared to infertile women who did not undergo treatment to conceive. 
Quality of the evidence Studies showing an increase in the risk of ovarian cancer were of low methodological quality, with short follow‐up periods and with lack of adjustment for important confounding factors; therefore the results are too unreliable. However, compared with older studies, recent studies have tended to report both the dose and the number of cycles of infertility drugs and have included more contemporary drug regimens; this has made the final results more reliable. 
What are the conclusions? Infertility has been found to be an important risk factor for ovarian cancer. However, the association between infertility drugs and ovarian cancer needs to be addressed with consideration of other factors such as age, body mass index, parity, genetic factors (i.e. family history for ovarian cancer), and aetiology of the infertility, along with longer follow‐up times.

## Plain Title
Do Fertility Drugs Increase the Risk of Ovarian Cancer in Women Being Treated for Infertility?

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**
Some women have trouble getting pregnant. This is called subfertility or infertility. Doctors have used special drugs to help these women get pregnant since the 1960s. These drugs help the body release eggs, which is called ovulation.

**Why is this important?**
Doctors are not sure if these fertility drugs are completely safe. Some research shows that women who cannot get pregnant easily may already have a higher chance of getting ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer is a serious disease that affects the ovaries, which are the organs that make eggs in a woman's body.

**What did researchers want to find out?**
Researchers wanted to know if fertility drugs make ovarian cancer more likely to happen. They compared women who took fertility drugs to women who did not take these drugs. They also looked at how these women compared to all women in general.

**Why was this study needed?**
Many women use fertility drugs to have babies. Doctors and patients need to know if these drugs are safe. This study looked at all the research done so far to give a clear answer.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was not a single study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at 37 different studies that had already been done. They combined all the information from these studies. This type of research is called a systematic review.

**Who was included?**
The 37 studies included a total of 4,684,724 women. All these women had trouble getting pregnant. Some of them took fertility drugs. Others did not take these drugs.

**What did researchers look at?**
Researchers looked at whether women who took fertility drugs got ovarian cancer more often than other women. They paid special attention to different types of fertility drugs and how many times women used them.

## Results

**What did the study find?**
The researchers did not find strong proof that fertility drugs cause ovarian cancer. Most of the evidence showed that these drugs are likely safe.

However, a few studies showed some concerns:
- Some studies from the USA found that women who used fertility drugs had a slightly higher risk of ovarian cancer.
- This risk was higher in women who never gave birth compared to women who had children.
- One study found that women who used a drug called progesterone more than four times had twice the risk of a certain type of ovarian tumor. But very few women were in this group.
- Another study found that women who took a drug called clomiphene citrate had a higher risk of borderline ovarian tumors.

**Why are these results not certain?**
Many of the studies that showed increased risk had problems. They did not follow women for long enough. They did not account for other important factors that affect cancer risk. These factors include age, weight, number of children, and family history of cancer. Because of these problems, the results are not reliable.

**What about newer studies?**
Newer studies were better than older ones. They kept better records of how much medicine women took and how many times they took it. This makes their results more trustworthy.

**What are the main conclusions?**
Being unable to get pregnant easily may itself increase the risk of ovarian cancer. The link between fertility drugs and ovarian cancer is still not clear. More research is needed that follows women for many years and looks at all the factors that affect cancer risk.

**Why does this matter?**
Women who need fertility drugs can feel more confident that these drugs are likely safe. However, doctors should continue to watch patients carefully and do more research over longer time periods."
10.1002-14651858.CD008288.pub2-abstract.txt,"Ayurvedic treatments for diabetes mellitus:
People with diabetes and other chronic diseases often use complementary and alternative medicines. This review examines the efficacy and safety of the use of various Ayurvedic treatments for diabetes mellitus. We found seven trials which included 354 participants (172 on treatment, 158 on control, 24 could not be classified). All these studies included adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Six studies tested five different types of herbal mixtures (proprietary drugs) and only one tested 'whole system' Ayurvedic treatment. The duration of treatment ranged from three to six months. One study each of Diabecon, Inolter and Cogent DB (proprietary herbal mixtures) found significantly lower glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) levels at the end of the treatment period compared to controls. Two studies of Diabecon, and one study of Cogent DB (proprietary herbal mixtures) found significantly lower fasting blood sugar levels at the end of the study period in the treatment group. No deaths were observed in these trials and side effects did not differ significantly between intervention and control groups. One study of Pancreas tonic reported no significant change in health‐related quality of life. No study reported on or was designed to investigate diabetic complications, death from any cause and costs. Despite positive results in some studies, and absence of serious side effects, firm conclusions cannot be drawn due to weak methods and small number of participants in the evaluated studies. Further research is needed to assess the efficacy of these treatments. Ayurvedic physicians generally use a mixture of various herbs or proprietary preparations along with diet, exercise and mode of living. The treatments are usually individualised taking into account the balance of three 'doshas'. It is possible that the interventions in the trials analysed have not replicated actual Ayurvedic practice but only assessed some components individually.

## Plain Title
Can Traditional Indian Medicine (Ayurveda) Help People with Diabetes?

## Rationale

**What is diabetes?**
Diabetes is a long-term health problem. It happens when the body cannot control blood sugar levels properly. High blood sugar can damage the body over time. It can harm the heart, eyes, kidneys, and nerves. People with diabetes must manage their condition every day. This can be hard and stressful.

**Why did researchers do this study?**
Many people with diabetes try different types of treatments. Some use traditional or natural medicines along with regular care. Ayurveda is an ancient healing system from India. It uses herbs, special diets, and lifestyle changes. Researchers wanted to know if Ayurvedic treatments can help people with diabetes. They wanted to see if these treatments are safe. They also wanted to know if they work to lower blood sugar.

**Why might Ayurvedic treatments help?**
Ayurvedic doctors believe health depends on balance in the body. They use mixtures of different herbs and plants. They also suggest changes to diet and daily habits. These treatments have been used for hundreds of years. Scientists wanted to test if they really work for diabetes.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was a review study. Researchers looked at seven different studies that had already been done. They combined the results to see what they could learn.

**Who was in these studies?**
All studies included adults with type 2 diabetes. Type 2 is the most common form of diabetes. A total of 354 people took part across all seven studies. About 172 people received Ayurvedic treatments. About 158 people were in control groups. Control groups received either fake treatments or standard care. This helps researchers compare results.

**What treatments were tested?**
Six studies tested herbal mixtures. These were special blends of different plants and herbs. The mixtures had names like Diabecon, Inolter, and Cogent DB. Only one study tested complete Ayurvedic treatment. Complete treatment includes herbs, diet advice, exercise, and lifestyle changes.

**How long did the studies last?**
People stayed in these studies for three to six months.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

Some studies showed positive results:
- Three studies found lower HbA1c levels in people taking herbal mixtures. HbA1c is a blood test. It shows average blood sugar over several months. Lower numbers are better.
- Three studies found lower fasting blood sugar in people taking herbal mixtures. Fasting blood sugar is measured in the morning before eating.

**Were the treatments safe?**
No one died in these studies. Side effects were similar in both treatment and control groups. This suggests the treatments were fairly safe.

**What about quality of life?**
One study looked at how people felt about their daily life. It found no major changes.

**What was missing?**
None of the studies looked at diabetes complications. These include heart disease, kidney damage, or eye problems. No studies looked at death rates from any cause. No studies looked at costs of treatment.

**What do these results mean?**
The results show some promise. Some herbal mixtures may help lower blood sugar. The treatments appeared safe in these short studies. However, researchers cannot make firm conclusions. The studies had problems. They were small. They did not use the best research methods.

**Important note:**
Most studies only tested herbal pills or mixtures. Real Ayurvedic practice is more complete. It includes personalized treatment plans. It considers each person's unique body type. It combines herbs with diet and lifestyle changes. The studies may not show how well true Ayurvedic practice works.

**What happens next?**
More research is needed. Future studies should be larger. They should use better methods. They should test complete Ayurvedic treatment, not just herbs alone. They should follow people for longer periods. This will help doctors know if Ayurvedic treatments truly help people with diabetes."
10.1002-14651858.CD008685.pub2-abstract.txt,"The optimal warfarin dose for patients beginning therapy
Warfarin is commonly prescribed to prevent blot clots in patients with medical conditions such as atrial fibrillation, heart valve replacement or previous blood clots. Warfarin is an effective treatment which has been used for many years but needs to be closely monitored, especially at the beginning of treatment, as there is a wide variation in response to dose. Monitoring of the response to dose is done using an International Normalized Ratio (INR) and it is important that patients remain within a narrow range (typically 2 to 3 INR) due to the need to balance the goal of preventing blood clots with the risk of causing excessive bleeding. 
This review included 12 randomised controlled trials comparing different warfarin doses given to patients beginning warfarin treatment. Most of the studies had a high risk of bias so the results were interpreted with caution. 
Those trials that were included compared loading doses in several different situations. The review authors divided the trials into four categories, 5 mg versus 10 mg initial doses (four studies), 5 mg versus other doses (two studies), 5 mg or 10 mg versus age adjusted doses (two studies), 5 mg or 10 mg versus genotype adjusted doses (four studies). 
The review authors concluded that there is still considerable uncertainty between the use of a 5 mg and a 10 mg loading dose for the initiation of warfarin. In the elderly, there is some evidence that lower initiation doses or age adjusted doses are more appropriate. However, there is insufficient evidence to warrant genotype adjusted dosing. We also found no data to suggest that any one method was safer than another.

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Starting Doses of Warfarin for People Beginning Blood Thinner Treatment

## Rationale

### What is the condition?
Some people need medicine to prevent blood clots. Blood clots can be dangerous. They can block blood flow in the body. People with certain heart problems need this medicine. This includes people with irregular heartbeats or artificial heart valves. People who had blood clots before also need this medicine.

### What is warfarin?
Warfarin is a medicine that prevents blood clots. Doctors have used it for many years. It works well. But each person responds to warfarin differently. Some people need more medicine. Some people need less. Doctors must watch patients closely when they start taking warfarin.

### Why is this study needed?
Doctors need to find the right dose for each patient. Too little warfarin may not prevent blood clots. Too much warfarin can cause bleeding problems. Doctors use a blood test called INR to check how warfarin is working. The INR number should stay between 2 and 3 for most patients. Finding the right starting dose is important. This study looked at different starting doses. The goal was to find which dose works best when people first start taking warfarin.

## Trial Design

### How is this study designed?
This was a review of other studies. The researchers looked at 12 different studies. All 12 studies compared different starting doses of warfarin. The studies included adults who were starting warfarin treatment. The studies had some problems with how they were done. So the researchers looked at the results very carefully.

### What doses were compared?
The researchers put the studies into four groups:
- Group 1: 5 mg compared to 10 mg (four studies)
- Group 2: 5 mg compared to other doses (two studies)
- Group 3: 5 mg or 10 mg compared to doses based on age (two studies)
- Group 4: 5 mg or 10 mg compared to doses based on genes (four studies)

Some studies looked at older patients. Some studies tested whether genes could help pick the right dose. Genes are instructions in our bodies that make us different from each other.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
The researchers could not say for sure which starting dose is best. There was not enough clear evidence. Both 5 mg and 10 mg starting doses might work. More research is needed to know which is better.

### What about older people?
For older people, lower starting doses may work better. Doses based on age may also be good for older people. Older people may be more sensitive to warfarin. They may need less medicine.

### What about using genes to pick a dose?
Some studies tested using gene information to pick the starting dose. The researchers found this did not help enough. There is not enough proof that gene testing makes warfarin safer or better.

### Was one dose safer than another?
The researchers found no proof that any starting dose was safer. None of the doses caused more bleeding or other problems. But the studies had limitations. More research is needed on safety.

### What does this mean?
Doctors still need to watch each patient carefully. They need to adjust the dose for each person. The starting dose is just the beginning. Blood tests will show if the dose needs to change. For most adults, either 5 mg or 10 mg can be used to start. For older adults, a lower dose may be better. Gene testing is not needed to pick a starting dose."
10.1002-14651858.CD008819.pub4-abstract.txt,"Wearing stockings to provide compression for the treatment of varicose veins
Review question 
What is the effectiveness of compression stockings as the only and initial treatment of varicose veins in people without healed or active venous ulceration (leg ulcers)? 
Background 
Varicose veins are widened veins that twist and turn and are visible under the skin of the legs. They generally do not cause medical problems, although many people seek medical advice. Symptoms may include pain, ankle swelling, tired legs, restless legs, night cramps, heaviness, itching and distress from their cosmetic appearance. Complications such as oedema (build‐up of fluid), pigmentation, inflammation (swelling, redness and pain) and ulceration (sores) can also develop. Compression stockings are often the first line of treatment and come in a variety of lengths from knee‐length to full tights, and apply different pressures to support the flow of blood in the veins. 
Study characteristics 
We included 13 studies involving 1021 participants with varicose veins who had not experienced venous ulceration in this review (search run May 2020). Five studies assessed compression stocking versus no compression stocking (for example no treatment or placebo stocking with no graduated elastic). Three of these studies used knee‐length stockings, one used full‐length stockings and one used full tights. Eight studies compared different types or pressures of knee‐length stockings. The stockings used in the studies exerted different levels of pressure. One study included only pregnant women, while other studies included people who had sought medical intervention for their varicose veins by being on surgical waiting lists, or attending vascular surgery or dermatology (skin care) clinics or outpatient departments. 
Key results 
Participants considered their symptoms had improved when stockings were worn in the nine studies that assessed this outcome, but these assessments were not always made by comparing one treatment group of the trial with a control group in the same study and was therefore subject to bias. 
Two studies comparing stockings with placebo stockings measured physical signs; there was no clear difference between baseline and follow‐up for ankle circumference, while oedema was reduced in the stocking group compared with the placebo stocking group. Generally there were no clear differences between studies comparing two types of stockings for volume reduction and change in diameter (ways to measure oedema). 
Complications or side effects ranged from sweating, itching, irritation, skin dryness and a feeling of tightness. There were no severe or long‐lasting side effects. 
Two studies comparing stockings with different stockings, and four studies comparing stockings with placebo/no treatment assessed compliance (whether the person used the stockings as directed). In the stocking versus different stocking studies, there was no clear difference between the stockings, with generally low levels of compliance reported. In the stocking versus placebo/no treatment group, three studies reported results. Of these, one study reported a high initial dropout rate with generally low levels of compliance. The other two studies reported generally good compliance in the stocking group. Some reasons provided for non‐compliance included discomfort, difficulty in putting the stockings on, appearance, not being effective and causing irritation. 
Four studies that compared stockings with different stockings and two studies that compared stockings with placebo/no treatment assessed comfort, tolerance and acceptability of stockings. Comparing stockings with placebo/no treatment, comfort, tolerance and acceptability was affected by the study population. Compression tights were increasingly rejected by pregnant women as their pregnancy progressed, while in a study of non‐pregnant women, the stockings group showed no more hindrance of normal activities and daytime discomfort when compared with placebo stockings. In the stocking versus different stockings studies, two studies reported similar levels of tolerance and discomfort between the types of stocking. Discomfort was the main reason for indicating a preference for one type of stocking over another. 
One study assessed quality of life, showing no clear differences between the stocking and no stocking groups. 
No conclusions regarding the optimum length or pressure of compression stockings could be made as there were no conclusive results from the included studies.  
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence was low or very low because of risk of bias due to poor reporting, not all studies assessed the same outcomes, they assessed them in different ways, or reported them in a way that they could be combined and analysed with other studies. Evidence from available trials is not sufficient to determine if compression stockings as the only and initial treatment are effective in managing and treating varicose veins in the early stages. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Compression Stockings for Varicose Veins

## Plain Title
Do compression stockings help treat varicose veins in people who have never had leg ulcers?

## Rationale

**What are varicose veins?**
Varicose veins are swollen, twisted veins. You can see them under the skin on your legs. They usually do not cause serious health problems. But they can cause symptoms that bother people.

**What problems do varicose veins cause?**
People with varicose veins may have pain, swollen ankles, or tired legs. They may have restless legs or leg cramps at night. Their legs may feel heavy or itchy. Some people feel upset about how their legs look. Sometimes varicose veins can lead to other problems. These include fluid buildup, skin color changes, swelling with redness and pain, or sores on the legs.

**What are compression stockings?**
Compression stockings are special tight stockings. They squeeze the legs gently. This helps blood flow better in the veins. The stockings come in different lengths. Some go up to the knee. Others cover the full leg. The stockings also squeeze with different amounts of pressure.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors often tell patients to try compression stockings first before other treatments. But researchers wanted to know if the stockings really work. They wanted to find out if stockings help reduce symptoms. They also wanted to know which type of stocking works best.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at 13 different studies. These studies included 1,021 people total. All the people had varicose veins. None of them had ever had leg sores or ulcers.

**What did the studies compare?**
Five studies compared wearing compression stockings to not wearing them. Some people wore no stockings at all. Others wore fake stockings that did not squeeze the legs. Eight studies compared different types of compression stockings. They looked at stockings with different pressures or lengths.

**Who was in the studies?**
Most studies included adults who wanted medical help for their varicose veins. Some were on waiting lists for surgery. Others went to vein doctors or skin doctors. One study included only pregnant women.

**How long did the studies last?**
The studies lasted different amounts of time. The information provided does not specify exact durations for all studies.

## Results

**Did the stockings help with symptoms?**
Nine studies asked people about their symptoms. People said their symptoms got better when they wore the stockings. However, these studies had some problems with how they measured results. This makes it hard to trust the findings completely.

**Did the stockings reduce swelling?**
Two studies measured ankle size and fluid buildup. The stockings helped reduce fluid buildup compared to fake stockings. But ankle size did not change much. Other studies comparing different types of stockings found no clear differences.

**Were there side effects?**
Some people had minor problems with the stockings. These included sweating, itching, irritation, and dry skin. Some people said the stockings felt too tight. No one had serious or long-lasting side effects.

**Did people wear the stockings as directed?**
Six studies checked if people wore their stockings regularly. Many people did not wear them as directed. Some people stopped wearing them completely. Reasons included discomfort and difficulty putting them on. Some people did not like how they looked. Others said the stockings did not help or caused irritation.

**Were the stockings comfortable?**
Six studies asked about comfort. Results were mixed. Pregnant women liked the stockings less as their pregnancy went on. Other women said the stockings did not interfere with daily activities. When comparing different types of stockings, comfort levels were similar. People preferred stockings that felt more comfortable.

**Did stockings improve quality of life?**
One study looked at quality of life. It found no clear difference between wearing stockings and not wearing them.

**What did the researchers conclude?**
The researchers could not make strong conclusions. The studies had too many problems. Different studies measured things in different ways. The evidence was not strong enough to say if compression stockings really work as the first treatment for varicose veins. More research is needed to find out which stockings work best and what pressure they should use."

At least 1 in 200 people have suffered a severe allergic reaction to a sting from a bee, wasp, or ant, and insect stings are the second most common cause of fatal allergic reactions in some countries. Treatment with insect venom, usually given by a course of injections (called venom immunotherapy), is thought to reduce the risk of allergic reactions to an insect sting. In this review, we evaluated the effectiveness of venom immunotherapy for preventing allergic reactions to insect stings. 
From analysis of 7 studies, which included 392 participants, we found that this treatment reduces the chance of having a serious allergic reaction to an insect sting by 90%, a consistent finding between studies. Venom immunotherapy also significantly improves the quality of life of people who have had a serious allergic reaction to an insect sting by reducing anxiety and possible limitation of activities caused by fear of insects. However, almost 1 in 10 people treated with venom immunotherapy during the trials had an allergic reaction to their treatment. We were unable to find out whether venom immunotherapy prevents fatal allergic reactions to insect stings, because these are so rare. The decision whether to start venom immunotherapy depends on an accurate diagnosis, followed by careful assessment of a person's risk of having another allergic reaction to a sting, the degree to which the insect sting allergy affects their quality of life, and the risk of an allergic reaction to their treatment. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Can Allergy Shots Help Prevent Serious Reactions to Insect Stings?

## Rationale

### What is the health problem?

Some people have severe allergic reactions when stung by bees, wasps, or ants. At least 1 in 200 people have had this problem. In some countries, insect stings are the second most common cause of deadly allergic reactions.

### Why is this a burden for patients?

People who have had a serious reaction to an insect sting often feel very anxious. They may worry about being stung again. This fear can stop them from doing outdoor activities they enjoy. Their quality of life goes down.

### What treatment was studied?

Doctors use a treatment called venom immunotherapy. This treatment uses small amounts of insect venom. The venom usually comes from the insect that caused the allergic reaction. Doctors give the venom through a series of shots over time.

### Why might this treatment work?

The shots help the body get used to the insect venom. Over time, the body learns not to react so strongly. This may prevent serious allergic reactions if the person gets stung again.

### Why was this study needed?

Researchers wanted to know if venom immunotherapy really works. They needed to find out how well it prevents allergic reactions. They also wanted to know if the treatment is safe.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?

This was a review of research studies. Researchers looked at 7 different studies. They combined the results to see what the studies showed overall.

### Who was in the studies?

A total of 392 people took part in the 7 studies. All of these people had experienced a serious allergic reaction to an insect sting before.

### How long did the studies last?

The review does not give exact time details. However, venom immunotherapy usually takes several months to complete. People get shots regularly during this time.

## Results

### What were the main results?

The treatment works very well. Venom immunotherapy reduces the chance of having a serious allergic reaction by 90%. This means 9 out of 10 serious reactions are prevented. All 7 studies showed similar results. This makes the finding very reliable.

### How did the treatment help patients?

The treatment greatly improved quality of life. People felt less anxious about being stung again. They worried less about insects. Many people felt more comfortable doing outdoor activities. They no longer had to limit what they did because of fear.

### Were there any problems with the treatment?

Almost 1 in 10 people had an allergic reaction to the treatment itself. This means the shots themselves can cause allergic reactions in some people. However, these reactions during treatment can usually be managed by doctors.

### What could the study not answer?

The researchers could not tell if the treatment prevents deaths from insect stings. Deaths from insect stings are very rare. The studies were not large enough to answer this question.

### What do the results mean?

Venom immunotherapy is very effective at preventing serious allergic reactions to insect stings. It also helps people feel better and live more normal lives.

### What should patients and doctors consider?

The decision to start this treatment needs careful thought. Doctors must first make sure the diagnosis is correct. They need to figure out how likely the person is to get stung again. They should consider how much the allergy affects the person's daily life. They must also think about the risk of reactions to the treatment itself. Each person's situation is different. Patients and doctors should discuss all these factors together."

People who suffer a heart attack (due to a blockage in the artery supplying blood to the heart) are usually affected by the damage to a portion of their heart muscle. Current treatment options are unable to restore the damaged section of the heart. Recently, stem cells have been shown to be able to restore and replace the damaged tissue in patients with heart attack. These cells could be mobilized to the heart with agents such as granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G‐CSF). 
In this review, analysis of seven included studies with low risk of bias using G‐CSF to improve the function of damaged heart of patient with heart attack failed to show any beneficial effects of this treatment. The rate of mortality was not different between the two groups (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.80, P = 0.55). Also, left ventricular parameters including left ventricular ejection fraction (RR 3.41, 95% CI ‐0.61 to 7.44, P = 0.1), end systolic volume (RR ‐1.35, 95% CI ‐4.68 to 1.99, P = 0.43) and end diastolic volume (RR ‐4.08, 95% CI ‐8.28 to 0.12, P = 0.06) did not show significant changes between the treatment and the control groups. There was no evidence that the study was associated with serious adverse effects, however it should be noted that the study was limited since the trials included lacked long enough follow up durations. Additionally four studies had either high or unclear risk of bias for blinding. Therefore, based on the results of the current study, G‐CSF treatment should not be administered for patients with heart attack.

## Plain Title
Does a Drug Called G-CSF Help Heal Heart Damage After a Heart Attack?

## Rationale

**What is a heart attack and why is it serious?**

A heart attack happens when blood flow to the heart gets blocked. This damages part of the heart muscle. The damaged part of the heart cannot work properly anymore. This can make patients feel weak and tired. It can affect their daily life.

**What treatments are available now?**

Current treatments cannot fix or replace the damaged heart muscle. Doctors need better ways to help the heart heal after a heart attack.

**What is the new treatment being studied?**

Scientists have found that special cells called stem cells might help repair damaged heart tissue. These stem cells can grow into new, healthy heart cells. A drug called G-CSF might help move these stem cells to the damaged heart. G-CSF stands for granulocyte colony stimulating factor. This drug is already used to treat other health problems.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if G-CSF could help heal heart damage after a heart attack. They hoped it would improve how well the heart works. This could help patients live longer and feel better.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at seven different studies that had already been done. They combined the results to see if G-CSF really works.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included patients who had suffered a heart attack. These patients had damage to their heart muscle. The studies included both men and women. The exact ages varied across the different studies.

**What did the studies compare?**

Some patients received G-CSF treatment. Other patients did not receive G-CSF. Researchers compared the two groups. They wanted to see if G-CSF made a difference.

**How long did the studies last?**

The length of time varied between studies. However, most studies did not follow patients for very long. This was a weakness of the research.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The studies showed that G-CSF did not help patients after a heart attack.

**Did G-CSF help patients live longer?**

No. The number of deaths was the same in both groups. Patients who got G-CSF did not live longer than patients who did not get it.

**Did G-CSF improve heart function?**

No. Researchers measured how well the heart pumped blood. They also measured the size of the heart chambers. G-CSF did not improve any of these measurements. The heart worked the same with or without G-CSF treatment.

**Was G-CSF safe?**

The studies did not find serious side effects from G-CSF. However, researchers could not be completely sure. The studies did not follow patients long enough to know about long-term safety.

**What problems did the studies have?**

Some studies had quality issues. In four studies, it was unclear if patients and doctors knew who got the real treatment. This could affect the results.

**What do these results mean?**

Based on these findings, doctors should not give G-CSF to heart attack patients. The treatment does not help the heart heal. It does not help patients live longer or feel better.

**What should happen next?**

More research may be needed with better study designs. Studies should follow patients for longer periods of time. This would give clearer answers about whether G-CSF could ever be helpful.

**Why is this study important?**

This review helps doctors know what treatments work and what treatments do not work. It prevents patients from receiving treatments that will not help them. It also helps researchers focus on finding better treatments for heart attack patients."
10.1002-14651858.CD009030.pub2-abstract.txt,"Splints and other non‐surgical methods for treating common injuries of the middle joints of the fingers 
Injury to the ligaments of the middle joint (proximal interphalangeal joint) of a finger may occur as a result of the finger being forced backwards. This is known as a hyperextension injury. Characteristically, this occurs in sporting accidents, such as where a football strikes an outstretched hand. These injuries are common and typically affect people of working age. Usually, these patients are treated without surgery using a combination of support (splinting/strapping to the adjacent finger) and exercise advice. Use of the hand is commonly encouraged but restricted to some degree by the severity of the injury. By examining the evidence from randomised controlled trials, this review aimed to assess which treatment for hyperextension injuries of the proximal interphalangeal joints of the fingers results in the best outcome for patients. The outcomes examined included function (including return to work), pain and joint movement. 
Three small studies including a total of 366 patients met the inclusion criteria for the review. The studies, which were all over 15 years old, were prone to bias. None of the studies reported any self assessment of function by participants. One study compared unrestricted mobility with immobilisation. One trial compared protected mobilisation (using a removable support in combination with exercise) with immobilisation. The remaining study compared immobilisation for one week versus three weeks. None of these trials found important differences between their intervention groups in various measures of poor outcome, pain and range of movement at six months follow‐up. 
We concluded that there was a lack of robust evidence to inform on the need for, and the extent and duration of, immobilisation for these injuries.

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Ways to Treat Finger Joint Injuries Without Surgery

## Rationale

### What is the condition?
The middle joint of your finger can get hurt when your finger bends too far backward. Doctors call this middle joint the PIP joint. This type of injury often happens during sports. For example, a ball might hit your hand when your fingers are stretched out. The injury damages the bands that hold the joint together.

### Who does this affect?
These injuries happen often. They usually affect people who are young enough to work. The injury can make it hard to use your hand. This can affect your job and daily life.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors usually treat these injuries without surgery. They use splints or tape the hurt finger to the finger next to it. They also give advice about exercises. But doctors were not sure which treatment works best. This study looked at past research to find out which treatment helps patients the most.

### What did researchers want to learn?
Researchers wanted to know which treatment gives the best results. They looked at how well the hand works after treatment. They also looked at pain levels and how much the joint can move.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at three older studies that had already been done. They combined the information from these studies. All three studies were more than 15 years old.

### Who was in the studies?
A total of 366 patients were in the three studies. All patients had injured the middle joint of a finger. The injury happened when the finger bent too far backward.

### What treatments did the studies compare?
The three studies looked at different treatments:
- One study compared letting the finger move freely versus keeping it still with a splint
- One study compared protected movement versus keeping the finger still. Protected movement means using a splint you can take off and doing exercises
- One study compared wearing a splint for one week versus three weeks

### How long did the studies last?
The studies followed patients for six months after their injury.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
The studies did not find major differences between the different treatments. After six months, patients had similar results whether they:
- Moved their finger freely or kept it still
- Used protected movement or kept it still
- Wore a splint for one week or three weeks

The researchers looked at several things:
- How well the hand worked
- How much pain patients had
- How much the joint could move

None of the treatments was clearly better than the others for these outcomes.

### What were the problems with these studies?
The studies had several problems:
- They were small studies with few patients
- They were old studies
- The way they were done could have led to mistakes
- None of the studies asked patients how well their hand was working. This is important information that was missing

### What do the results mean?
The researchers concluded that we do not have good evidence to answer important questions. We do not know for sure:
- If these injuries need to be kept still with a splint
- How much the finger should be kept still
- How long a splint should be worn

### Why does this matter?
Doctors need better research to know the best way to treat these common injuries. Future studies should be larger and better designed. They should ask patients about how their hand works in daily life. This will help doctors give the best care to people with finger injuries.

Review question 
Is cryotherapy (cooling) beneficial or harmful for local destruction of cancer (tumours) spread to the liver? 
Background 
When cancer spreads in the body (metastasis), one of the most common sites is the liver. Besides cancers of the liver (primary liver cancer), liver metastases from colorectal cancer are the most common cancer affecting the liver. More than half of people who have cancer spread to the liver die from complications. Cryotherapy is one of methods, used to destroy metastases in the liver. This method requires placing a special probe near the cancer site. The probe is used to deliver extreme cold to the site, which is produced by liquid nitrogen or argon gas. Placement of the probe can be guided using ultrasound or computed tomography (a special x‐ray). The rapid freezing process kills the cancer cells, and the size of the cancer is reduced. However, it is not clear if this treatment prolongs life or increases quality of life of affected people. 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of cryotherapy in destroying cancer metastases in the liver. We searched for studies assessing the effect of cryotherapy in comparison with no treatment or any other treatment in people with liver metastases from cancer of any location. We aimed to assess the effect of cryotherapy on the risk of death, quality of life, and adverse events (side effects caused by the treatment). 
Study characteristics 
We last searched for evidence in June 2018. We included only one trial conducted in Ukraine, and participants' primary cancer was colorectal (bowel) cancer in 66% of instances, but there were also people with stomach, breast, skin, and other tumours. All of them had cancer spread to the liver. In this trial, 123 participants were allocated at random to receive either cryotherapy (63 people) or conventional surgery (affected parts of the liver were removed; 60 people). 
Funding 
The trial did not provide information on funding.
Key results 
The trial was at high risk of bias. The participants were followed for up to 10 years (minimum five months). The trial reported that the mortality at 10 years was 81% (51/63) in the cryotherapy group and 92% (55/60) in the conventional surgery group. We judged the evidence as low‐certainty evidence. We found no evidence of a difference in proportion of participants with recurrence of the malignancy in the liver: 86% (54/63) of the participants in the cryotherapy group and 95% (57/60) of the participants in the conventional surgery group developed a new malignancy (low‐certainty evidence). The frequency of reported complications was similar between the cryotherapy group and the conventional surgery group, except for postoperative pain. Both insignificant and pronounced pain were reported to be more common in the cryotherapy group while intense pain was reported to be more common in the conventional surgery group. However, it was not reported whether there was any evidence of a difference. The frequency of unwanted effects (adverse events or complications) was mostly similar in both groups, but pain intensity and frequency seemed to differ between the groups. There were no intervention‐related mortality or bile leakages. The trial did not provide data on quality of life; cancer mortality, and time to progression of liver metastases. 
Reliability of the evidence 
The evidence for the effectiveness of cryotherapy versus conventional surgery in people with liver metastases is of low certainty. We are uncertain about our estimate and cannot determine whether cryotherapy compared with conventional surgery is beneficial or harmful. We found no evidence for the benefits or harms of cryotherapy compared with no intervention, or versus systemic treatments. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Cryotherapy for Cancer That Has Spread to the Liver

## Plain Title
Does freezing treatment help people with cancer that has spread to the liver?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

When cancer spreads from one part of the body to another, this is called metastasis. The liver is a common place for cancer to spread. More than half of people with cancer in their liver die from problems caused by the disease.

**What is cryotherapy?**

Cryotherapy is a treatment that uses extreme cold to kill cancer cells. Doctors place a special needle-like tool called a probe near the cancer. The probe delivers very cold temperatures using liquid nitrogen or argon gas. This freezing kills the cancer cells and makes the tumor smaller.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors are not sure if cryotherapy helps people live longer. They also do not know if it improves quality of life. This study looked at whether cryotherapy works better than other treatments for cancer that has spread to the liver.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers found one study done in Ukraine. The study included 123 people with cancer that had spread to their liver. Most people (66 out of 100) had bowel cancer first. Others had stomach, breast, skin, or other cancers.

The researchers divided people into two groups by chance:
- 63 people received cryotherapy (freezing treatment)
- 60 people had regular surgery (doctors removed the affected parts of the liver)

**How long did the study last?**

People were followed for up to 10 years. The shortest time anyone was followed was five months.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

After 10 years:
- 51 out of 63 people died in the cryotherapy group
- 55 out of 60 people died in the surgery group

The cancer came back in the liver for many people:
- 54 out of 63 people in the cryotherapy group
- 57 out of 60 people in the surgery group

**What about side effects?**

Both treatments caused similar numbers of problems. Pain was different between the two groups:
- Mild and moderate pain happened more often with cryotherapy
- Severe pain happened more often with regular surgery

No one died from the treatment itself. No one had bile leakage (a fluid that helps digest food).

**What did the study not tell us?**

The study did not report on:
- Quality of life
- How many people died specifically from cancer
- How fast the cancer grew in the liver

**What are the main conclusions?**

We cannot be sure if cryotherapy is better or worse than regular surgery. The evidence is weak because only one study was found. That study had problems with how it was done.

We found no studies comparing cryotherapy to:
- No treatment
- Chemotherapy or other drug treatments

**What does this mean?**

More and better studies are needed. Right now, we cannot say whether cryotherapy helps people with cancer that has spread to the liver. Doctors and patients should know that the evidence is limited and uncertain."
10.1002-14651858.CD009134.pub2-abstract.txt,"Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for acute respiratory failure following upper abdominal surgery 
Review question 
The goal of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) (continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel NPPV) compared with oxygen therapy alone in adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. 
Background 
Acute respiratory failure , where fluid builds up in the lungs stopping oxygen from crossing into the blood, is a relatively common complication after abdominal surgery and can increase the risk of dying (mortality). 
NPPV is a type of treatment that helps to improve breathing without having to insert a tube inside a person's windpipe (tracheal intubation). This intervention is effective in several illnesses. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases for clinical trials looking at the treatment of adults with acute respiratory failure following abdominal surgery. The trials compared NPPV with usual care(oxygen therapy through a face mask). We included two trials involving 269 participants.The participants were mostly men (67%) and on average 65 years of age. One trial was conducted in several intensive care units (ICU). Both trials included adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. The evidence is current to May 2015. 
Key results 
This review examined mortality, rate of tracheal intubation, length of stay in the ICU, length of hospital stay, complications after NPPV, and changes in the levels of gases within the blood (arterial blood gases). 
Compared with oxygen therapy, NPPV decreased the rate of tracheal intubation. Out of every 1000 adults who developed acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery, 181 adults treated with oxygen therapy would need to be intubated compared with 54 adults treated with NPPV. 
When compared to oxygen therapy, NPPV tended to reduce mortality. However, since the number of participants included in the two trials was small, more studies are needed. 
The use of NPPV also reduced the length of stay in the ICU by almost two days when compared to oxygen therapy. However, the mean length of stay in the hospital was similar in the two groups. 
When compared to oxygen therapy, NPPV improved blood gas levels one hour after the intervention. 
There was insufficient evidence to be certain that CPAP or NPPV had an effect on anastomotic (e.g. where two pieces of intestine are joined together) leakage, pneumonia related complications and sepsis (blood poisoning) or infections. However, adults treated with NPPV had lower rates these complications than adults treated with oxygen. 
Quality of the evidence 
There was low quality evidence for hospital mortality, low quality of evidence for rate of tracheal intubation, and very low quality of evidence for ICU length of stay. 
Authors' conclusions 
The findings of this review showed that NPPV is an effective and safe treatment for adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. However, due to the low quality of the evidence, more good quality studies are needed to confirm these findings.

## Plain Title
Using a Breathing Mask to Help People Who Have Trouble Breathing After Belly Surgery

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some people have trouble breathing after belly surgery. This is called acute respiratory failure. When this happens, fluid builds up in the lungs. The fluid stops oxygen from getting into the blood. This problem happens fairly often after belly surgery. It can be dangerous and may increase the chance of dying.

**What is the treatment being studied?**

Doctors wanted to test a treatment called NPPV. NPPV stands for noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. This treatment uses a mask that fits over the face. The mask helps push air into the lungs. This makes breathing easier. The good thing about NPPV is that doctors do not need to put a tube down the throat. Putting a tube down the throat is called intubation.

**Why was this study needed?**

NPPV works well for other breathing problems. Researchers wanted to know if it would help people after belly surgery. They compared NPPV to the usual treatment. The usual treatment is giving oxygen through a face mask. The study looked at whether NPPV was better and safer than oxygen alone.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked for studies that tested NPPV in adults. They found two studies. These studies included 269 people total. Most of the people were men (67 out of every 100 people). The average age was 65 years old.

All people in the studies had breathing problems after upper belly surgery. Upper belly surgery means surgery on the upper part of the stomach area. Some people got NPPV treatment. Other people got regular oxygen through a mask. The studies took place in hospitals. One study was done in several intensive care units. These are special hospital areas for very sick people.

The researchers searched for studies up to May 2015.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The study looked at several things. These included deaths, need for breathing tubes, time in the hospital, and side effects.

**Need for breathing tubes:**

NPPV worked better than oxygen alone. Out of 1,000 people with breathing problems after surgery, 181 people given oxygen would need a breathing tube. Only 54 people given NPPV would need a breathing tube. This means NPPV helped 127 more people avoid getting a tube down their throat.

**Deaths:**

NPPV seemed to reduce deaths. But the studies were small. More research is needed to be sure about this finding.

**Time in intensive care:**

People who got NPPV spent less time in intensive care. They left almost two days earlier than people who got oxygen alone. However, the total time in the hospital was about the same for both groups.

**Oxygen levels in blood:**

NPPV improved oxygen levels in the blood. This improvement happened within one hour of starting treatment.

**Side effects:**

The studies did not have enough information about some side effects. These included leaking where the intestines were sewn together, lung infections, and blood infections. However, people who got NPPV seemed to have fewer of these problems than people who got oxygen alone.

**What do these results mean?**

NPPV appears to be a good and safe treatment. It helps people who have breathing problems after upper belly surgery. It works better than oxygen alone. However, the quality of the evidence was low or very low. This means researchers need to do more good quality studies. These studies would help confirm that NPPV really works well for this problem."

What was the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether racecadotril works for children under five years of age with diarrhoea. Cochrane Review authors collected and analysed all relevant trials to answer this question and included seven trials in this review. 
Key messages 
Racecadotril may reduce the risk of rehydration failure. We are uncertain whether or not it influences number of bowel movements or duration of diarrhoea. 
What was studied in the review? 
Diarrhoea is a leading cause of death in children under five years old, especially in low‐income countries. Children who have diarrhoea often suffer from frequent and watery bowel movements, which might cause excessive loss of fluid and electrolytes (dehydration). Fluid replacement is recommended to prevent and treat dehydration caused by diarrhoea. Racecadotril has been used in addition to fluid replacement for treating diarrhoea in children, as it reduces release of water and electrolytes into the digestive tract. The drug is supposed to improve the symptoms of diarrhoea (shorten duration of diarrhoea or reduce the stool frequency) as well as reduce the risk of rehydration failure. However, it is not clear if racecadotril really works for children with diarrhoea. 
What are the main results? 
The review authors searched for available trials and included seven trials. The trials were conducted in a total of 1140 children aged from 3 months to 5 years. Children who were given racecadotril were compared to a control group (children who, instead of racecadotril, received a placebo (a dummy drug that contains no racecadotril) or no drug). The review shows that when children with diarrhoea were given racecadotril, compared to placebo or no drug: 
• racecadotril may reduce the risk of rehydration failure (low‐certainty evidence); • we are uncertain whether or not racecadotril shortens duration of diarrhoea (very low‐certainty evidence); • we are uncertain whether racecadotril influences the number of stools (very low‐certainty evidence); • racecadotril may reduce weight of stool output (low‐certainty evidence); • racecadotril may make little or no difference to length of hospital stay for inpatients (low‐certainty evidence); • racecadotril may make little or no difference to rates of side‐effect events (low‐certainty evidence) 
How up to date is this review? 
The review authors searched for trials published up to 4 March 2019.
","# Plain Language Summary: A Study on Racecadotril for Young Children with Diarrhea

## Plain Title
Does Racecadotril Help Treat Diarrhea in Children Under Five Years Old?

## Rationale

**What is diarrhea and why is it a problem?**

Diarrhea is when a child has loose, watery bowel movements. It is a major health problem for young children. In fact, diarrhea is one of the top causes of death in children under five years old. This is especially true in poor countries.

**What does diarrhea cause?**

When children have diarrhea, they lose too much water and important body salts. This loss is called dehydration. Dehydration can be very dangerous for young children.

**How is diarrhea usually treated?**

Doctors give children fluids to replace what they lose. This is called fluid replacement or rehydration. It helps prevent and treat dehydration.

**What is racecadotril?**

Racecadotril is a medicine. It works by stopping the gut from releasing too much water and salts. Doctors give it along with fluids to treat diarrhea.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if racecadotril really helps children with diarrhea. They wanted to see if it could:
- Make diarrhea go away faster
- Reduce how often children have bowel movements
- Help prevent treatment failure when giving fluids

No one was sure if this medicine truly worked for young children. This study looked at all the research to find the answer.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at seven different trials that tested racecadotril. They combined the results to see what works.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included 1,140 children total. These children were between 3 months and 5 years old. All of them had acute diarrhea.

**What did researchers compare?**

Some children got racecadotril along with fluids. Other children got either:
- A placebo (a fake pill with no medicine), or
- No extra medicine at all

Both groups received fluids for their diarrhea. Researchers then compared the two groups.

**How long did the studies last?**

The review looked at studies published up to March 2019. Each individual study lasted different amounts of time. The studies measured how long children stayed in the hospital and how long their diarrhea lasted.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The review showed mixed results about racecadotril:

**Benefits found:**
- Racecadotril may help prevent treatment failure. This means children may respond better to fluid treatment.
- The medicine may reduce the total amount of stool that children pass.

**Unclear benefits:**
- Researchers are not sure if racecadotril makes diarrhea go away faster.
- They are not sure if it reduces how many times children have bowel movements.

**No difference found:**
- Racecadotril probably does not change how long children stay in the hospital.
- The medicine does not seem to cause more side effects than placebo.

**Why are researchers uncertain about some results?**

The evidence quality was low or very low for most findings. This means the studies had problems or differences that made results unclear. More research is needed to be sure.

**What do these results mean?**

Racecadotril might help some children with diarrhea. It may work best at helping fluid treatment succeed. But it may not make diarrhea go away faster or reduce bowel movements. The medicine appears safe with few side effects.

**Main conclusions:**

Racecadotril shows some promise for treating diarrhea in young children. However, researchers need better studies to know for sure how well it works. For now, giving fluids remains the most important treatment for children with diarrhea."
10.1002-14651858.CD009379.pub3-abstract.txt,"Amniotic membrane transplantation for the treatment of ocular burns
How an ocular burn damages the eye 
The cornea is the transparent window of the eye that helps focus light to form an image of the outside world. For the cornea to remain transparent, it must have a healthy surface layer of epithelium, a stable tear film, and an absence of blood vessels. The epithelium is the moist cellular layer that covers the cornea, the white part of the eye, and the inside of the eyelids. The epithelium that covers the cornea is different from the epithelium of the conjunctiva. It is maintained in this state by a population of specialised stem cells found at the margin of the cornea (the limbus). In the normal eye, corneal epithelial cells slowly migrate from the limbus towards the centre of the cornea. 
A burn to the eye initially damages the surface epithelial layer, but it can also damage the deeper structures of the eye and the eyelids. A characteristic of an acute burn is an epithelial defect. This defect can fully recover after a minor burn. However, if the burn damages the stem cells of a segment of the limbus, the normal epithelium central to that area may not recover. The cornea is then covered by a functionally different type of epithelium derived from the peripheral conjunctiva, which may take weeks or months, and the cornea can become hazy and vascularised. In the absence of any epithelial covering, an additional risk is that the deeper tissues of the exposed cornea (stroma) may become progressively thinner and eventually perforate. The more extensive the damage to the limbus (measured in clock hours), the worse the outcome. The abnormal surface of the cornea, as well as haze and damage to structures within the eye (iris, lens, retina, optic nerve), can all lead to loss of vision. 
Treatments for ocular burns 
A burn to the surface of the eye is an emergency, and the eye must be washed immediately with water or saline to remove any chemical agents. The amount of damage to the epithelium (an epithelial defect) and the blood vessels at the edge of the cornea are measured, estimating the risk of future complications. The eye is then treated with medicines to reduce the risk of further complications and help the epithelial layer recover. Some doctors also use an amniotic tissue membrane placed over the surface of the eye. The amniotic membrane is the sac that surrounds a baby as it develops inside its mother. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to know whether using an amniotic membrane with medicines is better than just medicines. 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies in which an amniotic membrane was used to treat eyes that had been burned. We then looked for studies comparing eyes treated with medicines and an amniotic membrane patch with eyes treated using only medicines. We looked for randomised controlled trials, in which the treatment that people received was decided at random because these studies give the most reliable evidence about the effect of treatment. We assessed the treatment of moderate burns and severe burns separately, because they have different outcomes. We measured whether the treatment worked by comparing the proportion of eyes in which the epithelium over the cornea had failed to recover 21 days after the injury, visual function at the end of treatment, the presence of abnormal new blood vessels on the cornea, scarring between the cornea and the lids, the time taken for the epithelium to heal and adverse events in the intervention and control groups. We assessed the risk of bias in the randomised controlled study findings across pre‐specified domains. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to evaluate certainty of evidence include risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias.  
What we found 
We found two randomised controlled studies comparing the effect of medicines with the addition of an amniotic membrane patch inserted within seven days of the injury against medicines alone. One study suggested that treatment with amnion may be beneficial in moderate burns, but we found the certainty of the evidence to be low due to a high risk of bias and serious imprecision. For severe burns, there were no important differences between eyes that received an amniotic membrane and eyes that did not.  
Conclusions 
There is only uncertain evidence from randomised controlled studies of an important difference in healing between eyes treated with medicines and an amniotic membrane within seven days of an ocular burn and eyes that are treated only with medicines. Further research is needed to identify the best treatment for acute burns to the eye to reduce the risk of potentially devastating consequences and visual loss.

## Plain Title
Does using amniotic membrane tissue help eyes heal better after a burn injury?

## Rationale

**What happens when the eye gets burned?**

The cornea is the clear front part of the eye. It helps you see clearly. When a chemical or heat burns the eye, it can damage this clear surface. The outer layer of the cornea is called the epithelium. This layer is kept healthy by special stem cells at the edge of the cornea.

**What problems can eye burns cause?**

A minor burn may heal on its own. But a serious burn can kill these important stem cells. When this happens, the wrong type of cells may grow over the cornea. This can take weeks or months. The cornea may become cloudy. New blood vessels may grow where they should not be. In severe cases, the cornea can develop a hole. All of these problems can cause vision loss.

**How are eye burns treated?**

When someone burns their eye, doctors wash it right away with water. This removes harmful chemicals. Then doctors give medicines to help healing. Some doctors also place a special tissue patch on the eye. This patch is made from amniotic membrane. Amniotic membrane is the thin sac that holds a baby before birth.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Researchers wanted to know if using amniotic membrane works better than medicines alone. They wanted to find the best way to treat eye burns. Eye burns can cause serious vision problems. Finding better treatments is very important for patients.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

Researchers looked for studies that tested amniotic membrane treatment. They found two studies that compared two groups of patients:
- One group got medicines plus an amniotic membrane patch
- One group got only medicines

The studies used a method called randomized controlled trials. This means patients were put into groups by chance. This type of study gives the most reliable results.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included people who had burned their eyes. Some had moderate burns. Others had severe burns. Doctors placed the amniotic membrane patch within seven days after the burn happened.

**What did researchers measure?**

Researchers looked at several things:
- Did the outer layer of the eye heal within 21 days?
- How well could patients see at the end of treatment?
- Did new blood vessels grow on the cornea?
- Did scars form between the eyelid and cornea?
- How long did healing take?
- Did any side effects happen?

## Results

**What were the main results?**

For moderate burns, one study suggested that amniotic membrane might help. But the researchers were not very confident in this result. The study had some problems that made the results less reliable.

For severe burns, there was no important difference. Eyes treated with amniotic membrane healed about the same as eyes treated with medicines alone.

**What does this mean for patients?**

The evidence is uncertain. We cannot say for sure if amniotic membrane helps eyes heal better after a burn. The studies were small. They had some quality problems.

**What do researchers conclude?**

More research is needed. Scientists need to do better studies with more patients. This will help doctors find the best way to treat eye burns. Better treatments could prevent vision loss and help patients recover faster.

**How current is this information?**

Researchers last searched for studies in September 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD009481.pub2-abstract.txt,"Narrow‐band ultraviolet B phototherapy versus broad‐band ultraviolet B or psoralen ultraviolet A photochemotherapy for treating psoriasis 
Psoriasis is a common, chronic inflammatory skin disease, with an estimated global prevalence ranging from 0.5% to 4.6%. Based on clinical features, psoriasis is generally divided into the following: chronic plaque psoriasis (CPP); psoriasis associated with psoriatic arthritis; and pustular, erythrodermic, or guttate psoriasis. We also considered psoriasis affecting the palms and soles (palmoplantar psoriasis, or PPP). Although psoriasis is rarely life‐threatening, it can affect a person's quality of life significantly. 
Phototherapy is an essential treatment option for people with psoriasis. The most commonly used types of phototherapy are narrow‐band ultraviolet B (NB‐UVB), broad‐band ultraviolet B (BB‐UVB), and psoralen ultraviolet A photochemotherapy (PUVA). PUVA can be further divided into oral, bath, and topical PUVA according to the administrative route of psoralen. NB‐UVB delivers almost exclusively 311 nm radiation, whereas BB‐UVB can be divided into two types: selective BB‐UVB (305 to 325 nm radiation) and conventional BB‐UVB (280 to 320 nm radiation). 
This review included 13 small randomised controlled trials (RCT), with a total of 662 participants. Most of these were of poor methodological quality. 
For treating CPP, the clearance rate between the NB‐UVB and oral PUVA groups were inconsistent in three RCTs. In one, there was no difference between the groups, and in the other two, the clearance rate was in favour of oral PUVA. The evidence from the comparison of NB‐UVB with bath PUVA in terms of clearance rate was also inconsistent: Pooled data from two left‐right body comparison RCTs found no significant difference between the two groups, while another RCT favoured bath PUVA. 
Two RCTs found NB‐UVB plus retinoid (re‐NB‐UVB) and PUVA plus retinoid (re‐PUVA) had similar effects for treating people with CPP or guttate psoriasis. One RCT found no significant differences between NB‐UVB and selective BB‐UVB for clearing CPP or in the number of withdrawals due to side‐effects. 
In participants with PPP, one RCT found there were no statistically significant differences between NB‐UVB treated sides and topical PUVA treated sides in terms of clearance rate. 
In summary, NB‐UVB may be preferred to oral or bath PUVA because it is more convenient to use. NB‐UVB seemed to be equal to selective BB‐UVB for clearing CPP. Evidence regarding NB‐UVB and conventional BB‐UVB is limited. The long‐term safety of NB‐UVB needs to be confirmed. The efficacy of NB‐UVB for clearing PPP needs to be confirmed in future studies.

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Types of Light Therapy for Treating Psoriasis

## Rationale

**What is psoriasis?**
Psoriasis is a common, long-lasting skin disease. Between 1 in 200 and 1 in 20 people worldwide have psoriasis. The disease causes red, scaly patches on the skin. These patches can be itchy and painful.

**What types of psoriasis exist?**
There are several types of psoriasis. The most common type is chronic plaque psoriasis. This causes thick, raised patches on the skin. Other types include guttate psoriasis (small spots), pustular psoriasis (with pus-filled bumps), and psoriasis on the palms and soles of the feet. Some people also get joint pain with their psoriasis.

**Why is psoriasis a problem?**
Psoriasis rarely causes death. However, it can greatly affect how people feel about their lives. The visible skin patches can cause embarrassment. The itching and pain can make daily activities difficult.

**What is light therapy?**
Light therapy uses special lights to treat psoriasis. Doctors commonly use three main types. These are narrow-band UVB (NB-UVB), broad-band UVB (BB-UVB), and PUVA. PUVA combines a medicine called psoralen with UVA light. Patients can take psoralen by mouth, in a bath, or apply it to the skin.

**Why was this study needed?**
Researchers wanted to know which light therapy works best. They wanted to compare how well these treatments clear psoriasis. They also wanted to know which treatments are safest and easiest to use.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers reviewed 13 different studies. These studies included 662 people total. Each study was a randomized controlled trial. This means patients were randomly assigned to different treatment groups. This type of study helps researchers compare treatments fairly.

**Who was in these studies?**
The studies included adults and possibly children with psoriasis. Most had chronic plaque psoriasis. Some had other types like guttate psoriasis or palm and sole psoriasis.

**What did researchers compare?**
Researchers compared NB-UVB light therapy to other treatments. They looked at oral PUVA, bath PUVA, topical PUVA, and BB-UVB. Some studies also tested light therapy combined with a medicine called retinoid.

**How long did the studies last?**
The abstract does not state how long patients stayed in each study.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

For chronic plaque psoriasis, the results were mixed. Three studies compared NB-UVB to oral PUVA. One study found no difference between the two treatments. Two studies found oral PUVA worked better at clearing the skin.

Studies comparing NB-UVB to bath PUVA also had mixed results. Two studies found no major difference between the treatments. Another study found bath PUVA worked better.

Two studies looked at adding retinoid medicine to light therapy. They found NB-UVB plus retinoid worked as well as PUVA plus retinoid.

One study compared NB-UVB to selective BB-UVB. The study found both treatments cleared chronic plaque psoriasis equally well. Both had similar side effects.

For psoriasis on palms and soles, one study found no major difference. NB-UVB and topical PUVA cleared the skin about the same amount.

**What do these results mean?**

NB-UVB may be a better choice than oral or bath PUVA. This is because NB-UVB is easier to use. Patients do not need to take medicine or sit in a bath first.

NB-UVB seems to work as well as selective BB-UVB for chronic plaque psoriasis.

**What are the limitations?**

Most studies were small and not well designed. This makes the results less certain. Researchers need more studies to confirm these findings.

Researchers do not yet know if NB-UVB is safe over many years. More research is needed on long-term safety.

More studies are needed to test NB-UVB for palm and sole psoriasis.

**Conclusion**

NB-UVB light therapy may be a good treatment choice for psoriasis. It is convenient and seems to work as well as other light therapies. However, more high-quality studies are needed to confirm these findings."
10.1002-14651858.CD009487.pub3-abstract.txt,"Lateral pararectal versus transrectal stoma placement for prevention of parastomal herniation 
We asked 
Is there a difference in the rate of parastomal herniation, and other stoma‐related complications in people undergoing abdominal wall enterostomy, when comparing two stoma formation techniques: lateral pararectal, in which the stoma is located beside the rectus abdominis muscle, one of the muscles of the abdominal wall, versus transrectal, in which the stoma is pulled through the rectus abdominis muscle? 
Background 
A stoma is an opening in the abdomen, which is surgically created to divert the flow of urine or feces; an enterostomy is a stoma that starts in the bowel. A parastomal hernia is an incisional hernia, through which abdominal contents protrude through a defect in the abdominal wall at the site of previous surgery. It is related to a stoma, and is one of the most common stoma‐related complications. Many factors that potentially influence the occurrence of parastomal herniation have been investigated. However, it remains unclear whether the enterostomy should be placed through or beside the rectus abdominis muscle in order to prevent parastomal herniation. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to 9 November 2018. In this update, we included 10 retrospective cohort studies with a total of 864 participants, and one randomized controlled trial (RCT: a study in which participants are randomly allocated to the treatment groups), including 60 participants. The target population was individuals, regardless of age, who received a temporary or permanent enterostomy for any reason in either the elective (planned) or the emergency setting. 
Key results 
The results found inconclusive results between the two techniques for the risk of parastomal herniation (11 studies, 924 participants), stomal prolapse (1 study, 145 participants), ileus or stenosis (1 study, 60 participants), and skin irritation (1 study, 60 participants). 
Neither technique was found to be better than the other for any of the stoma‐related outcomes of interest. 
None of the studies measured other stoma‐related problems, or death.
Quality of the evidence 
We downgraded the quality of the evidence to moderate, low, or very low, because of high risk of bias, small sample sizes, few events, and diversity across studies. 
Conclusion 
Based on the current knowledge presented in this review, there is no evidence to support the use of one stoma formation technique over the other. Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Comparing Two Ways to Create a Stoma: Placing It Next to or Through the Belly Muscle

## Rationale

**What is a stoma and why do people need one?**

A stoma is an opening made in the belly during surgery. It lets waste from the bowel leave the body. Some people need a stoma when their bowel cannot work normally.

**What problems can happen with a stoma?**

One common problem is called a parastomal hernia. This happens when tissue or organs push through a weak spot in the belly wall near the stoma. A hernia can cause pain and other issues for patients.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors use two main ways to create a stoma. One way places the stoma next to a belly muscle called the rectus abdominis. The other way pulls the stoma through this muscle. Doctors were not sure which way works better to prevent hernias and other stoma problems.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

The researchers wanted to know if one method causes fewer hernias than the other. They also wanted to see if one method causes fewer other stoma problems.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at 11 different studies that had already been done. They combined the results to find patterns.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included 924 people total. These were people of any age who needed a stoma. Some needed the stoma for a short time. Others needed it permanently. Some had planned surgery. Others had emergency surgery.

**What did the studies compare?**

The studies compared two groups:
- One group had stomas placed next to the belly muscle (lateral pararectal method)
- The other group had stomas pulled through the belly muscle (transrectal method)

**How long did the studies last?**

The review looked at studies published up to November 2018. Each original study followed patients for different lengths of time.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers could not find clear proof that one method works better than the other.

**Hernias:** Both methods had similar rates of hernias near the stoma.

**Other problems:** The studies looked at other stoma issues like:
- Stomal prolapse (when the bowel pushes out too far)
- Blockage or narrowing of the stoma
- Skin irritation around the stoma

Neither method was clearly better for preventing these problems.

**What was not measured?**

The studies did not look at death rates. They also did not measure some other stoma problems.

**How good was the evidence?**

The quality of evidence was not very strong. The researchers rated it as moderate, low, or very low quality. This was because:
- The studies were small
- Not many problems happened in the studies
- The studies were done in different ways
- Some studies had design problems

**What do these results mean?**

Based on current knowledge, doctors cannot say one method is better than the other. Both ways of creating a stoma seem to work about the same.

**What happens next?**

More research is needed. Better studies could help doctors know which method to use. Future studies should include more patients. They should also follow patients for longer periods of time.

**Bottom line:** Right now, there is no clear winner between these two stoma creation methods. Doctors can use either method based on their training and the patient's needs."
10.1002-14651858.CD009567.pub2-abstract.txt,"Treatments for high altitude (mountain) illness
Background 
Acute high altitude illness, also known as acute mountain sickness, may present with a variety of symptoms. It is caused by the decreasing level of oxygen at increasingly high altitudes; and it can be experienced when reaching a high altitude when travelling, hiking or climbing mountains or other elevated areas. People going to altitudes over 4000 metres, females, people younger than mid‐adulthood , and people with a history of migraine are at greater risk of suffering from altitude sickness. The most common symptoms are headache, loss of appetite , insomnia, and nausea. However, severe forms can include confusion, difficulty walking, progressive cough, shortness of breath, and even death. 
Review question 
What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for people suffering from high altitude illness? 
Study characteristics 
We included 13 studies with a total of 468 participants. Most studies included participants with mild or moderate forms of mountain sickness, and only one study included the severe neurological (disorder of the nervous system) form. Follow‐up was usually less than one day. We also identified two ongoing studies. 
Key results 
We found studies evaluating the following interventions: simulated descent with a hyperbaric chamber (medical use of oxygen in a special chamber at greater than atmospheric pressure to increase the availability of oxygen in the body); oxygen; medicines: acetazolamide, dexamethasone, ibuprofen, paracetamol, gabapentin, sumatriptan, nitric oxide, and magnesium sulphate. None of the studies reported the effects of these interventions on all‐cause mortality. The report of complete relief from acute mountain sickness symptoms, and adverse events was infrequent. Studies related to simulated descent with the use of a hyperbaric chamber did not find additional benefits or harms related to this intervention (3 studies, 124 participants). In addition, studies related to administration of medicines found some benefits in terms of reduction of symptoms with the use of acetazolamide (2 studies, 25 participants), and dexamethasone (1 study, 35 participants), without an increase in side effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence we found was low, and thus our certainty in the findings is limited. There was insufficient information on how the studies were conducted, and in some cases there was evidence of tampering at some stages of the trials. Furthermore, the number of persons in each study was very small (< 30 participants), and therefore the results were not clear (imprecise). Some studies were not blinded (that is, participants knew what experimental treatment they were receiving), and this could have affected how the participants evaluated their own symptoms.

## Plain Title
Treatments to Help People Who Get Sick at High Altitudes in Mountains

## Rationale

**What is high altitude illness?**

When people travel to high mountains, they can get sick. This happens because there is less oxygen in the air at high places. Doctors call this ""acute mountain sickness"" or ""high altitude illness.""

**Who gets this illness?**

Some people are more likely to get sick at high altitudes. This includes:
- People who go above 4000 meters (about 13,000 feet)
- Women
- Young people
- People who get migraine headaches

**What does this illness feel like?**

Most people get mild symptoms like:
- Headache
- Not feeling hungry
- Trouble sleeping
- Feeling sick to their stomach

Some people get very sick. They may:
- Feel confused
- Have trouble walking
- Cough a lot
- Have trouble breathing
- Die in rare cases

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Researchers wanted to find out which treatments work best for mountain sickness. They wanted to know if treatments are safe. They looked at many different treatments to see which ones help people feel better.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this?**

Researchers looked at 13 studies. These studies included 468 people total.

**Who was in these studies?**

Most studies included people with mild or moderate mountain sickness. Only one study looked at people with severe brain symptoms. The studies included both men and women of different ages.

**How long did the studies last?**

Most studies were very short. They lasted less than one day. Researchers checked how people felt after getting treatment.

**What treatments did researchers test?**

Researchers tested many different treatments:
- A special pressure chamber (called a hyperbaric chamber)
- Oxygen
- Several medicines with different names

The special chamber works by making the air pressure higher. This helps the body get more oxygen.

## Results

**What did researchers find?**

Researchers found some treatments that might help. However, the results are not very clear.

**Special pressure chamber:**

Three studies with 124 people tested this treatment. The chamber did not seem to help people feel better. It also did not cause harm.

**Medicines:**

Some medicines seemed to help:
- Acetazolamide: Two studies with 25 people showed this medicine helped reduce symptoms.
- Dexamethasone: One study with 35 people showed this medicine helped reduce symptoms.

These medicines did not cause more side effects.

**What did researchers NOT find?**

The studies did not tell us:
- If any treatments prevent death
- If treatments completely cure all symptoms
- If treatments cause bad side effects

**How good is this information?**

The quality of this research is low. This means we cannot be very sure about the results.

**Why is the quality low?**

Several problems made the research less reliable:
- The studies were very small (most had fewer than 30 people)
- Some studies did not explain how they worked
- Some studies may have had problems with how they were done
- In some studies, people knew which treatment they got. This could change how they felt about their symptoms.

**What does this mean?**

We need better studies to know which treatments really work. Right now, some medicines might help reduce symptoms. But we need more research with more people to be sure.

**Conclusion:**

Some treatments may help people with mountain sickness feel better. Acetazolamide and dexamethasone showed promise in small studies. However, we need larger and better studies to know for certain which treatments work best and are safe."
10.1002-14651858.CD009868.pub3-abstract.txt,"Fixed‐dose combination drug therapy for the prevention of heart disease and stroke
Review question: We reviewed the evidence about the effect of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy on the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. We found 13 studies including 9059 participants. 
Background: We wanted to discover whether using fixed‐dose combination therapy was better or worse than other alternatives, such as usual care, placebo, or giving drugs separately, for the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. This report represents an update from a previous review published in 2014. 
Study characteristics: The evidence is current to September 2016. Four studies included individuals with a prior heart attack or stroke or with a high predicted risk for having an initial heart attack and five studies had long‐term (12 months or more) follow‐up. The main risk of bias was related to lack of blinding of participants and personnel, which was inherent to the intervention. Most study participants were middle‐aged men with moderate elevations in blood pressure or cholesterol. Two studies specifically included ethnic Aboriginal or Maori minorities in half of the study participants. The fixed‐dose combinations ranged from two to five drugs; all studies included at least one blood pressure‐lowering and one cholesterol‐lowering drug. 
Key results: The effects of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy on all‐cause mortality and fatal and non‐fatal heart attacks and strokes are uncertain, primarily due to the low number of participants experiencing these events in these studies (fewer than 5% for both) and comparisons with usual care (low‐quality evidence). Fixed‐dose combination drug therapy leads to more adverse events than control (32% versus 27%), including placebo (moderate‐quality evidence). This information is not surprising since aspirin, blood pressure‐lowering drugs and cholesterol drugs are known to increase the risk for side effects compared with placebo. Fixed‐dose combination therapy may modestly lower blood pressure (˜6 mmHg) and cholesterol (‐0.6 mmol/L in LDL cholesterol), but these effects were not consistent (moderate‐quality evidence for blood pressure and LDL cholesterol but low‐quality evidence of total cholesterol). Fixed‐dose combination therapy appears to improve adherence to medications to prevent ASCVD (moderate‐quality evidence). 
Quality of the evidence: The quality of evidence from these studies generally ranged from moderate to low. Ongoing trials of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy will likely inform clinical endpoints to guide decision‐making. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Fixed-Dose Combination Pills for Preventing Heart Disease and Stroke

## Plain Title
Testing combination pills that mix several heart medicines together to prevent heart attacks and strokes

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**
Heart attacks and strokes are major health problems. They can cause death or serious disability. Many people need to take several medicines to lower their risk. These medicines help control blood pressure and cholesterol levels.

**What was the main question?**
Researchers wanted to know if combination pills work better than other options. A combination pill puts several medicines into one pill. The other options were usual care, fake pills, or taking each medicine separately.

**Why might combination pills help?**
Taking many separate pills each day can be hard. People may forget doses or stop taking their medicines. A combination pill is simpler. It may help people take their medicines more regularly. This could prevent more heart attacks and strokes.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors needed to know if combination pills are safe and work well. This review looked at 13 studies with 9,059 people. It updates an earlier review from 2014.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was a review of 13 different studies. The researchers looked at studies published up to September 2016.

**Who was in the studies?**
Most people in the studies were middle-aged men. They had moderately high blood pressure or cholesterol. Some people had already had a heart attack or stroke. Others had a high risk of having one. Two studies included Aboriginal or Maori people as half of their participants.

**What did people receive?**
People received combination pills with 2 to 5 medicines. All combination pills included at least one blood pressure medicine and one cholesterol medicine.

**How long did the studies last?**
Five studies followed people for 12 months or longer. Four studies included people who had already had a heart attack or stroke.

## Results

**What were the main findings?**

The researchers could not tell if combination pills prevent deaths, heart attacks, or strokes. Too few people in the studies had these events. Fewer than 5 out of 100 people had these problems. This made it hard to see clear differences.

Combination pills caused more side effects than control treatments. About 32 out of 100 people taking combination pills had side effects. About 27 out of 100 people in control groups had side effects. This was expected. Blood pressure medicines, cholesterol medicines, and aspirin are known to cause side effects.

Combination pills may lower blood pressure by about 6 points. They may lower bad cholesterol by about 0.6 units. However, these results were not the same across all studies.

Combination pills helped people take their medicines more regularly. This was an important finding.

**How strong was the evidence?**

The quality of evidence was moderate to low. This means the researchers are not very certain about the results. More research is needed.

**What does this mean?**

Combination pills may help people take their medicines more regularly. They may lower blood pressure and cholesterol. However, we need more studies to know if they prevent heart attacks, strokes, or deaths. Ongoing studies will provide more information to help doctors and patients make decisions.

**Conclusions**

Combination pills are a simpler way to take heart medicines. They help people stick to their treatment plans. However, more research with larger studies is needed. These studies should follow people for longer periods. This will show if combination pills truly prevent heart attacks and strokes."
10.1002-14651858.CD009949.pub2-abstract.txt,"Aspiration of the elbow joint for treating radial head fractures
What is a radial head fracture? 
The radial head is the topmost part of the radius, which is one of the two forearm bones. The radial head is part of the elbow joint. Fracture or breaking of the radial head is the most common elbow fracture. This injury usually results from a fall onto an outstretched arm. The symptoms of a radial head fracture are pain, swelling and bruising around the elbow, as well as restricted movement. 
What is aspiration? 
One treatment for radial head fracture is aspiration. This is a procedure where a sterile needle and syringe are used to drain excess fluid and blood from the elbow joint to relieve pressure and thus, in theory, relieve pain and improve clinical outcome. However, aspiration is an invasive procedure that puts the patient at further risk of complications, such as infection and injury to nerves and vessels. The procedure is typically done in the first few days after injury. 
Aim of the review 
We aimed to assess the effects (benefits and harms) of aspiration of the elbow joint for treating radial head fracture in adults. 
Description of the studies included in the review  We searched the medical literature up to April 2014 and found two relevant studies that reported results for a total of 108 people with radial head fractures. Most participants were adults, aged 30 or over. They generally had less serious fractures and were all treated without surgery. The two studies were small, poorly reported and at high risk of bias. Neither study used reliable measures to assess function or pain. Consequently, we are very unsure of the findings of these trials. 
Summary of the evidence 
Very low quality evidence showed little difference between those who had joint aspiration and those who did not in being unable to carry heavy loads or having discomfort when carrying loads using their previously injured arm at one year after injury. Very low quality evidence shows that aspiration often provides immediate pain relief and may still provide pain relief at three weeks. Neither trial reported on adverse events from the procedure, but aspiration was reported as being unsuccessful in three participants of one study. Very low quality evidence shows little effect of aspiration on being able to extend the elbow at either six weeks or one year. The reporting of adverse events was incomplete, but one trial reported the absence of three common complications of radial head fractures. 
Conclusions 
Overall, there is not enough evidence to say whether aspiration gives better short‐term or longer‐term results than no aspiration in treating radial head fractures or how safe it is. We suggest that further research is needed to examine the use of aspiration for the initial treatment of radial head fractures. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Draining Fluid from the Elbow to Treat Broken Bones

## Plain Title
Does draining fluid from the elbow help people with a broken radial head bone heal better?

## Rationale

**What is the radial head?**
The radial head is the top part of one of the two bones in your forearm. This bone is called the radius. The radial head is part of your elbow joint.

**What happens when this bone breaks?**
Breaking the radial head is the most common type of elbow break. This injury usually happens when you fall on your arm while it is stretched out. When this bone breaks, you may have pain and swelling. You may also see bruises around your elbow. Your elbow may not move as well as it did before.

**What is aspiration?**
Aspiration is one way doctors treat this broken bone. During aspiration, a doctor uses a clean needle and syringe. The doctor puts the needle into your elbow joint. The needle drains out extra fluid and blood. This is supposed to reduce pressure in your elbow. Doctors think this might reduce pain and help you heal better.

**Why might aspiration be a problem?**
Aspiration is an invasive procedure. This means the doctor must put a needle into your body. This can cause problems. You might get an infection. The needle might hurt nerves or blood vessels. Doctors usually do aspiration in the first few days after you break your bone.

**Why was this study needed?**
Researchers wanted to know if aspiration really helps people with broken radial head bones. They wanted to know if the benefits are worth the risks.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**
Researchers looked for all medical studies about aspiration for broken radial head bones. They searched up to April 2014. They found two studies that could help answer their question.

**Who was in these studies?**
The two studies included 108 people total. Most people in the studies were adults. They were age 30 or older. Most people had less serious breaks. None of the people needed surgery for their broken bones.

**What did researchers compare?**
Some people got aspiration. Other people did not get aspiration. Researchers compared how well each group healed.

**How long did the studies last?**
Researchers checked on people at different times. They checked right after treatment. They also checked at three weeks, six weeks, and one year.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The two studies were small. They did not report information very well. This makes it hard to trust the results. The researchers could not measure function or pain in reliable ways.

**Results at one year:**
About the same number of people in both groups had trouble at one year. Some could not carry heavy loads. Some felt discomfort when carrying things with their injured arm. Aspiration did not seem to make much difference.

**Results for pain:**
Aspiration often helped reduce pain right away. It might still help with pain at three weeks. But the evidence is very weak.

**Results for elbow movement:**
Aspiration did not seem to help people extend their elbow better. This was true at six weeks and at one year.

**Were there any problems from aspiration?**
The studies did not report problems very well. One study said aspiration did not work in three people. One study said three common problems from broken radial head bones did not happen. But we do not know if aspiration caused any harm.

**What do these results mean?**
The evidence is very weak. We cannot say for sure if aspiration helps or not. We also cannot say if it is safe.

**What do researchers conclude?**
There is not enough good evidence to know if aspiration works. We need better studies. These studies should look at short-term results and long-term results. They should also carefully track any problems that happen."
10.1002-14651858.CD009961.pub2-abstract.txt,"Preventing bleeding in people with congenital bleeding disorders during and after surgery 
In haemophilia and other congenital bleeding disorders blood does not clot properly, which can cause excessive bleeding. This is particularly relevant during surgery, when the risk of bleeding depends on the type and severity of the clotting disorder and on the type of surgery. Therefore, during and after surgery, these individuals should receive treatment to improve the ability of their blood to clot and so prevent bleeding. Clotting factor concentrates (when available and appropriate in those individuals missing specific clotting proteins) or other non‐specific drugs for clotting, or a combination of both, are administered. It is not known what is the optimal dose or duration or method of administration of these treatments in these circumstances. 
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy (mortality, blood loss, need for re‐intervention, subjective assessment of efficacy, duration and dose of therapy) and the safety of any type of treatment given to people with congenital bleeding disorders during any type of surgery. We found four trials to be included in this review. Two trials evaluated 59 people with haemophilia A or B receiving antifibrinolytic drugs (agents that reduce the breakdown of clots) or placebo in addition to the initial standard treatment before dental extractions. The remaining two trials evaluated 53 people with haemophilia A or B and inhibitors (antibodies that act against the factor concentrate therapy) receiving an different clotting concentrate, recombinant activated factor VII, both during and after surgery. These two trials evaluated different treatment options: high‐dose compared with low‐dose and a single large (bolus) infusion compared with continuous infusion. 
The trials included in this review provide some information in two specific situations in people with congenital bleeding disorders undergoing surgery. However, on the whole, there is not enough evidence from trials to define the best treatments for the various types of disease and types of surgery. Further trials would be useful to improve our knowledge but are difficult to carry out and currently do not appear to be a clinical priority. Indeed, both major and minor surgery are safely performed in clinical practice in these individuals based on local experience and data from uncontrolled studies. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Preventing Bleeding During Surgery in People with Blood Clotting Disorders

## Plain Title
Treatments to Prevent Bleeding During Surgery in People Born with Blood Clotting Problems

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**

Some people are born with blood that does not clot well. This means their blood cannot form clots to stop bleeding. The most common type is called hemophilia. When people with these conditions get hurt or have surgery, they can bleed too much. This can be dangerous.

**Why is this a problem?**

Surgery is especially risky for these people. They may bleed more than others during and after an operation. The amount of bleeding depends on two things: how severe their clotting problem is and what type of surgery they need.

**What is the study about?**

Doctors give special treatments to help blood clot better during surgery. These treatments include clotting factor concentrates. These are medicines that replace missing clotting proteins in the blood. Doctors also use other drugs that help blood clot. Sometimes they use both types of treatment together.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors do not know the best way to give these treatments. They do not know the right dose to use. They do not know how long to give the treatment. They do not know the best way to give the medicine. This study looked at research to find answers to these questions.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

The researchers looked for clinical trials. They wanted trials that compared different treatments. They wanted to know which treatments work best and which are safest.

**What did the researchers find?**

They found four trials to review. These trials included 112 people total.

Two trials studied 59 people with hemophilia A or B. These people needed teeth pulled. They received standard treatment plus one of two options: a drug to help clots stay strong or a fake treatment (placebo).

Two other trials studied 53 people with hemophilia A or B. These people had a special problem called inhibitors. Inhibitors are antibodies that fight against clotting factor treatment. This makes treatment harder. These people received a different medicine called recombinant activated factor VII. They got this treatment during and after surgery.

One trial compared high doses to low doses. The other trial compared one large dose given all at once to small doses given continuously over time.

**Who was in the studies?**

All people in the studies had hemophilia or similar clotting disorders. They needed surgery or dental work.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The four trials gave some useful information. However, the information was limited to only two specific situations.

The trials did not provide enough evidence to answer the main questions. Doctors still do not know the best treatments for all types of clotting disorders. They do not know the best treatments for all types of surgery.

**What does this mean for patients?**

More research would help doctors learn more. However, these studies are hard to do. Right now, they are not considered the most important research to do.

The good news is that surgery is already done safely in people with clotting disorders. Doctors use their experience and information from other types of studies. They follow local guidelines that work well in practice. Both major surgery and minor surgery are performed safely.

**What are the conclusions?**

There is not enough evidence from controlled trials to make firm recommendations. However, doctors can safely perform surgery on people with clotting disorders. They use treatments based on experience and other research. More trials would be helpful but are not urgent. Current practice keeps patients safe during surgery."
10.1002-14651858.CD010299.pub2-abstract.txt,"Benefits of patient‐reported measures of health and well‐being versus traditional follow‐up after treatment of gynaecological cancer 
Background 
Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. The traditional method of follow‐up involves multiple visits to the hospital to check, for example, whether the cancer has come back (recurrence). This may cause anxiety among the patients and its cost effectiveness is questionable. Clinician and patient groups have asked for a consideration of alternative model approaches; since most recurrences are symptomatic, follow‐up of patients after treatment for gynaecological cancer may be accomplished by patient‐related outcome measures (PROMs) rather than routine follow‐up visits. PROMs is an umbrella term that covers a range of potential types of measurements, but is used specifically to refer to self reports by the patient of their health and well‐being. Use of PROMs as alternatives to follow‐up may have immense psychological benefits for the patient and cost benefit to the healthcare system. There is currently no evidence to determine whether PROMs are better or worse in helping women to live longer and better after gynaecological cancer rather than follow‐up visits. It is also unclear whether PROMs are  beneficial in terms of patient satisfaction or quality of life. 
Study Characteristics 
We performed an extensive literature search to identify randomised controlled studies that compared PROMs to routine follow up. 
Key findings 
No studies suitable for inclusion in our review were found. This highlights the need for good‐quality studies comparing PROMs to standard follow‐up. Evidence from adequately‐powered studies at low risk of bias are needed.

## Plain Title
Can Patient Self-Reports Replace Hospital Visits After Gynecological Cancer Treatment?

## Rationale

**What is the health condition being studied?**

Cancer is one of the top causes of death around the world. This study looks at women who have been treated for gynecological cancer. Gynecological cancer means cancer in a woman's reproductive organs.

**What is the current burden for patients?**

After cancer treatment ends, women must go to the hospital many times for check-ups. Doctors look to see if the cancer has come back. These visits can make patients feel worried and anxious. They also cost a lot of money for the healthcare system.

**Why was this study needed?**

Most of the time, when cancer comes back, patients notice symptoms themselves. This means women might not need so many hospital visits. Both doctors and patients have asked for new ways to do follow-up care.

**What approach was being tested?**

Researchers wanted to see if patient self-reports could work instead of hospital visits. These self-reports are called PROMs. PROM stands for patient-related outcome measures. This means patients answer questions about their own health and how they feel. They report any symptoms or problems themselves.

**Why might this approach help patients?**

Using PROMs could help patients feel less anxious. They would not need to go to the hospital as often. This could also save money for the healthcare system. However, no one knows yet if PROMs work as well as hospital visits. No one knows if women using PROMs live as long or feel as good.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This was not a new research study with patients. Instead, researchers looked for existing studies that had already been done. They searched medical databases to find studies that compared PROMs to regular hospital follow-up visits.

**What kind of studies were they looking for?**

They wanted to find randomized controlled studies. In these studies, some women would use PROMs for follow-up care. Other women would have regular hospital visits. Then researchers could compare the two groups.

**Who would be in these studies?**

The studies would include women of any age who had been treated for gynecological cancer.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The researchers found no studies that met their needs. Not a single study compared PROMs to regular hospital visits for women after gynecological cancer treatment.

**What does this mean?**

This shows a big gap in medical knowledge. No one has done good research on this question yet. We do not know if PROMs work as well as hospital visits. We do not know if women using PROMs live as long. We do not know if they feel as satisfied with their care. We do not know if their quality of life is as good.

**What do the researchers conclude?**

Good quality studies are badly needed. These studies must compare PROMs to standard hospital follow-up. The studies need to include enough women to give clear answers. The studies must be designed carefully to give trustworthy results.

**Why is this important?**

Until these studies are done, doctors cannot know the best way to follow up with women after cancer treatment. Women and their doctors need this information to make good choices about care. The right approach could help women feel better and worry less. It could also save money and time for everyone."
10.1002-14651858.CD010382.pub2-abstract.txt,"Non‐drug management of breathing problems for children with severe physical and intellectual impairment 
Background For a variety of reasons, some children live with very severe intellectual and physical problems; they are unable to walk or talk and require a lot of care. In this study we refer to them as children with severe global developmental delay (SGDD); this is not a specific diagnosis but is rather an 'umbrella term' used to describe a group of children with similar problems. These children may have weak or stiff muscles and deformities of their skeleton; often they have problems with swallowing, resulting in food or saliva going into their lungs. Frequently they have a poor cough reflex and lack the strength required to expel secretions when they do cough. When we sleep, our breathing becomes shallower; for some children with SGDD whose breathing is already shallow when awake, falling asleep means that they do not breathe sufficiently deeply to take in enough oxygen and breathe out enough carbon dioxide. The consequence of these problems is that their respiratory system becomes weakened; they are more likely to develop chest infections, and relatively minor infections can make them very unwell. This can result in their spending a lot of time in hospital. This affects the quality of life for these children and families and is very expensive. Many types of treatment could help, but no good summary of studies has been prepared to tell healthcare professionals which treatments are best and when they should be used; this is the reason for this review. 
Review question The aim of our review was to discover how effective each type of treatment is for managing breathing problems in children with severe global developmental delay. As so many treatments are available, we decided to look only at treatments that do not involve drugs. 
Study characteristics We carried out a wide database search to look for studies of interventions for the management of breathing problems in children with severe neurological impairment. We found 15 studies of interest, which included a number of different types of treatment. 
Key results The results showed that several different treatments provided potential benefits, and for most interventions no serious adverse effects were reported. However, the quality of the studies was not good enough to inspire confidence in the findings. Night‐time positioning equipment and spinal bracing were shown to have a potentially negative effect in some participants. Although some studies looked at the same type of treatment, they used it in different ways or used different measures to assess effectiveness, so we could not put the results together. 
Quality of the evidence Of the 15 studies included here, only four used the 'gold standard' study design for health interventions. The remainder of the studies used less robust study designs, which limits the strength of the results. Further well‐designed randomised studies including larger numbers of participants are required to guide healthcare professionals to select the most effective treatments. 
This plain‐language summary is current to November 2013.  We updated searches in November 2019 and July 2020 and added six studies to awaiting classification, but these results have not been fully incorporated into the review.

## Plain Title
Non-Drug Treatments for Breathing Problems in Children with Severe Physical and Mental Disabilities

## Rationale

**What is the health condition?**

Some children live with very severe physical and mental problems. They cannot walk or talk. They need a lot of care every day. Doctors call this severe global developmental delay, or SGDD. This is not one specific disease. It is a term that describes children who have similar problems.

**What problems do these children face?**

These children may have weak muscles or very stiff muscles. Their bones may not grow in the right shape. Many have trouble swallowing food and saliva. This means food or spit can go into their lungs instead of their stomach. They often have a weak cough. They cannot cough hard enough to clear mucus from their lungs.

When most people sleep, their breathing gets more shallow. For children with SGDD, breathing is already shallow when awake. When they fall asleep, they may not breathe deeply enough. This means they do not get enough oxygen. They also do not breathe out enough carbon dioxide.

**Why is this a burden?**

All these problems make their lungs weak. They get chest infections more easily. Even small infections can make them very sick. They often need to stay in the hospital. This affects their quality of life. It also affects their families. Hospital stays cost a lot of money.

**Why was this study needed?**

Many treatments might help these children breathe better. But no one had looked at all the studies together. Doctors need to know which treatments work best. They need to know when to use each treatment. This review was done to answer these questions.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review of other studies. Researchers looked at many medical databases. They searched for studies about breathing treatments for children with severe brain and body problems. They only looked at treatments that do not use drugs.

**Who was studied?**

The review included children with SGDD. These children had severe physical problems. They also had severe mental problems. The studies looked at different ages of children.

**What did researchers find?**

Researchers found 15 studies to include in their review. These studies tested different types of treatments. The treatments included special positioning equipment for nighttime. Some used braces for the spine. Others used different breathing support methods.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

Several different treatments showed possible benefits. Most treatments did not cause serious side effects. This is good news for children and families.

However, some treatments had problems. Nighttime positioning equipment caused negative effects in some children. Spinal bracing also caused problems for some participants.

**What were the limitations?**

The quality of the studies was not very good. This means doctors cannot be fully confident in the results. Only 4 out of 15 studies used the best study design. The other 11 studies used weaker designs.

Another problem was that studies were very different. Some studies looked at the same treatment. But they used it in different ways. They also measured results differently. This meant researchers could not combine the results together.

**What are the conclusions?**

Some non-drug treatments may help children with SGDD breathe better. But more research is needed. Future studies need better designs. They need more children in each study. This will help doctors know which treatments work best.

**Why does this matter?**

Better research will help doctors choose the right treatments. This could help children breathe better. It could reduce hospital stays. It could improve quality of life for children and families.

10.1002-14651858.CD010461.pub3-abstract.txt,"Advanced sperm selection techniques for assisted reproduction
Review question 
We sought to determine if any advanced sperm selection techniques used for assisted reproduction, except for ultra‐high magnification, alter the rates of live birth, clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, or foetal abnormalities. 
Background 
In vitro fertilisation (IVF) with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is a commonly used treatment for subfertile couples. It is thought that the selection of high‐quality sperm may improve outcomes for these couples. Advanced sperm selection techniques use complex methods to select healthy, mature, and structurally sound sperm for fertilisation. Despite the use of these techniques in many centres worldwide, their effectiveness is unclear. 
Study characteristics 
We included eight randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) with a total of 4147 women. Four studies evaluated sperm selection by their ability to bind to hyaluronic acid during the ICSI process (HA‐ICSI) against ICSI. One study compared HA‐ICSI versus SpermSlow. One study compared HA‐ICSI versus magnetic‐activated cell sorting (MACS) versus ICSI. Three studies compared MACS versus ICSI. One study compared sperm selection by surface charge Zeta potential versus ICSI. Six of the included studies reported rates of live birth; seven reported clinical pregnancy; six reported miscarriage per clinical pregnancy and per woman randomly assigned; and none reported on foetal abnormalities. 
Key results 
The current evidence suggests that advanced sperm selection strategies in assisted reproductive technologist (ART) may not result in an increase in the likelihood of live birth. The only sperm selection technique that potentially increases live birth and clinical pregnancy rates is Zeta sperm selection, yet these results were of very low quality and derived from a single study, therefore we are uncertain of the effect. There is low‐quality evidence that HA‐ICSI decreases miscarriage rates when compared with ICSI. We are uncertain whether the other sperm selection techniques alter clinical pregnancy or miscarriage rates. No studies reported on foetal abnormalities, and further studies of suitable quality are required before any of these advanced sperm selection techniques can be recommended for use in clinical practice. 
Evidence quality 
The evidence gathered was of very low to low quality. The main limitations were imprecision associated with low numbers of participants or events and high risk of performance bias. Data on important clinical outcomes such as foetal abnormalities were absent. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Do Advanced Sperm Selection Methods Improve Success Rates for Couples Using Fertility Treatment?

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**
Some couples have trouble getting pregnant naturally. This is called subfertility. These couples often need help from doctors to have a baby.

**What treatments are available?**
Doctors use fertility treatments called IVF and ICSI. IVF stands for in vitro fertilization. This means doctors combine eggs and sperm in a lab. ICSI means doctors inject one sperm directly into an egg.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors think that picking the best, healthiest sperm might help more couples have babies. Advanced sperm selection uses special methods to find the strongest and healthiest sperm. Many fertility clinics around the world use these methods. However, no one knows for sure if they actually work better than standard methods.

**What did researchers want to find out?**
Researchers wanted to know if advanced sperm selection methods help more women have live births. They also wanted to know if these methods affect pregnancy rates, miscarriage rates, or birth defects.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was a review study. Researchers looked at eight different studies that had already been done. These studies included 4,147 women in total.

The studies tested different sperm selection methods:
- Four studies tested HA-ICSI (sperm selected by sticking to a substance called hyaluronic acid)
- Three studies tested MACS (sperm selected using magnets)
- One study tested Zeta selection (sperm selected by electrical charge)
- One study compared HA-ICSI to SpermSlow

All studies compared these advanced methods to standard ICSI. Researchers assigned women to different treatment groups randomly. This means each woman had an equal chance of getting any treatment.

**Who was in the studies?**
All participants were women seeking fertility treatment. The studies did not specify exact ages.

**What did researchers measure?**
Researchers counted:
- Live births (babies born alive)
- Clinical pregnancies (pregnancies confirmed by doctors)
- Miscarriages (pregnancy losses)
- Birth defects (none of the studies reported this)

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The research showed that advanced sperm selection methods probably do not increase the chance of having a baby.

**Live births:** Most advanced sperm selection methods did not improve live birth rates. Only one method called Zeta selection might help. However, only one small study tested this method. More research is needed to be sure.

**Pregnancies:** Most methods did not increase pregnancy rates compared to standard treatment.

**Miscarriages:** HA-ICSI might reduce miscarriage rates compared to standard ICSI. However, the evidence quality was low. Researchers are not certain about other methods.

**Birth defects:** No studies measured birth defects. This is an important gap in the research.

**What does this mean for patients?**

Based on current evidence, advanced sperm selection methods do not clearly improve fertility treatment success. Couples should not expect better results from these methods.

**Why is the evidence uncertain?**

The quality of evidence was very low to low. This means we cannot be very confident in the results. The main problems were:
- Studies had small numbers of participants
- Studies did not measure important outcomes like birth defects
- Studies had design problems that could affect results

**What happens next?**

More high-quality studies are needed. Until then, doctors should not routinely recommend these advanced sperm selection methods. Couples considering fertility treatment should discuss standard methods with their doctors first.

**Conclusion**

Current evidence does not support using advanced sperm selection methods in fertility treatment. Standard methods remain the best choice until better research proves otherwise."
10.1002-14651858.CD010497.pub2-abstract.txt,"Oral fumaric acid esters for the treatment of psoriasis
Background 
Psoriasis is a long‐term inflammatory skin condition that can markedly reduce the quality of life of affected individuals. Treatments taken by mouth (oral treatments), such as methotrexate, ciclosporin, and acitretin, are commonly prescribed to people with moderate to severe psoriasis. Oral fumaric acid esters (FAE) are licensed for the treatment of psoriasis in Germany but remain unlicensed in most other countries. This means that there are different treatment options offered to people in different countries. 
Review question 
What is the available evidence for the benefits and risks of using FAE for treating psoriasis? 
Study characteristics 
Our review included six randomised control trials (RCTs) that involved 544 participants. Five RCTs compared FAE with placebo, and one compared FAE with methotrexate. The outcomes we were interested in measuring were the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), which is a psoriasis severity score, and the proportion of participants who discontinued treatment because of adverse (side) effects that are common but sufficiently serious that the drug had to be stopped, such as severe diarrhoea, infections, or cutaneous malignancy. 
Key results 
It was difficult to pool and compare results because outcome measures differed between the studies. Three studies reported significant benefit with FAE when compared with placebo after 12 to 16 weeks of treatment, but we could not combine these results in a statistical analysis to show the overall difference. The included studies did not fully examine the chance of discontinuing FAE treatment because of adverse effects, which is uncertain. One study showed that individuals on FAE are nearly five times more likely to develop nuisance adverse effects; the most common were diarrhoea and abdominal cramps, flushing, reversible protein loss in the urine, and raised levels of eosinophil blood cells. Two RCTs were similar enough to allow the combination of their results and found that FAE were better than placebo when measured by the proportion of individuals who experienced at least a 50% improvement in their psoriasis severity score. One study reported improvement of individuals' quality of life with FAE in comparison with placebo, but the significance of this difference could not be calculated. The benefit of FAE was similar to methotrexate after 12 weeks when changes in disease severity from the start to the end of the trial were compared. The number of individuals experiencing nuisance adverse effects with these two treatments was not significantly different. The included studies, which were too small and of limited duration to provide evidence about rare or delayed effects, reported no serious adverse effects of FAE. 
Quality of the evidence 
The risk of study bias, which means any factors that may systematically deviate away from the true findings, was unclear in most studies. This may be because most of the studies were conducted decades ago or were incompletely reported. Several analyses comparing FAE with placebo and methotrexate were limited because the studies were small or did not provide enough information to establish how these treatments compare with each other. Therefore, the overall quality of the evidence was low when comparing FAE with placebo and very low when comparing FAE with methotrexate. 
Future RCTs should use standard psoriasis outcome measures, including a validated quality of life scale, to enable the comparison and combination of results. They should be longer in duration or have longer follow‐up phases to provide evidence about any delayed adverse effects. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Oral Fumaric Acid Esters for Treating Psoriasis

## Plain Title
Testing Pills Called Fumaric Acid Esters to Treat a Skin Condition Called Psoriasis

## Rationale

**What is psoriasis and why does it matter?**

Psoriasis is a skin condition that lasts a long time. It causes red, scaly patches on the skin. This condition can make people feel very uncomfortable. It can also make daily life harder and affect how people feel about themselves.

**What treatments are available?**

Doctors treat psoriasis in different ways. For people with moderate to severe psoriasis, doctors often prescribe pills. These pills include drugs like methotrexate, ciclosporin, and acitretin. Another pill option is fumaric acid esters, or FAE for short.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

FAE pills are approved for use in Germany. However, most other countries have not approved them yet. This means people in different countries get different treatment choices. Researchers wanted to find out if FAE pills really work. They also wanted to know if these pills are safe to use.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this?**

Researchers looked at six studies. These studies included 544 people total. The studies were randomized control trials, or RCTs. This means researchers divided people into groups by chance. This helps make the results more reliable.

**What did the studies compare?**

Five studies compared FAE pills to fake pills (called placebo). One study compared FAE pills to methotrexate pills.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included people with psoriasis. The abstract does not give specific details about age or gender.

**How long did the studies last?**

Most studies lasted 12 to 16 weeks.

**What did researchers measure?**

Researchers measured how severe the psoriasis was. They used a scoring system called PASI. They also counted how many people stopped taking the pills because of side effects.

## Results

**Did FAE pills help?**

Three studies showed that FAE pills worked better than fake pills. People taking FAE pills saw their psoriasis improve after 12 to 16 weeks. However, researchers could not combine all the study results. This is because the studies measured things in different ways.

Two studies were similar enough to combine. These studies showed that FAE pills worked better than fake pills. More people taking FAE pills had at least a 50% improvement. This means their psoriasis got at least half as bad.

One study showed that people felt better about their quality of life. This happened when they took FAE pills instead of fake pills.

**How did FAE compare to other treatments?**

One study compared FAE pills to methotrexate pills. After 12 weeks, both treatments worked about the same. The number of people having bothersome side effects was similar for both pills.

**What side effects happened?**

FAE pills caused more bothersome side effects than fake pills. People taking FAE were nearly five times more likely to have these problems. The most common side effects were:
- Diarrhea (loose, watery stools)
- Stomach cramps
- Flushing (skin turning red and feeling warm)
- Protein in the urine (this went away after stopping the pills)
- Higher levels of certain white blood cells

Some people had to stop taking FAE pills because of these side effects. However, the studies did not fully examine how often this happened.

The studies did not report any serious side effects. However, the studies were small and short. This means they could not find rare side effects. They also could not find side effects that happen later.

**What do these results mean?**

The evidence quality was low. This is because the studies were small. Many studies were done many years ago. Some studies did not report their methods clearly. This makes it hard to know if the results are fully trustworthy.

**What should happen next?**

Future studies should be larger and longer. They should measure psoriasis in the same way. This would help researchers combine results from different studies. Longer studies would help find side effects that happen later."
10.1002-14651858.CD010613.pub2-abstract.txt,"Intensity of continuous renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury
What is the issue? 
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is very common among patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU), it is associated with a high death rated and characterised by the rapid loss of the kidney function. Patients with AKI show increased levels of serum uraemic toxins (creatinine and urea), serum potassium and metabolic acids, accumulation of water and in the most cases a reduction in urine output. In this population these chemicals and fluid overload are related to increased rates of death. Theoretically, effective removal of toxins and excess water from the bloodstream might improve patient outcomes (such as mortality rate and recovery of kidney function). 
Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a blood purification technique that enables removal of excess water and toxins. CRRT involves blood being diverted from the patient via a catheter (a hollow, flexible tube placed into a vein) through a filtering system which continuously and steadily removes excess water and toxins; purified blood is then returned to the patient via the catheter. Higher intensity CRRT improves the removal of toxins and excess water. The aim of this review was to investigate the effect of different intensities of CRRT (intensive or less intensive) on death, recovery of kidney function, and adverse events in people with AKI who are critically ill. 
What did we do? 
We searched the literature up until February 2016 and identified six studies enrolling 3185 patients with AKI that were evaluated in this review. 
What did we find? 
Six randomised studies enrolling 3185 participants were included in our review. Compared to less intensive CRRT, intensive CRRT did not reduce the risk of death, improve the recovery of kidney function, or reduce the risk of adverse events (such as bleeding) in patients with AKI. Intensive CRRT was associated with an increased risk of low blood phosphate levels.

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Strengths of Blood Cleaning Treatment for Patients with Sudden Kidney Failure

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some people who are very sick in the hospital suddenly lose their kidney function. This is called acute kidney injury, or AKI. It happens often to people in intensive care units.

**What does this cause?**

When kidneys stop working well, harmful waste builds up in the blood. These wastes include chemicals called creatinine and urea. The body also holds too much water, potassium, and acid. Many people with AKI make less urine than normal. These problems can lead to death.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors use a treatment called CRRT to clean the blood. CRRT stands for continuous renal replacement therapy. This treatment works like an artificial kidney. It removes waste and extra water from the blood.

A tube is placed into a vein. Blood flows through this tube to a cleaning machine. The machine filters out waste and extra water. Then the clean blood goes back into the body through the same tube. This happens slowly and steadily.

**What was the main question?**

Doctors can use CRRT at different strengths. Stronger CRRT cleans the blood faster. It removes more waste and water. Researchers wanted to know: Does stronger CRRT help patients live longer? Does it help kidneys work again? They compared stronger CRRT to less strong CRRT.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review of research studies. Researchers looked at six different studies. These studies included 3,185 patients total. The researchers searched for studies up to February 2016.

**Who was in the studies?**

All patients had acute kidney injury. They were very sick and in intensive care units. The studies included both men and women. The studies included adults of different ages.

**What did the studies compare?**

Some patients got stronger CRRT treatment. Other patients got less strong CRRT treatment. Researchers then compared the two groups.

**What did researchers measure?**

They looked at how many patients died. They checked if kidneys started working again. They watched for harmful side effects. These included problems like bleeding or low blood chemical levels.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

Stronger CRRT did not help patients live longer. The number of deaths was the same in both groups.

Stronger CRRT did not help kidneys recover better. Both groups had similar kidney recovery rates.

Stronger CRRT did not reduce harmful side effects. Problems like bleeding happened at similar rates in both groups.

Stronger CRRT did cause one problem. It lowered phosphate levels in the blood too much. Phosphate is an important chemical the body needs.

**What does this mean?**

Using stronger CRRT does not provide extra benefits. It does not save more lives. It does not help kidneys heal faster. But it can cause low phosphate levels.

**What are the main conclusions?**

For patients with sudden kidney failure, stronger blood cleaning does not work better than regular strength blood cleaning. Doctors should use regular strength CRRT. This avoids the risk of low phosphate while providing the same benefits.

**Why is this important?**

This research helps doctors choose the best treatment. It shows that more intensive treatment is not always better. Regular strength CRRT is safer and works just as well.

Review question  Is corneal collagen cross‐linking (CXL) a good treatment for slowing down the progression of keratoconus? 
Background  Keratoconus is a condition where the transparent front of the eye (cornea) gets thinner and begins to bulge. This leads to vision problems, usually short‐sightedness (distant objects appear blurred). The condition is more common in children and young adults and can deteriorate over time. Initially glasses and contact lenses can help. If the disease progresses, the only option may be a corneal transplant. 
CXL is a new treatment for keratoconus. The eye doctor removes the outer layer of the cornea, puts in vitamin B2 eye drops, and then treats the eye with ultraviolet A light radiation. This can be done in outpatients and takes about an hour. 
Study characteristics  The searches are current to August 2014. We found three randomised controlled trials, which were done in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. A total of 219 eyes were randomly allocated to treatment with CXL or no treatment. In all three studies the surgery was done in the same way. None of the studies included children. 
Key results  Eyes treated with CXL were less likely to have problems with progression of bulging compared to eyes that were not treated. However, the studies were small and there were some concerns about the way they were done. It is therefore difficult to say exactly how much the treatment helped. None of the studies reported the risk of eyesight getting worse but, on average, treated eyes had better vision (about 10 letters better) compared to untreated eyes. None of the studies reported on a change in quality of life for the participant. The main adverse effects were inflammation and swelling; this occurred in approximately one in 10 participants. 
Quality of the evidence  We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low because of problems in the way the studies were done and reported and the small number of eyes included. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Corneal Collagen Cross-Linking for Keratoconus

## Plain Title
A treatment to slow down eye thinning in people with keratoconus

## Rationale

**What is keratoconus?**
Keratoconus is a disease of the eye. The clear front part of the eye is called the cornea. In keratoconus, the cornea gets thinner. It also starts to bulge outward. This causes vision problems. People with this disease cannot see things far away clearly. Things look blurred.

**Who gets keratoconus?**
This disease is more common in children and young adults. The disease can get worse over time. At first, glasses or contact lenses can help people see better. If the disease keeps getting worse, a person may need a cornea transplant. This means getting a new cornea from a donor.

**What is the new treatment?**
Doctors wanted to test a new treatment called corneal collagen cross-linking, or CXL for short. This treatment might slow down or stop the disease from getting worse.

**Why test this treatment?**
Researchers wanted to know if CXL works better than no treatment. They wanted to see if it could help people avoid needing a transplant.

## Trial Design

**How does the treatment work?**
The eye doctor does these steps:
- Takes off the outer layer of the cornea
- Puts vitamin B2 eye drops in the eye
- Shines a special ultraviolet light on the eye

The treatment takes about one hour. People can go home the same day.

**How was the study designed?**
Researchers looked at three studies. These studies were done in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The studies included 219 eyes total. Some eyes got the CXL treatment. Other eyes got no treatment. Doctors then compared the two groups.

**Who was in the studies?**
All three studies included adults only. No children were in these studies. All people in the studies had keratoconus.

**How long did the studies last?**
The studies followed people for different amounts of time. This let doctors see if the treatment helped over time.

## Results

**Did the treatment work?**
Eyes that got CXL treatment did better than eyes with no treatment. The disease was less likely to get worse in treated eyes. The bulging of the cornea did not progress as much.

**Did vision improve?**
The studies did not report if eyesight got worse in either group. But on average, treated eyes could see better. People could read about 10 more letters on an eye chart. This is a small but helpful improvement.

**Were there side effects?**
Some people had problems after treatment. About 1 in 10 people had swelling or inflammation in the eye. These were the main side effects.

**What about quality of life?**
None of the studies asked people about their quality of life. We do not know if the treatment made daily life better or easier.

**What are the limitations?**
The studies had some problems. They were small studies. Only 219 eyes were included total. There were also concerns about how the studies were done. Because of these problems, we cannot be completely sure how much the treatment helps.

**What do the results mean?**
CXL treatment may help slow down keratoconus. It may help people see a bit better. But we need more and better studies. Larger studies with more people would give us more confidence. Studies that include children would also be helpful.

**Final conclusion**
CXL shows promise as a treatment for keratoconus. It appears to slow disease progression. But the evidence quality is very low. More research is needed to know for sure how well it works."
10.1002-14651858.CD010709.pub2-abstract.txt,"Pre‐emptive correction of stenosis of the arteriovenous access for haemodialysis
An arteriovenous access consists of a direct surgical connection between an artery and a vein in the arm (fistula) or a plastic conduit connecting an artery and a vein (graft). If these forms of access become dysfunctional the delivery of dialysis therapy becomes suboptimal. The most common cause of access dysfunction is the development of a restriction or conduit narrowing called 'stenosis'. Because early correction of stenosis is considered critical to maintain the patency (openness) of the access and prolong its use, guidelines recommend regular surveillance of the access (i.e. screening based on diagnostic tests) in addition to or instead of a physical exam (clinical monitoring) to identify and treat early lesions. 
In this review we included 14 studies, randomising 1390 participants to either a pre‐emptive correction of an access stenosis (i.e. before the access became dysfunctional) or a deferred correction of an access stenosis (i.e. if and when the access became dysfunctional). This review shows that pre‐emptive correction of an arteriovenous access stenosis does not improve longevity of the access overall. In people using grafts pre‐emptive correction does not reduce the risk of thrombosis or access loss. In people using fistulas pre‐emptive stenosis correction reduces the risk of thrombosis and may prolong the longevity of the access. However, this surveillance and pre‐emptive correction strategy may increase the number of access‐related procedures and procedure‐related adverse events. 
This systematic review presents, to clinicians and patients, evidence‐based data that do not support the use of access surveillance and pre‐emptive correction of stenosis in grafts. Although surveillance and pre‐emptive correction of stenosis reduce the risk of thrombosis and may reduce the risk of access loss in fistulas, they may also increase the risk of procedure‐related adverse events and health‐care cost. Large multicentre clinical trials are necessary in this patient population to better clarify potential harms and expected benefits of routine surveillance and pre‐emptive correction of fistula stenosis.

## Plain Title
Does Early Treatment of Narrowed Blood Vessels Help Dialysis Access Last Longer?

## Rationale

**What is dialysis access and why is it important?**

People with kidney failure need dialysis to clean their blood. To do dialysis, doctors create a special connection in the arm called an ""access."" There are two types:
- A fistula: doctors connect an artery directly to a vein
- A graft: doctors use a plastic tube to connect an artery to a vein

**What is the problem?**

Sometimes these connections get narrow. This narrowing is called ""stenosis."" When stenosis happens, dialysis may not work as well. Stenosis is the most common reason dialysis access stops working.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors wanted to know the best time to fix stenosis. Should they fix it early, before problems start? Or should they wait until the access stops working? Medical guidelines say doctors should do regular tests to find stenosis early and fix it right away. But researchers wanted to know if this approach really helps patients.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to see if fixing stenosis early helps the dialysis access last longer. They also wanted to know if early treatment prevents blood clots and reduces other problems.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at 14 different studies that had already been done. They combined the results to get better answers.

**Who was in these studies?**

A total of 1,390 people were in these studies. All of them:
- Had kidney failure
- Needed dialysis
- Had either a fistula or graft in their arm
- Had stenosis (narrowing) in their dialysis access

**What did researchers compare?**

Researchers divided people into two groups:
- Early treatment group: doctors fixed the stenosis before the access stopped working
- Wait-and-see group: doctors only fixed the stenosis if and when the access stopped working

**How long did the studies last?**

The length of time varied across the different studies included in this review.

## Results

**What did researchers find overall?**

Early treatment of stenosis did not help dialysis access last longer overall. The results were different for grafts and fistulas.

**Results for people with grafts:**

Early treatment did not help people with grafts. It did not:
- Reduce blood clots
- Help the graft last longer
- Provide clear benefits

**Results for people with fistulas:**

Early treatment helped people with fistulas in some ways:
- It reduced blood clots
- It may help the fistula last longer

However, early treatment also caused some problems:
- People needed more procedures on their access
- More side effects happened from these extra procedures

**What do these results mean for patients?**

For people with grafts, regular testing and early treatment are not helpful. Doctors should not do routine screening for stenosis in grafts.

For people with fistulas, the answer is less clear. Early treatment may help prevent blood clots and keep the fistula working longer. But it also means more procedures and more side effects. It may also cost more money.

**What do researchers conclude?**

More research is needed. Large studies should be done to better understand:
- The benefits of early treatment for fistulas
- The risks and side effects of extra procedures
- Whether the benefits are worth the costs and risks

**Why is this study important?**

This study gives doctors and patients clear information. It shows that one common medical practice (routine testing and early treatment for grafts) does not help patients. For fistulas, patients and doctors need to weigh the benefits against the risks when deciding about early treatment."
10.1002-14651858.CD010789.pub2-abstract.txt,"Whole‐body cryotherapy for preventing and treating muscle soreness after exercise
Background and aim of the review 
Delayed onset muscle soreness describes the muscular pain, tenderness and stiffness experienced after high‐intensity or unaccustomed exercise. Various therapies are in use to prevent or reduce muscle soreness after exercise and to enhance recovery. One more recent therapy that is growing in use is whole‐body cryotherapy (WBC). This involves single or repeated exposure(s) to extremely cold dry air (below ‐100°C) in a specialised chamber or cabin for two to four minutes per exposure. This review aimed to find out whether WBC reduced muscle soreness, improved recovery and was safe for those people for whom it can be used. 
Results of the search 
We searched medical databases up to August 2015 for studies that compared WBC with a control intervention such as passive rest or no treatment; or with another active intervention such as cold water immersion. We found four small studies. These reported results for a total of 64 physically active young adults. All but four participants were male. The studies were very varied such as the type, temperature, duration and frequency of the WBC and the exercises used to induce muscle soreness. There were two comparisons: WBC compared with a control intervention; and WBC compared with far‐infrared therapy. 
Key results 
All four studies compared WBC with either passive rest or no treatment. These provided some evidence that WBC may reduce muscle soreness (pain at rest) at 1, 24, 48 and 72 hours after exercise. However, the evidence also included the possibility that WBC may not make a difference or may make the pain worse. There was some weak evidence that WBC may improve well‐being at 24 hours. There was no report and probably no monitoring of adverse events in these four studies. 
One very small study also compared WBC with far‐infrared therapy and reported lower levels of muscle soreness one hour after the treatment. 
Quality of the evidence 
All four studies had aspects that could undermine the reliability of their results. We decided that the evidence was of very low quality for all outcomes. Thus, the findings remain very uncertain and further research may provide evidence that could change our conclusions. 
Conclusions 
The currently available evidence is insufficient to support the use of WBC for preventing and treating muscle soreness after exercise in adults. Furthermore, the best prescription of WBC and its safety are not known.

## Plain Title
Whole-Body Cryotherapy to Prevent and Treat Muscle Soreness After Exercise

## Rationale

### What is muscle soreness?
When people exercise hard or try new exercises, their muscles often hurt. This pain usually starts later and can last for days. Doctors call this delayed onset muscle soreness. The muscles feel painful, tender, and stiff. This can make it hard to move and exercise again.

### Why did researchers do this study?
Many people try different treatments to prevent or reduce muscle soreness after exercise. They want to feel better faster. One newer treatment is whole-body cryotherapy, or WBC. This treatment is becoming more popular.

### What is whole-body cryotherapy?
WBC means standing in a special room or cabin that is extremely cold. The air temperature is below minus 100 degrees Celsius. That is much colder than a freezer. People stay in this cold room for 2 to 4 minutes. Some people do this once. Others do it several times.

### Why might this treatment work?
Researchers wanted to know if WBC could help reduce muscle pain. They also wanted to know if it helped people recover faster. They needed to find out if WBC was safe to use.

## Trial Design

### How did researchers study this?
Researchers looked for all studies about WBC and muscle soreness. They searched medical databases up to August 2015. They found 4 small studies to review.

### Who was in these studies?
The studies included 64 people total. Almost all were young men. Only 4 women were included. All participants were physically active adults.

### What did the studies compare?
The studies compared different treatments:
- WBC versus doing nothing or just resting
- WBC versus another treatment called far-infrared therapy

### How were the studies different?
Each study was done differently. They used different temperatures in the cold rooms. They used different amounts of time in the cold. Some people went in once. Others went in multiple times. The studies also used different types of exercise to cause muscle soreness.

### How long did the studies last?
The studies measured muscle soreness at different times. They checked pain levels at 1 hour, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours after exercise.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
All 4 studies compared WBC to resting or doing nothing. The results showed that WBC might reduce muscle soreness. This possible benefit was seen at 1 hour, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours after exercise.

However, the results were not clear. The evidence also showed that WBC might not help at all. It might even make pain worse. Researchers could not be sure either way.

One study found that WBC might help people feel better overall at 24 hours. But this evidence was weak.

### What about safety?
None of the studies reported on safety problems. The studies probably did not watch for side effects or harmful events. This means we do not know if WBC is safe.

One very small study compared WBC to far-infrared therapy. It found less muscle soreness 1 hour after WBC treatment.

### How good was the evidence?
All 4 studies had problems with how they were done. These problems made the results less reliable. The researchers rated the evidence as very low quality. This means we cannot trust these results very much.

### What do the results mean?
The evidence is not strong enough to recommend WBC for muscle soreness. We need better studies to know if it really works. We also do not know the best way to use WBC. We do not know how cold it should be. We do not know how long people should stay in the cold room. We do not know how many times they should do it.

### Main conclusions
Right now, there is not enough good evidence to support using WBC for muscle soreness after exercise. More research is needed. Future studies might change these conclusions. We also need to learn more about safety before recommending this treatment."
10.1002-14651858.CD010852.pub2-abstract.txt,"Hypnosis for induction of labour
Labour induction is the artificial stimulation of uterine contractions in order to bring about birth. It is commonly used in late pregnancy to address maternal and fetal problems. Induction of labour using pharmacological and mechanical methods can cause complications or side‐effects such as bleeding, caesarean section uterine hyperstimulation and maternal and newborn infections. A complementary and alternative medicine method, such as hypnosis, may provide a safe alternative method for inducing labour. 
Hypnosis is a relaxation technique in which the person closes down their awareness of external distractions to concentrate on a specific image, thoughts or feelings. Hypnosis has long been used to reduce pain perception during labour and hypnotic relaxation may be beneficial for women who are extremely anxious about giving birth. Hypnosis may increase self‐confidence and well‐being and be associated with decreased costs to the healthcare system if effective. The effectiveness of hypnosis for induction of labour has not however been evaluated. We searched for randomised controlled trials that examined the effect of hypnosis for induction of labour. We did not find any studies for inclusion in this review. Trials using hypnosis are required so that the effectiveness and safety of hypnotic relaxation to induce labour in pregnant women with high levels of anxiety can be fully evaluated. The length and timing of the intervention, as well as the staff training required, and the views and experiences of women and staff, should be taken into consideration. As hypnosis may delay standard care (in case standard care is withheld during hypnosis), its use in induction of labour should be considered on a case‐by‐case basis. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Hypnosis for Starting Labor

## Plain Title
Can Hypnosis Help Start Labor in Pregnant Women?

## Rationale

**What is labor induction?**
Labor induction means doctors help start labor using medical methods. This is done when a woman's body does not start labor on its own. Doctors may need to start labor when the baby is overdue or when there are health concerns for the mother or baby.

**What are the current problems?**
Doctors usually use medicines or medical tools to start labor. These methods can sometimes cause problems. Women may bleed more than normal. Some women need surgery to deliver their baby. The uterus (womb) may contract too much or too hard. Both mothers and babies can get infections from these methods.

**What is hypnosis?**
Hypnosis is a way to help people relax deeply. During hypnosis, a person closes their eyes and focuses on calm thoughts or images. They tune out what is happening around them. Hypnosis has been used for many years to help women feel less pain during labor. It may help women who feel very worried or scared about giving birth.

**Why study hypnosis for starting labor?**
Researchers wanted to know if hypnosis could be a safe way to start labor. Hypnosis might help women feel more calm and confident. It could also cost less money than other methods. If hypnosis works well, it could be a good choice instead of medicines or medical tools.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
The researchers looked for studies that tested hypnosis for starting labor. They wanted to find studies where some women got hypnosis and other women did not. This type of study is called a randomized controlled trial. It is the best way to test if a treatment works.

**What did the researchers find?**
The researchers did not find any studies to include in their review. No studies have tested whether hypnosis can help start labor in pregnant women.

## Results

**What were the main results?**
There were no results because no studies were found. The researchers could not answer whether hypnosis works to start labor.

**What does this mean?**
More research is needed. Scientists need to do studies to test if hypnosis is safe and works well for starting labor. These studies should focus on pregnant women who feel very anxious or worried about giving birth.

**What should future studies look at?**
Future studies should answer several important questions:
- How long should hypnosis sessions last?
- When should hypnosis be used during pregnancy?
- What training do doctors and nurses need to use hypnosis?
- What do women think about using hypnosis?
- What do doctors and nurses think about using hypnosis?

**Important things to consider:**
Using hypnosis might delay other medical care. If doctors wait to use standard methods while trying hypnosis, this could be a problem. For this reason, doctors should think carefully about each woman's situation. They should decide if hypnosis is right for that person.

**Conclusions:**
Right now, we do not know if hypnosis can safely start labor. We need good studies to find out. Until then, doctors and pregnant women should talk about all options. They should make decisions together based on each woman's needs and health."
10.1002-14651858.CD011082.pub2-abstract.txt,"Antimicrobial dressings attached to the central venous catheters in reducing catheter‐related infections in newborn infants 
Review question: In newborn infants who require a central venous catheter, does the use of antiseptic or antibiotic catheter dressing, compared to no dressing, reduce catheter‐related infections? 
Background: Central venous catheters (CVCs) are small tubes inserted into the vein to give fluids, medication and intravenous nutrition to sick patients. The risks of CVCs are well‐known, and can cause infections, which may result in death or serious illnesses. Newborn infants are vulnerable, as they on the one hand require the CVCs to sustain life, and on the other hand are at high risks of the complications, due to their thin skin and poorly‐developed immune system. 
Several measures have been developed to reduce infections in newborn infants. These include hand hygiene for caregivers, skin cleaning for the infants, antibiotics and modification of the catheters including the use of antiseptic or antibiotic‐coated catheter dressing or patch that could be placed on the skin at the CVC insertion site. While promising, these measures need on‐going evaluation. In this review, we synthesized up‐to‐date evidence on the effectiveness and safety of antiseptic or antibiotic dressing as a part of CVC care in sick newborn infants. 
Search date: We performed a search in multiple medical databases in September 2015. 
Study characteristics: Three studies (total participants: 855) fit our inclusion criteria. There were two main comparisons: i) chlorhexidine dressing and alcohol skin cleansing against standard polyurethane dressing and povidone‐iodine skin cleansing (from one large study), and ii) silver‐alginate patch against a control group without patch (from two smaller studies). The quality of the included studies are high, except that the people closely involved in the trials such as the care personnel were not masked from knowing whether or not the infants in the study were given antiseptic or antibiotic dressing, which might have affected their recording or interpretation of the results. 
Study funding sources: One of the studies was funded in part by Johnson and Johnson Medical; Children's Foundation; Children's Hospital, Milwaukee and National Institutes of Health. Another study was funded by the Vanderbilt NICU Research Fund. Funding source was not stated in the third study. 
Key results: In our main findings, chlorhexidine dressing/alcohol skin cleansing made no difference to catheter‐related blood stream infection (CRBSI) and blood stream infection (""sepsis"") without an identifiable source, although it significantly reduced the chance of micro‐organisms lodging in the CVCs (""catheter colonisation""), with an average of 9% reduction in risk among newborn infants with a baseline risk of 24% (1 study, 655 infants). However, infants who received chlorhexidine dressing/alcohol skin cleansing were more likely to develop skin irritation (""contact dermatitis""), as 19 out of 335 infants (5.7%) in the chlorhexidine group developed this complication compared to none in the group that received standard dressing/povidone‐iodine cleansing. However, it was unclear whether the dressing or the alcohol solution was mainly responsible for the skin irritation, as the other group did not use alcohol solution for skin cleansing. In the other comparison, silver‐alginate patch made no overall differences in CRBSI and mortality compared to no dressing, neither did it cause any adverse reaction. 
Quality of the evidence: There was moderate‐quality evidence for all the major outcomes. The major factor that affected the quality of evidence was the lack of precision in the result estimates, as the calculated plausible range of the effects (the 95% confidence intervals) were wide. 
Conclusions: Chlorhexidine CVC dressing with alcohol skin cleansing posed a high risk of skin irritation against a modest reduction in catheter colonisation. For silver‐alginate patch, evidence is still insufficient for a clear picture of benefit an harm. We have made recommendations for future research that evaluate these interventions.

## Plain Title
Special Dressings on Tubes in Newborn Babies' Veins: Do They Stop Infections?

## Rationale

### What is the health problem?

Some newborn babies are very sick. They need small tubes put into their veins. These tubes are called central venous catheters or CVCs. Doctors use these tubes to give babies fluids, medicine, and food.

But these tubes can cause problems. Germs can get into the tubes and cause infections. These infections can make babies very sick. Some babies can even die from these infections.

### Why are newborn babies at special risk?

Newborn babies are at high risk for two reasons. First, their skin is very thin. Second, their bodies cannot fight germs well yet. Their immune system is not fully grown.

But these babies need the tubes to stay alive. This puts doctors in a hard spot.

### What might help?

Doctors have tried many ways to stop infections. They wash their hands well. They clean the baby's skin. They give antibiotics. They also try special dressings or patches on the skin where the tube goes in.

These dressings have medicine in them. The medicine kills germs. Some dressings have chlorhexidine. Others have silver.

### Why was this study needed?

Doctors need to know if these special dressings really work. They also need to know if the dressings are safe. This study looked at all the research done so far. It tried to answer these questions.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?

This was a review study. The researchers looked at other studies that had already been done. They searched medical databases in September 2015. They found three studies that fit their needs.

### Who was in the studies?

All three studies included newborn babies. These babies needed tubes in their veins. In total, 855 babies were in all three studies.

### What did the studies compare?

The studies looked at two main things:

One large study compared two groups. One group got chlorhexidine dressing and alcohol to clean the skin. The other group got standard dressing and a different cleaner called povidone-iodine.

Two smaller studies looked at silver-alginate patches. One group got the patch. The other group got no patch.

### How long did the studies last?

The studies followed babies while they had the tubes in their veins.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

**For chlorhexidine dressing with alcohol:**

The dressing did not reduce serious blood infections. It did not reduce sepsis (blood infection without a clear source).

But it did reduce germs growing in the tubes. Out of 100 babies, 9 fewer babies had germs in their tubes. This was compared to babies who got standard care.

However, the chlorhexidine dressing caused skin problems. About 6 out of 100 babies got skin irritation. This is called contact dermatitis. No babies in the standard care group got this problem.

The researchers could not tell if the dressing or the alcohol caused the skin irritation. The standard care group did not use alcohol.

**For silver-alginate patches:**

The patches did not reduce serious blood infections. They did not reduce deaths. But they also did not cause any bad reactions.

### What do the results mean?

Chlorhexidine dressing with alcohol has both good and bad effects. It reduces germs in tubes a little bit. But it causes skin irritation in some babies.

For silver-alginate patches, there is not enough information yet. More research is needed.

### Quality of the evidence

The evidence quality was moderate. The main problem was that the results were not very precise. The range of possible effects was wide.

Also, the people caring for the babies knew which treatment each baby got. This might have affected how they recorded results.

### What do researchers conclude?

Chlorhexidine dressing with alcohol reduces germs in tubes. But it causes skin irritation in many babies. The benefit is small. The risk of skin problems is high.

For silver-alginate patches, more research is needed. We cannot say if they help or harm babies yet.

More studies are needed to find better ways to prevent infections in newborn babies with tubes in their veins."
10.1002-14651858.CD011106.pub2-abstract.txt,"The usefulness of protocols for reducing the time newborn infants spend on mechanical ventilation in the neonatal intensive care unit 
Review question 
Are protocols useful for reducing the time newborn infants spend on mechanical ventilation in the neonatal intensive care unit?  Background 
Mechanical ventilation is used to help newborns to breath when they are too sick or born too premature to breath on their own. However, mechanical ventilation is not without risk, and can cause (permanent) damage to the lungs. For example, the pressure needed to fill the lungs with air may destroy the very fragile air sacs, and result in scaring of the lungs. For this reason, it is important to recognize when a newborn is mature and strong enough to start breathing for himself/herself, and to reduce (wean) the ventilator support. There is, unfortunately, no current agreement on the best way to wean newborns off the ventilator. Researchers have studied the usefulness of standardized protocols to guide the process of weaning off the ventilator in adults and children. In adults, 17 studies of weaning protocols have shown benefit in helping the doctors and nurses wean adults off the ventilator in a safe and timely manner. In children, three studies of weaning protocols have shown they are beneficial in reducing time on the ventilator, but the studies were too few to show harms. As yet, we do not know if weaning protocols in neonates provide benefits or harms. However, these standardized protocols have supplied us with firm evidence for their usefulness in weaning from mechanical ventilation in the care of children.  Study characteristics 
The purpose of this review was to look at weaning protocol studies in newborn infants to see if we could draw conclusions on their usefulness for weaning practice in neonatal care.  Key results  We found no studies that involved newborn infants before the 28th day of life. We found two studies with a subpopulation of newborns, but we were not able to extract the data from this subgroup out of the total group studied.  Quality of evidence 
There is currently no evidence comparing protocolized and non‐protocolized weaning in newborn infants in the neonatal intensive care unit. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Do step-by-step plans help newborn babies come off breathing machines faster?

## Rationale

### What is the health problem?
Some newborn babies cannot breathe on their own. This happens when they are born too early or are very sick. These babies need a breathing machine to help them. Doctors call this machine a ventilator.

### Why is this a problem?
Breathing machines can hurt a baby's lungs. The air pressure from the machine can damage tiny air sacs in the lungs. This damage can leave scars on the lungs that last forever. Because of this risk, doctors need to take babies off the breathing machine as soon as it is safe to do so.

### What did researchers want to learn?
Doctors do not agree on the best way to take babies off breathing machines. Each doctor may do this differently. Researchers wanted to know if using a step-by-step plan would help. These plans are called protocols. They tell doctors and nurses exactly what steps to follow.

### Why might a step-by-step plan help?
Studies in adults showed that these plans work well. Seventeen studies found that plans helped adults come off breathing machines safely and quickly. Three studies in children also showed good results. Children spent less time on breathing machines when doctors used a plan. Researchers wanted to see if the same plans would help newborn babies.

## Trial Design

### How did researchers look for answers?
Researchers searched for studies about newborn babies. They wanted to find studies that compared two groups. One group would use a step-by-step plan. The other group would not use a plan. They looked for studies with babies less than 28 days old. These babies would be in a newborn intensive care unit.

### What did they find?
Researchers found no studies that met their needs. They could not find any studies that tested step-by-step plans in newborn babies. They did find two studies that included some newborn babies. But these studies mixed newborns with older babies. The researchers could not separate the newborn data from the rest.

## Results

### What were the main findings?
There are no studies to answer this question yet. Researchers cannot say if step-by-step plans help newborn babies or not. They cannot say if these plans are safe or unsafe for newborns.

### What does this mean?
More research is needed. Doctors still do not know the best way to take newborn babies off breathing machines. Step-by-step plans work well for adults and children. But no one has tested them properly in newborn babies yet.

### What should happen next?
Scientists need to do new studies with newborn babies. These studies should compare babies who use a plan with babies who do not. Only then can doctors know if these plans help newborn babies come off breathing machines faster and more safely.

### Why is this important?
Every day a baby spends on a breathing machine increases the risk of lung damage. Finding the safest and fastest way to take babies off these machines could help protect their lungs. This could help babies be healthier as they grow up.

10.1002-14651858.CD011345.pub2-abstract.txt,"Timed intercourse for couples with subfertility
Review question 
Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence about the effect of timed intercourse versus spontaneous intercourse in couples trying to conceive. 
Background 
Many couples find it difficult to achieve a pregnancy and have concerns about their fertility. Each cycle, a woman is fertile from approximately five days before ovulation until several hours after ovulation, due to limited survival times of the sperm and egg. Therefore, prospectively identifying this fertile period of a woman's menstrual cycle, to guide timing of intercourse, may improve conception rates. This may reduce unnecessary medical treatment and costs of advanced infertility treatment, but could also cause adverse events such as stress. The fertile period can be identified by different methods including urinary fertility monitoring, calendar charting, observing changes in cervical mucous and basal body temperatures or follicular maturation on ultrasound. The aim of this review was to assess the benefits and risks of timed intercourse on pregnancy outcomes in couples trying to conceive. 
Study characteristics 
We found five randomised controlled trials comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction, in a total of 2840 women or couples trying to conceive. The evidence was current to August 2014. 
Key results 
One large included study (1453 women) has not published usable results and could therefore not be analysed. One study reported live birth rates and found no evidence of a difference; however, the study was too small to have any clinical value. Only one study reported levels of stress and showed no evidence of a difference between timed intercourse with urinary fertility monitoring and intercourse without urinary fertility monitoring. No other adverse events were reported. Only two studies reported clinical pregnancy rates, and showed no evidence of a difference in pregnancy rates in couples with subfertility. The evidence suggested that if the chance of a clinical pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction was assumed to be 16%, the chance of a clinical pregnancy following timed intercourse would be between 9% and 33%. However, if including self‐reported pregnancies (not confirmed by ultrasound), pregnancy rates were higher after timed intercourse. The evidence suggested that if the chance of a pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction was 13%, the chance following timed intercourse would be between 14% and 23%. 
No difference in effect was found between couples trying to conceive for less than 12 months versus 12 months or more. One trial reported time to conception data and showed no evidence of a difference in time to conception. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low for all outcomes. The main limitations of the evidence were imprecision, poor reporting of clinically relevant outcomes and a high risk of publication bias, as one large study remains unpublished. Therefore, the findings should be regarded with caution. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Timed Intercourse for Couples Trying to Get Pregnant

## Plain Title
Does timing sex around ovulation help couples get pregnant faster?

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**
Many couples have trouble getting pregnant. This is called subfertility. These couples often worry about whether they can have a baby.

**Why does this matter?**
A woman can only get pregnant during a short time each month. This is called the fertile period. It starts about 5 days before ovulation and ends a few hours after. Ovulation is when an egg is released from the ovary. The egg and sperm only live for a short time. This is why the fertile period is so short.

**What was the main idea being tested?**
Researchers wanted to know if planning sex during the fertile period helps couples get pregnant. This is called timed intercourse. Couples can find their fertile period in different ways. They can use urine tests, track their cycle on a calendar, check body temperature, or look at cervical mucus changes. Some use ultrasound scans.

**Why was this study needed?**
If timed intercourse works, it could help couples get pregnant without medical treatment. This would save money and avoid costly fertility treatments. However, planning sex might also cause stress for couples. Researchers needed to find out if the benefits are worth any possible problems.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at 5 studies. These studies compared two groups of couples:
- One group timed sex around ovulation
- One group had sex without planning around ovulation

**Who was in the studies?**
The studies included 2,840 women or couples trying to get pregnant. All couples had subfertility, meaning they had trouble getting pregnant naturally.

**How long did the studies last?**
The studies followed couples for different lengths of time. Some couples had been trying to get pregnant for less than 12 months. Others had been trying for 12 months or longer.

**Important note:**
One large study with 1,453 women never published its full results. Researchers could not use this study's data.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

**Live births:**
Only one study looked at live births. It found no difference between the two groups. However, this study was too small to give a clear answer.

**Pregnancies confirmed by ultrasound:**
Two studies looked at pregnancies confirmed by doctors using ultrasound. They found no clear difference between groups. If 16 out of 100 couples got pregnant without timing sex, then between 9 and 33 out of 100 couples got pregnant with timed sex.

**All reported pregnancies:**
When researchers counted all pregnancies that couples reported, more couples got pregnant with timed sex. If 13 out of 100 couples got pregnant without timing sex, then between 14 and 23 out of 100 couples got pregnant with timed sex.

**Time to get pregnant:**
One study looked at how long it took to get pregnant. It found no difference between the two groups.

**Stress levels:**
Only one study checked stress levels. It found no difference in stress between couples who timed sex and those who did not.

**Side effects:**
No studies reported other problems or side effects.

**Different types of couples:**
The results were similar for couples trying for less than 12 months and those trying for 12 months or more.

**What does this mean?**
The evidence does not clearly show that timing sex helps couples get pregnant faster. However, the quality of the evidence was low. One large study never published its results. This makes it hard to trust the findings.

**Conclusions:**
More high-quality research is needed. Couples should talk to their doctor about the best approach for them. These results should be viewed with caution until better studies are done."
10.1002-14651858.CD011357.pub2-abstract.txt,"Antibiotics for bacterial infection in the urine in kidney transplant recipients when there are no symptoms 
What is the issue? Bacteria in the urine in kidney transplant recipients when there are no symptoms of urine infection is called asymptomatic bacteriuria. Up to one in two people with a kidney transplant will develop a bacterial infection of the urine (bacteriuria) at some point after transplantation. Bacteriuria with symptoms like fever, chills, painful urination, abdominal pain and blood in urine is a urinary tract infection (UTI). Bacteriuria often occurs without symptoms and it is frequently treated with antibiotics with the idea this might help avoid subsequent UTI. Avoiding UTI might improve patient and transplant survival. However, it is unclear how many people with asymptomatic bacteriuria go on to develop UTI symptoms; whether treatment with antibiotics truly avoids UTI; or whether treatment when asymptomatic improves survival of both patient and kidney. Also, there can be downsides to taking antibiotics. Taking regular antibiotics might mean that bacteria resistant to antibiotics are encouraged, and taking antibiotics might cause diarrhoea and other adverse events. There are also antibiotic costs to consider. This review looked at whether treating with antibiotics is beneficial of harmful. 
What did we do? 
We searched the literature up to September 2017 and identified two studies (212 participants) that were evaluated in this review. These studies compared antibiotics versus no treatment. 
What did we find? The bacterial infection of the urine often persisted, whether antibiotics were given or not. It was uncertain whether antibiotics prevented symptomatic urinary infection or increased the risk of selecting bacteria resistant to antibiotics, because there were too few data and several limitations in the included studies. Also, it was unclear whether the use of antibiotics in case of urinary infection without symptoms reduced the risks of graft rejection, need for hospitalisation due to symptoms of urinary infection, or mortality, or whether antibiotics improved the function of the kidney transplant. One study with 112 participants suggested there were no severe harmful reactions caused by the antibiotic treatment, and non‐severe adverse events appeared to be rare. 
Conclusions It is uncertain whether antibiotics are beneficial in kidney transplant recipients with bacteria in their urine but no symptoms. In one study, participants were assigned to antibiotics or no therapy by a method that was not random (i.e. according to patients' transplant code). In both studies, participants knew which treatment they were receiving (i.e. antibiotics or no therapy), which may have influenced the results. Last, we had not enough data to estimate with precision some effects of antibiotics. More research is needed. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Do Antibiotics Help Kidney Transplant Patients Who Have Bacteria in Their Urine but No Symptoms?

## Rationale

### What is the health problem?
After someone gets a kidney transplant, bacteria can grow in their urine. This happens to up to 1 in 2 people who receive a kidney transplant. When bacteria are in the urine and cause problems like fever, pain when urinating, or blood in urine, this is called a urinary tract infection or UTI. But sometimes bacteria are in the urine without causing any symptoms. This is called asymptomatic bacteriuria. ""Asymptomatic"" means no symptoms. ""Bacteriuria"" means bacteria in the urine.

### Why is this important?
Doctors often give antibiotics to kidney transplant patients who have bacteria in their urine but no symptoms. They hope this will stop a UTI from developing later. They also hope this might help patients and their transplanted kidneys survive longer. However, we do not know if this treatment really works.

### What are the concerns about antibiotics?
Taking antibiotics when you have no symptoms might cause problems. Antibiotics can create bacteria that are resistant to treatment. This means the bacteria become harder to kill. Antibiotics can also cause diarrhea and other side effects. There are also costs to think about.

### Why was this study needed?
Researchers wanted to find out if giving antibiotics to kidney transplant patients with bacteria in their urine but no symptoms helps or harms them.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked for all studies that compared giving antibiotics versus not giving antibiotics to kidney transplant patients with bacteria in their urine but no symptoms. They searched medical records up to September 2017. They found 2 studies with 212 people total.

### Who was in the studies?
The studies included kidney transplant recipients who had bacteria in their urine but felt fine and had no symptoms.

### How long did the studies last?
The studies followed patients for different lengths of time to see what happened.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
The bacteria in the urine often stayed, whether patients took antibiotics or not. The studies could not clearly show if antibiotics prevented UTIs with symptoms. This was because there were not enough people in the studies. The studies also had some problems with how they were done.

### What about antibiotic resistance?
The researchers could not tell if antibiotics increased the risk of creating bacteria that resist treatment. Again, there was not enough information.

### What about other important outcomes?
It was unclear if antibiotics helped with:
- Preventing the body from rejecting the transplanted kidney
- Reducing hospital stays for UTI symptoms
- Helping patients live longer
- Helping the transplanted kidney work better

### Were there side effects?
One study with 112 people found no serious harmful reactions from antibiotics. Minor side effects seemed rare.

### What are the main conclusions?
We cannot be sure if antibiotics help kidney transplant patients who have bacteria in their urine but no symptoms. The studies had problems. In one study, patients were not assigned to groups randomly. In both studies, patients knew if they were getting antibiotics or not. This knowledge might have changed the results. Also, the studies were too small to give clear answers.

### What is needed next?
More research is needed to answer this question properly. Larger and better designed studies would help doctors know if they should give antibiotics to these patients."
10.1002-14651858.CD011364.pub2-abstract.txt,"Ultrasound use for insertion of arterial catheters in children
Background 
An arterial catheter is a thin tube or line that can be inserted into an artery. Arterial catheters are used to monitor blood pressure during complex surgeries and during stays in intensive care. Ultrasound imaging (an image created with sound waves of soft tissue) allows anaesthesiologists and intensivists to see surrounding structures. Ultrasound can help medical practitioners accurately locate the artery and insert the catheter, and, particularly when surgeries involve children, ultrasound can prevent the need for multiple needle sticks. This reduces the occurrence of haematoma (a localized collection of blood outside the blood vessels) or damage to the artery, compared with other techniques such as palpation of the artery (feeling through the skin for the pulse) or Doppler auditory assistance (listening for a change to a higher pitch at the exact location of the artery). Our aim was to find out whether ultrasound offers any advantages over palpation of the artery or Doppler auditory assistance. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to January 2016. We found five eligible studies ‐ four comparing ultrasound with palpation and one comparing ultrasound with Doppler auditory assistance. 
Key results 
We included in the review children aged one month to 18 years. We found that ultrasound increased the rate of successful cannulation at the first attempt and reduced the formation of haematomas. Ultrasound also increased the success rate within two attempts. It is likely that ultrasound is more useful for infants and small children than for older children. It is also likely that ultrasound is more useful if the practitioner is experienced in its use. 
Quality of the evidence 
We noted variation in the risk of bias of included studies. We rated the quality of evidence as moderate mainly because the number of studies was limited. For the same reason, we could not confirm the effect of age and expertise in ultrasound usage. 
Conclusions 
Our evidence suggests that ultrasound is superior to other techniques for arterial catheter insertion, particularly in babies and young children. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Using Ultrasound to Help Doctors Insert Tubes into Arteries in Children

## Rationale

### What is an arterial catheter and why is it needed?
An arterial catheter is a very thin tube. Doctors put this tube into an artery (a blood vessel). The tube helps doctors watch blood pressure during surgery. It also helps when children stay in intensive care.

### What is the problem?
Putting the tube into an artery can be hard in children. Doctors need to find the artery first. Sometimes they have to try many times with a needle. This can hurt the child. It can cause bleeding under the skin. This bleeding is called a haematoma. It can also damage the artery.

### How do doctors usually find the artery?
Doctors use two main ways:
- They feel for the pulse through the skin
- They use a special tool that makes sounds to find the artery

### What is ultrasound?
Ultrasound uses sound waves to make pictures. These pictures show what is inside the body. Doctors can see the artery on the screen. This helps them know exactly where to put the needle.

### Why was this study needed?
Researchers wanted to know if ultrasound works better than the other two ways. They wanted to see if ultrasound helps doctors succeed on the first try. They also wanted to know if ultrasound causes fewer problems.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked at five different studies. Four studies compared ultrasound with feeling for the pulse. One study compared ultrasound with the sound tool.

### Who was in the studies?
The studies included children from one month old to 18 years old. These children needed arterial catheters for surgery or intensive care.

### What did researchers compare?
They looked at how often doctors succeeded on the first try. They counted how many tries it took. They also looked for problems like bleeding under the skin.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
Ultrasound helped doctors succeed more often on the first try. Ultrasound also caused less bleeding under the skin. When doctors used ultrasound, they usually succeeded within two tries.

### Who benefits most from ultrasound?
Babies and young children benefit most. Ultrasound seems to help more with smaller children than older children.

### Does doctor experience matter?
Yes. Doctors who know how to use ultrasound well get better results. Practice with ultrasound is important.

### How good is this evidence?
The researchers rated the evidence as moderate quality. They only found five studies to review. More studies would make the evidence stronger. Because there were few studies, researchers could not be completely sure about age and experience effects.

### What do the researchers conclude?
Ultrasound works better than other methods for putting tubes into arteries. This is especially true for babies and young children. Ultrasound helps doctors succeed faster. It causes fewer problems. Children need fewer needle sticks. This means less pain and fewer complications.

### Why does this matter?
When doctors use ultrasound, children have better experiences. The procedure is safer. It works better the first time. There is less chance of bleeding or damage. This is important for children who need surgery or intensive care.

### What comes next?
More studies could help doctors understand ultrasound benefits even better. Future research could show exactly which ages benefit most. It could also show how much practice doctors need with ultrasound."
10.1002-14651858.CD011391.pub2-abstract.txt,"Key‐hole (laparoscopic) versus standard access (open) abdominal operation for people with pancreatic cancer 
Review question 
How does key‐hole (laparoscopic) abdominal surgery compare with standard access (open) abdominal operation for people with pancreatic cancer? 
Background 
The pancreas is an organ in the abdomen that secretes pancreatic juice that aids digestion and contains cells that produce important hormones such as insulin. The pancreas can be divided into the head of the pancreas (right part of the pancreas) and the body and tail of the pancreas (left part or distal part of the pancreas). Distal pancreatic cancer is cancer of the body and/or tail of the pancreas. Removal of distal pancreatic cancer by surgery (distal pancreatectomy) is the preferred treatment for people with distal pancreatic cancers limited to the pancreas who are likely to withstand major surgery, because no other treatments have the potential to cure pancreatic cancer. Cancer can be removed through an abdominal operation, either laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy or open distal pancreatectomy. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is a relatively new procedure as compared with the well‐established open distal pancreatectomy. In operations on other parts of the body, laparoscopic surgery has been shown to reduce complications and length of hospital stay as compared with open surgery. However, concerns remain about the safety of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy in terms of complications after operation (postoperative complications). In addition, it is not clear whether laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy achieves the same amount of cancer clearance as is attained by open distal pancreatectomy. It also is not clear whether laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is better than open distal pancreatectomy in terms of earlier recovery after operation. We sought to resolve this issue by searching the medical literature for studies on this topic until June 2015. 
Study characteristics 
No randomised controlled trials have examined this topic. Randomised controlled trials are the best studies for finding out whether one treatment is better or worse than another because they ensure that similar types of people are receiving the treatments being assessed. In the absence of randomised controlled trials, we sought information from non‐randomised studies. We identified 12 non‐randomised studies that compared laparoscopic versus open distal pancreatectomy in a total of 1576 patients. One of these studies did not provide results in a useable way. Thus, we included 11 studies in which a total of 1506 patients underwent distal pancreatectomy. Some 353 patients underwent laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy, and 1153 patients underwent open distal pancreatectomy. In all studies, historical information was collected from hospital records (retrospective studies). In general, historical information is less reliable than newly collected (prospective) information and findings of randomised controlled trials. 
Key results 
Differences in short‐term deaths, long‐term deaths, percentage of people with major complications, percentage of people with a pancreatic fistula (abnormal communication between the pancreas and other organs or the skin), recurrence of cancer at final time of follow‐up of participants, percentage of people with any complications and percentage of patients in whom cancer was not completely removed were imprecise. Average length of hospital stay was shorter in the laparoscopic group than in the open group by about two days. However, this is not relevant until we can be sure that cancer cures are similar between laparoscopic surgery and open surgery. No studies have reported quality of life at any point in time, short‐term recurrence of cancer, time to return to normal activity, time to return to work or blood transfusion requirements. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was very low, mainly because it was not clear whether similar types of participants received laparoscopic and open distal pancreatectomy. In many studies, people with less extensive cancer received laparoscopic surgery, and those with more extensive cancer received open surgery. This makes study findings unreliable. Well‐designed randomised controlled trials are necessary if we are to obtain good quality evidence on this topic. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Comparing Keyhole Surgery to Standard Surgery for Pancreatic Cancer

## Rationale

**What is the pancreas and what does it do?**
The pancreas is an organ in your belly. It makes juices that help you digest food. It also makes important hormones like insulin.

**What is pancreatic cancer?**
The pancreas has two main parts. The right side is called the head. The left side is called the body and tail. Cancer can grow in any of these parts. This study looked at cancer in the body and tail of the pancreas.

**Why is this condition a problem?**
Pancreatic cancer is very serious. Surgery to remove the cancer is the best treatment option. This is the only treatment that might cure the disease. The surgery is called distal pancreatectomy. Doctors only offer this surgery to people who are healthy enough for major surgery. They also only offer it when the cancer has not spread beyond the pancreas.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors can remove pancreatic cancer in two ways. The standard way is open surgery. This uses one large cut in the belly. The newer way is keyhole surgery. This is also called laparoscopic surgery. It uses several small cuts instead of one large cut.

Keyhole surgery has helped patients with other health problems. It often causes fewer problems after surgery. Patients often go home from the hospital sooner. However, doctors are not sure if keyhole surgery is safe for pancreatic cancer. They also do not know if it removes cancer as well as open surgery does.

**What did researchers want to find out?**
Researchers wanted to know if keyhole surgery works as well as open surgery. They wanted to compare how safe each surgery is. They also wanted to know which surgery helps patients recover faster.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**
This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at information from past studies. They searched medical records until June 2015. They wanted to find the best type of study. This is called a randomized controlled trial. In these studies, patients are put into groups by chance. This makes sure similar patients get each treatment.

**What did the researchers find?**
The researchers could not find any randomized controlled trials. Instead, they found 12 studies that looked back at hospital records. These are called retrospective studies. The researchers could use information from 11 of these studies.

**Who was in these studies?**
A total of 1,506 patients were in the 11 studies. Of these patients, 353 had keyhole surgery. The other 1,153 patients had open surgery. All patients had cancer in the body or tail of the pancreas.

**What is important to know about this design?**
Information from hospital records is not as reliable as new information. The studies did not use chance to put patients into groups. This means different types of patients may have gotten each surgery. In many studies, patients with less serious cancer got keyhole surgery. Patients with more serious cancer got open surgery. This makes it hard to compare the two surgeries fairly.

## Results

**What were the main results?**
The researchers could not find clear differences between the two surgeries for most outcomes. The results were not precise enough to be sure. This included:
- Deaths soon after surgery
- Deaths in the long term
- Serious problems after surgery
- Leaking from the pancreas after surgery
- Cancer coming back
- Any problems after surgery
- Cancer left behind after surgery

**What difference did the researchers find?**
Patients who had keyhole surgery went home about two days sooner. However, this finding may not be important. Doctors first need to be sure that keyhole surgery cures cancer as well as open surgery does.

**What information was missing?**
No studies reported several important things. These included quality of life, cancer coming back in the short term, time to return to normal activities, time to return to work, and need for blood transfusions.

**What do the results mean?**
The quality of evidence was very low. The researchers could not tell if keyhole surgery is as good as open surgery. The studies were not designed well enough to answer this question. Better studies are needed. These should be randomized controlled trials. In these studies, chance would decide which surgery each patient gets. This would make the comparison fair and reliable."
10.1002-14651858.CD011462.pub2-abstract.txt,"Use of shorter radiation treatments for prostate cancer
Review question 
We asked if giving radiation therapy (cancer treatment with high energy x‐rays) for localized prostate cancer in fewer fractions (treatment visits for radiation) and shorter overall treatment time with a larger dose (more than 2 Gray) given each day, works as well as the usual (conventional) number of fractions (1.8 Gray per day to 2 Gray per day) for cancer control and had similar side effects. 
Background 
Using fewer fractions, with a larger dose given at each visit is possibly better for treating prostate cancer with radiation. Radiation therapy for prostate cancer can cause bladder and bowel side effects, and affect sexual function. If using larger doses for each treatment, with fewer treatments overall (called hypofractionation), works as well for cancer control, and the side effects and effects on certainty of life are about the same, then hypofractionation may benefit men with prostate cancer contained within the prostate (localized) who are treated with radiation therapy. If cancer control is as good, and the side effects about the same, then using fewer (but larger dose) radiation treatments may be more convenient for men with prostate cancer, use fewer resources and save money. 
Study characteristics 
This evidence is current to 15 March 2019. The men studied were ages 64 years and over and had prostate cancer limited to the pelvis. 
Key results 
We studied the use of fewer, but larger doses of radiation to treat 8278 men with prostate cancer. We found 10 studies. 
We found that using hypofractionation may result in similar risk of dying from prostate cancer (low‐certainty evidence) but are uncertain how it affects late bowel side effects (very low‐certainty evidence). It probably results in similar rates of late bladder side effects (moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Using hypofractionation results in similar overall survival (high‐certainty evidence) and may be similar for metastasis‐free survival (low‐certainty evidence). Acute bladder side effects may be similar (moderate‐certainty evidence). 
","# Plain Language Summary: Shorter Radiation Treatment for Prostate Cancer

## Plain Title
Can Men with Prostate Cancer Get Fewer Radiation Treatments That Work Just as Well?

## Rationale

**What is prostate cancer and why does it matter?**

Prostate cancer is a disease that affects the prostate gland in men. When the cancer stays only in the prostate, doctors call it ""localized."" This means it has not spread to other parts of the body.

**How is prostate cancer treated?**

Doctors often use radiation therapy to treat prostate cancer. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. Men usually visit the hospital many times to get small doses of radiation each day. This is called conventional treatment.

**What problem were researchers trying to solve?**

The usual radiation treatment takes many weeks. Men must go to the hospital almost every day. This takes a lot of time and can be hard for patients and their families.

Radiation can also cause side effects. It may cause problems with the bladder or bowel. It can also affect how the sexual organs work.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to know if giving larger doses of radiation in fewer visits works just as well. This is called hypofractionation. With this approach, men would need fewer trips to the hospital.

The researchers wanted to see if this shorter treatment:
- Controls cancer just as well
- Causes about the same side effects
- Helps men live just as long

If fewer treatments work just as well, this would be easier for patients. It would also cost less and use fewer hospital resources.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 10 different studies. They combined the results to get a bigger picture.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included 8,278 men total. These men were 64 years old or older. All had prostate cancer that had not spread beyond the pelvis area.

**What did the studies compare?**

The studies compared two types of radiation treatment:
- Conventional treatment: Small doses (1.8 to 2 Gray) given each day for many weeks
- Hypofractionation: Larger doses (more than 2 Gray) given each day for fewer weeks

**How long did the studies last?**

The researchers looked at data collected up to March 15, 2019. They tracked how the men did over time after their treatment.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found that shorter treatment with larger doses works about as well as conventional treatment.

**Cancer control:**
- Men who got fewer, larger doses had similar rates of dying from prostate cancer
- Men lived about the same length of time overall
- The cancer was about as likely to spread in both groups

**Side effects:**
- Late bladder side effects (problems that show up months or years later) were probably about the same
- Bladder side effects that happen during treatment may be similar
- The researchers were not sure about late bowel side effects

**How strong is this evidence?**

Some findings were very strong. The evidence about overall survival was high quality. This means researchers are confident in this result.

Other findings were less certain. The evidence about bowel side effects was very low quality. More research is needed in this area.

**What does this mean for patients?**

Men with localized prostate cancer can likely get fewer radiation treatments safely. The shorter treatment schedule appears to work just as well. Side effects seem to be about the same.

**Why does this matter?**

Fewer hospital visits make treatment easier for patients and families. It saves time and money. It also frees up hospital resources for other patients.

**What are the main conclusions?**

Using fewer, larger doses of radiation appears to be a good option for men with localized prostate cancer. It controls cancer about as well as conventional treatment. Most side effects appear similar. Patients may prefer this because it requires fewer trips to the hospital."

Review question: Does antithrombin reduce the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (i.e. bleeding in the brain) and mortality in very preterm infants? 
Background: Antithrombin is a drug that modulates blood coagulation together with other factors. Very low birth weight newborn infants (i.e. those neonates with a gestational age less than 32 weeks) have low level of antithrombin in the blood. On the basis of an observational study in very preterm infants, it has been suggested that the administration of drugs that prevent clotting (anticoagulants) such as antithrombin may reduce the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage and progression of intraventricular hemorrhage, a frequent complication of preterm neonates. This systematic review synthesizes the available evidence on the effectiveness of antithrombin in preventing intraventricular hemorrhage in very preterm neonates. 
Study characteristics: We included two trials for a total of 182 newborn infants comparing antithrombin with placebo (sugar or albumin solution). 
Results: The use of antithrombin does not reduce the risks of bleeding in the brain, mortality or any other relevant outcomes in very preterm neonates when compared to placebo. However, the data collected are too limited to draw definitive conclusions on the use of antithrombin in the prevention of intraventricular hemorrhage (i.e. bleeding in the brain). 
Conclusions: The results of this systematic review are consistent with either a benefit or a detrimental effect of antithrombin and do not provide a definitive answer to the review question.

## Plain Title
Does a Blood-Thinning Drug Called Antithrombin Help Prevent Brain Bleeding in Babies Born Very Early?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some babies are born very early, before 32 weeks of pregnancy. These babies are called very preterm infants. They often have serious health problems because their bodies are not fully developed yet.

One common problem is bleeding in the brain. Doctors call this intraventricular hemorrhage. This bleeding happens inside the baby's brain and can cause lasting harm or even death.

**Why does this problem happen?**

Very preterm babies have low levels of a natural substance in their blood called antithrombin. Antithrombin helps control how blood clots. When babies don't have enough antithrombin, they may have more bleeding problems.

**Why was this study needed?**

Earlier research suggested that giving antithrombin to very preterm babies might help prevent brain bleeding. Antithrombin is a drug that helps stop blood clots from forming. Researchers wanted to find out if this drug really works to protect these tiny babies from brain bleeding.

This study reviewed all available research to see if antithrombin is helpful for very preterm babies.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a systematic review. This means researchers looked at all the studies done on this topic. They combined the results to get a clearer answer.

**Who was in the studies?**

The review included two studies with 182 babies total. All babies were born very early, before 32 weeks of pregnancy. These babies had very low birth weight.

**What did the studies compare?**

Some babies received antithrombin. Other babies received a placebo. A placebo is a substance with no medicine in it. In these studies, the placebo was either sugar water or albumin solution.

Researchers then compared the two groups of babies. They looked to see which group had fewer problems.

**What did researchers measure?**

Researchers looked at several things:
- How many babies had bleeding in the brain
- How many babies died
- Other health problems the babies had

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The studies showed that antithrombin did not help prevent brain bleeding in very preterm babies. Babies who got antithrombin did not do better than babies who got placebo.

Antithrombin also did not reduce the number of babies who died. It did not improve any other health outcomes either.

**What does this mean?**

The researchers could not prove that antithrombin helps very preterm babies. But they also could not prove that it causes harm.

**Why are the results unclear?**

Only two small studies were available. Only 182 babies were included in total. This is not enough babies to give a clear answer.

More research with more babies is needed. Only then can doctors know for sure if antithrombin helps or not.

**What do the researchers conclude?**

The evidence is too limited to make a final decision. Antithrombin might help, or it might not help, or it might even cause harm. Right now, doctors cannot say for certain.

More and larger studies are needed before doctors can recommend using antithrombin to prevent brain bleeding in very preterm babies.

**Why is this important?**

Brain bleeding is a serious problem for babies born very early. Finding ways to prevent it could save lives and prevent lasting brain damage. However, this study shows that antithrombin is not proven to work yet. Doctors need better evidence before using this treatment."
10.1002-14651858.CD011681-abstract.txt,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for preventing tension‐type headache 
Tension‐type headache is a common type of headache that can significantly impair people's quality of life. Individuals who experience frequent or severe headaches may benefit from medications taken before the pain starts. Two classes of medication, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), typically used to treat depression, are evaluated in this review. 
This is an update of a previous review that included studies on migraine and tension‐type headache. The original review has been split into two separate reviews: this update addresses only studies on tension‐type headache, while a second focuses on migraine. When we updated this review (November 2014), we identified two new studies. Six studies were already included in the previous version of the review. Overall, we analysed a total of 412 adults participants. All the studies had a small number of participants and were conducted over a period of two to four months. Only a few were of high quality. 
Results suggest that SSRIs or SNRIs are no better than placebo (sugar pill) in reducing the number of days with tension‐type headache. There were no differences in minor side effects between participants treated with SSRIs or SNRIs versus those treated with placebo. SSRIs and SNRIs do not seem to offer advantages when compared to other active treatments, specifically the tricyclic antidepressant, amitriptyline. The participants treated with SSRIs or SNRIs suffered fewer minor side effects than those who took amitriptyline, however the number of people who stopped taking one drug or the other due to side effects was approximately equal. These results are based on poor quality, small, short‐term trials (no more than four months). We did not find a study comparing SSRIs or SNRIs with other medications (e.g. botulinum toxin) or non‐drug therapies (e.g. psycho‐behavioural treatments, manual therapy, acupuncture). 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Do SSRI and SNRI Antidepressants Prevent Tension-Type Headaches?

## Rationale

Tension-type headache is a common kind of head pain. Many people get these headaches. They can make daily life harder. People may have trouble working or doing things they enjoy.

Some people get tension-type headaches often. These people may need medicine to stop the headaches before they start. This is different from taking medicine after the pain begins.

Doctors sometimes use medicines called SSRIs and SNRIs. These medicines are usually given to treat depression. Depression is a condition that makes people feel very sad. Researchers wanted to know if these same medicines could also prevent tension-type headaches.

The study was needed because people with frequent headaches need better treatment options. If SSRIs and SNRIs work for headaches, doctors would have more ways to help their patients.

## Trial Design

This study looked at research that other scientists had already done. The researchers collected information from eight different studies. They combined the results to see what worked.

The studies included 412 adults total. All participants had tension-type headaches. The studies did not include children.

Each study was short. They lasted between two months and four months. This means researchers watched the participants for a short time only.

The studies compared different treatments. Some people took SSRIs or SNRIs. Other people took a placebo. A placebo is a sugar pill with no medicine in it. Some people took a different medicine called amitriptyline. Amitriptyline is an older type of antidepressant.

Most of the studies were small. They did not have many participants. Only a few studies were high quality. High quality means the study was done carefully and the results are more trustworthy.

## Results

The main results showed that SSRIs and SNRIs did not work well for tension-type headaches.

People who took SSRIs or SNRIs had the same number of headache days as people who took the placebo. This means these medicines were no better than a sugar pill.

The researchers also compared SSRIs and SNRIs to amitriptyline. Amitriptyline is another medicine sometimes used for headaches. SSRIs and SNRIs did not work better than amitriptyline.

Both types of medicine caused side effects. Side effects are unwanted problems that medicine can cause. People taking SSRIs or SNRIs had fewer minor side effects than people taking amitriptyline. Minor side effects might include dry mouth or feeling sleepy.

However, about the same number of people stopped taking each medicine because of side effects. This means the side effects bothered people equally, even though they were different.

The researchers could not find studies comparing SSRIs or SNRIs to other treatments. These other treatments might include shots of botulinum toxin, talk therapy, massage, or acupuncture.

The conclusions are limited. The studies were small and short. Better studies are needed. These studies should be larger and last longer. They should compare SSRIs and SNRIs to more treatment options.

For now, the evidence suggests that SSRIs and SNRIs do not help prevent tension-type headaches. People with frequent tension-type headaches should talk to their doctor about other treatment options that may work better."
10.1002-14651858.CD011683.pub2-abstract.txt,"Targeted mass media interventions to encourage healthier behaviours in adult, ethnic minorities 
Background and review question 
Health authorities and non‐governmental organisations often use mass media interventions (e.g. leaflets, radio and TV advertisements, posters and social media) to encourage healthier behaviours related to physical activity, dietary patterns, tobacco use or alcohol consumption, among others. In this review, we consider the effects of mass media interventions targeted towards ethnic minorities. A targeted intervention is designed for and considers the characteristics of a specific group, ideally providing ethnic minority groups equal opportunities and resources to access information, life skills, and opportunities to make healthier choices. However, we do not know whether targeted mass media strategies are more effective in reaching and influencing ethnic minorities than mass media strategies developed for the general population. 
Study characteristics 
We found six studies, all from the USA, four of which targeted African Americans and two which targeted Latino or Chinese immigrants. Of the studies, four were experimental (1693 volunteers) and two reported the results of large, targeted campaigns run in whole communities and cities. The evidence is current to August 2016. 
Key results 
The available evidence is insufficient to conclude whether targeted mass media interventions for ethnic minority groups are more, less or equally effective in changing health behaviours than general mass media interventions. Only one study compared participants' smoking habits and intentions to quit following the receipt of either a culturally adapted smoking advice booklet or a booklet developed for the general population. They found little or no differences in smoking behaviours between the groups. 
When compared to no mass media intervention, a targeted mass media intervention may increase the number of calls to smoking quit lines, but the effect on health behaviours is unclear. This conclusion is based on findings from three studies. One study gave participants access to a series of 12 live shows on cable TV with information on how to maintain a healthy weight through diet and physical activity. Compared to women who did not watch the shows, participants reported slightly increased physical activity and some positive changes to their dietary patterns; however, their body weight was no different over time. Two other studies were large‐scale targeted campaigns in which smokers were encouraged to call a quit line for smoking cessation advice. The number of telephone calls from the target population increased considerably during the campaign. 
This review also compared targeted mass media interventions versus mass media interventions with added personal interactions. These findings, based on three studies, were inconclusive. 
None of the studies reported whether the interventions could have had any adverse effects, such as possible stigmatisation or increased resistance to messages. 
Further studies directly comparing targeted mass media interventions with general mass media interventions would be useful. Few studies have investigated the effects of targeted mass media interventions for ethnic minority groups who primarily speak a non‐dominant language. 
Quality of the evidence 
Our confidence in the evidence of effect on all main outcomes is low to very low. This means that the true effect may be different or substantially different from the results presented in this review. We have moderate confidence in the estimated increase in the number of calls to smoking quit lines. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Can Health Messages Designed for Specific Ethnic Groups Help People Make Healthier Choices?

## Rationale

Health groups often use media like TV ads, posters, leaflets, and social media to help people live healthier lives. These messages may focus on eating better, being more active, quitting smoking, or drinking less alcohol.

Some health messages are made for everyone. Other messages are designed for specific ethnic groups. These targeted messages consider the culture, language, and needs of that group. The goal is to give all people equal access to health information.

Researchers wanted to know if targeted messages work better for ethnic minority groups. Do messages made just for them help more than general messages? This study tried to answer that question.

Understanding this matters because ethnic minority groups may face extra challenges in getting health information. They may speak different languages or have different cultural beliefs. Messages that fit their needs might help them make healthier choices.

## Trial Design

Researchers looked for studies that tested health messages aimed at ethnic minority groups. They searched for research published up to August 2016.

They found six studies, all done in the United States. Four studies focused on African Americans. Two studies focused on Latino or Chinese immigrants.

Four studies were experiments with 1,693 volunteers total. Two studies looked at large campaigns that reached whole communities and cities.

The studies tested different types of health messages. Some were about quitting smoking. Others were about eating better and being more active. Some used booklets, while others used TV shows or large advertising campaigns.

The length of time people were in these studies varied by project.

## Results

**Main Findings:**

The researchers could not tell if targeted health messages work better than general messages. Only one study directly compared the two types. That study gave smokers either a booklet made for their ethnic group or a regular booklet. Both groups had similar smoking habits afterward. There was little or no difference between them.

When researchers compared targeted messages to no messages at all, they found mixed results. Targeted messages might help in some ways but not others.

One study showed women a TV series about healthy eating and exercise. Women who watched reported being slightly more active. They also made some better food choices. However, their body weight did not change.

Two large campaigns encouraged smokers to call phone help lines for quitting advice. Many more people from the target groups called during these campaigns. This suggests the messages reached the right people.

However, none of the studies showed clear proof that these messages actually changed health behaviors long-term.

**Important Gaps:**

None of the studies checked for possible harm. For example, targeted messages might make some people feel singled out. Or people might resist messages they see as not for them.

Most studies did not focus on people who speak languages other than English. This is an important gap.

**Quality of Evidence:**

The researchers have low to very low confidence in most findings. This means the true effects might be quite different from what these studies showed. They have moderate confidence that targeted campaigns increased calls to quit lines.

**Conclusions:**

More research is needed. Future studies should directly compare targeted messages with general messages. Studies should include people who speak different languages. Researchers should also watch for any negative effects of targeted messages.

Right now, we cannot say whether making special health messages for ethnic groups works better than using general messages for everyone."
10.1002-14651858.CD011716.pub2-abstract.txt,"Use of oxygen during activities for people with lung scarring conditions
Review question 
Should oxygen be used for people with lung scarring conditions, known as interstitial lung disease (ILD), whose oxygen levels drop when they exercise? 
Background 
Many people with ILD have a drop in their oxygen levels when they are moving about. This is because of their lung scarring. Oxygen can be given, to be used only when people are moving about, to prevent this drop. This is called ambulatory oxygen. This may help to improve symptoms of breathlessness and their ability to exercise. It may also improve their quality of life. This Cochrane review examined the evidence for any effect of ambulatory oxygen on the ability to exercise, breathlessness and quality of life. Cochrane researchers searched the available evidence up to 4th May 2016. 
Study characteristics and key results 
We included only three studies, which had a total of 98 participants with ILD. All three studies compared the effects of both oxygen and air in all participants while they did an exercise test, while preventing them from knowing which treatment they were being given. Two studies showed no helpful effects on the ability to exercise or on symptoms of breathlessness. One study showed that participants could exercise for longer with oxygen. None of these studies looked at the effect of oxygen on quality of life, survival, the cost of oxygen treatment or its effects on hospital admissions. No adverse events were reported in any of the studies. 
We also looked for studies of oxygen given after exercise in people with ILD (""short burst oxygen""), but did not find any studies. 
Quality of the evidence 
There were some problems with the way these studies were conducted. The included studies were small. Also, two studies did not make sure that the amount of oxygen given was enough to prevent a drop in oxygen levels when the participants were exercising. This could mean that they were not given enough oxygen. The overall quality of evidence in this review was low. 
Conclusions 
We cannot tell from these studies if ambulatory oxygen is helpful in people with ILD. More research is needed, which should look at the effect of ambulatory oxygen on exercise, breathlessness and also on quality of life in people with ILD. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Using Oxygen During Activities for People with Lung Scarring

## Plain Title
Does Using Oxygen During Activity Help People with Lung Scarring?

## Rationale

**What is lung scarring?**
Some people have a health problem called lung scarring. Doctors call this interstitial lung disease, or ILD. The lungs get stiff and scarred. This makes it hard to breathe.

**What problems does lung scarring cause?**
When people with lung scarring move around or exercise, their oxygen levels drop. This happens because their lungs cannot work as well. Low oxygen can make people feel very short of breath. It can make it hard to do daily tasks.

**What is ambulatory oxygen?**
Ambulatory oxygen is oxygen that people use only when they are active or moving around. People carry it with them. The goal is to keep oxygen levels from dropping too low during activity.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors wanted to know if using oxygen during activity could help people with lung scarring. They thought it might help people breathe easier. It might help them exercise longer. It might also make their quality of life better. This review looked at all the research studies to find out if ambulatory oxygen really helps.

## Trial Design

**How was this review designed?**
Researchers looked for all studies about oxygen use during activity in people with lung scarring. They searched for studies up to May 4, 2016.

**What studies did they find?**
They found only 3 studies. These studies had 98 people total. All the people had lung scarring.

**How were the studies done?**
All 3 studies tested both oxygen and regular air in the same people. The people did exercise tests. They did not know if they were breathing oxygen or regular air. This helped make the test fair. Researchers then compared the results.

**What did the studies measure?**
The studies looked at how long people could exercise. They looked at how short of breath people felt. They wanted to see if oxygen made a difference.

## Results

**What did the studies find?**
The results were mixed. Two studies found no helpful effects. People did not exercise longer with oxygen. They did not feel less short of breath. One study found that people could exercise longer when using oxygen.

**What did the studies NOT look at?**
None of the studies looked at quality of life. They did not look at how long people lived. They did not look at the cost of oxygen treatment. They did not look at hospital visits.

**Were there any safety problems?**
No. The studies reported no harmful effects from using oxygen.

**What about oxygen used after exercise?**
Researchers also looked for studies about ""short burst oxygen."" This is oxygen used right after exercise, not during it. They found no studies about this.

**What were the problems with these studies?**
There were several problems. The studies were very small. Only 98 people total took part. Two studies may not have given enough oxygen. The oxygen amount might not have been enough to prevent oxygen levels from dropping. This means the test may not have been done correctly. Because of these problems, the quality of evidence was low.

**What do the results mean?**
We cannot tell from these studies if oxygen during activity really helps people with lung scarring. The studies were too small. They had too many problems. We need better research to know the answer.

**What research is needed?**
More and larger studies are needed. These studies should make sure people get enough oxygen. They should look at how far people can walk or exercise. They should measure how short of breath people feel. They should also look at quality of life. This would help doctors know if oxygen during activity really helps people with lung scarring."
10.1002-14651858.CD011723.pub2-abstract.txt,"Mindfulness‐based interventions for substance use disorders
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to determine whether mindfulness‐based interventions (MBIs) i.e. interventions involving training in mindfulness meditation improve symptoms of substance use disorders (SUDs) (i.e. alcohol and/or drug use, but excluding tobacco use disorders). Cochrane researchers searched, selected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer this question. We found 40 randomized controlled trials,that assessed MBI as a treatment for SUDs. 
Key messages 
SUD outcomes were monitored at different time points: directly following completion of the MBIs, and at follow‐up time points, which ranged from 3 months to 10 months after the MBI ended. Relative to other interventions (standard of care, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychoeducation, support group, physical exercise, medication), MBIs may slightly reduce days with substance use, but it is very uncertain whether they reduce other SUD‐related outcomes. The effects of MBIs relative to no treatment was very uncertain across all SUD‐assessed outcomes, as was the risk for adverse events. 
What was studied in this review? 
SUDs are very common and associated with negative physical and psychological health outcomes. Although evidence‐based interventions exist for treating SUDs, the standard treatments may not be sufficient and many individuals relapse to substance use. In the past several decades, MBIs have been examined for the treatment of SUDs. MBIs involve training in mindfulness meditation practice, which emphasizes the cultivation of present‐moment, non‐judgmental awareness. MBIs may improve many of the psychological variables involved in substance use and relapse (i.e. depression, anxiety, stress, attention). We studied whether MBIs benefit individuals with SUDs. 
We searched for studies that compared an MBI to no treatment or to another treatment (e.g. cognitive behavior therapy, psychoeducation). We studied the results at the end of the intervention and at follow‐up assessments, which occurred 3 to 10 months following the end of the intervention. 
What are the main results of this review? 
The review authors found 40 relevant studies, of which 45% were focused on individuals with various SUDs with the remaining studies including participants using a specific substance (e.g. alcohol, opioids). Of these 40 studies, 23 were conducted in the USA, 11 were conducted in Iran, two were conducted in Thailand, one was conducted in Brazil, one was conducted in China, one was conducted in Taiwan, and one was conducted in both Spain and the USA. We were able to analyze results of 35 studies composed of 2825 participants; the other five did not report usable results, and requests to the authors for more information were unsuccessful. 
When MBIs were compared with other treatments, our review and analysis showed that MBIs may slightly reduce days with substance use at post‐treatment and follow‐up, and show similar study retention. The evidence is uncertain for other SUD‐related outcomes we assessed (continuous abstinence, consumed amount, craving intensity). When MBIs were compared with no treatment, the evidence was uncertain for all SUD‐related outcomes, although MBIs showed similar treatment retention. Adverse effects were only reported on in four studies. However, the available evidence did not suggest MBIs result in adverse events or serious adverse events. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for studies published up to April 2021.
Study funding sources 
Sixteen studies reported no funding. The remaining studies reported one or more sources of funding and support. Nineteen acknowledged federal sources, seven acknowledged internal grants, four acknowledged non‐profit entities, and two acknowledged clinics. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Mindfulness Meditation for People with Drug or Alcohol Problems

## Plain Title
Can mindfulness meditation help people with drug or alcohol problems?

## Rationale

**What is the problem?**

Many people struggle with drug or alcohol use. These problems are very common. They can harm a person's body and mind. They can make people very sick.

**What treatments exist?**

Doctors have treatments that can help. But these treatments do not work for everyone. Many people start using drugs or alcohol again after treatment. This is called relapse.

**What is mindfulness meditation?**

Mindfulness meditation is a type of training. It teaches people to pay attention to the present moment. People learn to notice their thoughts and feelings without judging them. This practice may help with stress, sadness, worry, and focus.

**Why study mindfulness for drug and alcohol problems?**

Mindfulness may help people with drug or alcohol problems. It might help with the feelings that lead to drug or alcohol use. It might help prevent relapse. Researchers wanted to know if mindfulness really helps people with these problems.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this?**

Researchers looked for studies that tested mindfulness programs. They found 40 studies with people who had drug or alcohol problems. These studies did not include people who only used tobacco.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included 2,825 people. Some studies looked at people with different drug or alcohol problems. Other studies focused on people using one specific substance, like alcohol or opioids.

**Where were these studies done?**

Most studies happened in the United States (23 studies). Eleven studies happened in Iran. Other studies happened in Thailand, Brazil, China, Taiwan, and Spain.

**What did researchers compare?**

Some studies compared mindfulness programs to other treatments. These other treatments included:
- Standard care
- Talk therapy
- Education about drugs and alcohol
- Support groups
- Exercise
- Medicine

Other studies compared mindfulness programs to no treatment at all.

**When did researchers measure results?**

Researchers checked results at two times. First, right after the mindfulness program ended. Second, at follow-up visits 3 to 10 months later.

## Results

**What did the studies show?**

When researchers compared mindfulness to other treatments, they found:
- Mindfulness may slightly reduce the number of days people use drugs or alcohol
- This small benefit appeared both right after treatment and at follow-up
- About the same number of people stayed in mindfulness programs as stayed in other treatments
- For other measures, the results were unclear

The studies looked at other things too:
- Whether people stayed completely clean and sober
- How much drugs or alcohol people used
- How strong their cravings were

For these measures, researchers could not tell if mindfulness helped.

When researchers compared mindfulness to no treatment, the results were very unclear. They could not tell if mindfulness helped more than doing nothing.

**Was mindfulness safe?**

Only four studies reported on safety. The information available suggests mindfulness does not cause harm. But more studies need to report on safety.

**What does this mean?**

Mindfulness programs might help reduce drug or alcohol use a little bit. But the benefit appears small. More research is needed to know if mindfulness really helps. More research is also needed to know if it is safe.

**How current is this information?**

Researchers looked for studies published through April 2021.

**Who paid for these studies?**

Sixteen studies had no funding. The other studies got money from different sources. These included government agencies, universities, non-profit groups, and clinics."
10.1002-14651858.CD011749.pub2-abstract.txt,"Medicines to treat delirium in critically ill adult patients
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence from randomized controlled trials for the benefits and safety of all prescription medicines used to treat critically ill adult patients with delirium in the intensive care units (ICUs) of hospitals. 
Background 
Delirium is commonly associated with surgery, infection, or critical illness. It is experienced as new‐onset, generally short‐term inability to think clearly. Patients with delirium shift between periods of clear thinking and periods of agitation and/or great sleepiness and confusion. Lack of sleep, pain, a noisy environment, physical restraint, and the use of sedatives and strong analgesics are some of the contributing factors. Delirium affects both immediate and longer‐term health outcomes of critically ill patients as it can increase the length of time a breathing machine is required, time spent in the ICU and in hospital, and the chance of functional weakening and death. The odds of a poor outcome with delirium are increased with frail patients and those of advanced age and already present cognitive difficulties. Frequently, delirious ICU patients are given medicines to help treat symptoms such as agitation. 
Study characteristics 
This review is current to 21 March 2019. We found 14 randomized controlled studies that enrolled a total of 1844 adult participants. Six different classes of medicines were tested. These were antipsychotic drugs used as tranquillizers in ten studies; the sedative alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine in three studies; statins that reduce cholesterol in two studies; opioids as part of pain management in one study; serotonin antagonists for nausea and vomiting in one study; and cholinesterase inhibitors, which are medicines for Alzheimer's disease, in one study. Ten studies compared medicine to placebo ‐ an inactive medicine also known as a sugar pill; four studies compared different drugs. Eleven studies with 1153 participants reported on the main outcome of this review ‐ duration of delirium. 
Key findings 
When drug classes were directly compared with placebo, only the alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine was found to reduce the duration of delirium, and the cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine was found to prolong the duration of delirium. Each of these results is based on findings from a single small study. The other drugs when compared to placebo did not change delirium duration. The Review authors used the statistical method of network meta‐analysis to compare the six different drug classes. Dexmedetomidine was ranked most effective in reducing delirium duration, followed by atypical antipsychotics. However, network meta‐analysis of delirium duration failed to rule out the possibility of no difference for all six drug classes compared to placebo. Using this method, we did not find that any drug improved the duration of coma, length of stay, long‐term cognitive outcomes, or death. The alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine shortened time spent on a breathing machine. Adverse events often were not reported in these trials or were rare when reported. An analysis of reported events showed that events were similar to those reported with placebo. We found 10 ongoing studies and six studies awaiting classification that, once published and assessed, may change the conclusions of this review. 
Quality of the evidence 
Most of the included studies were small but of good design. Nine of the 14 studies were considered to have low risk of bias. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Medicines to Treat Confusion in Very Sick Hospital Patients

## Plain Title

Testing Different Medicines to Treat Sudden Confusion in Very Sick Adults in Hospital

## Rationale

**What is delirium?**

Delirium is a sudden change in how the brain works. It makes people confused and unable to think clearly. People with delirium go back and forth between being awake and alert, then very sleepy or upset. This can happen to very sick people in the hospital.

**What causes delirium?**

Delirium often happens after surgery or during serious illness. Many things can cause it. These include not sleeping well, being in pain, loud noise, being tied down, and taking strong pain medicines or sleep medicines.

**Why is delirium a problem?**

Delirium makes sick people get worse. It can make them need a breathing machine longer. They may stay in the hospital longer. They may become weaker. Some people may die. Delirium is worse for older people and people who are already weak or confused.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors often give medicines to calm upset patients with delirium. But we need to know if these medicines really help. We need to know if they are safe.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to find out which medicines work best to treat delirium. They wanted to know if medicines make delirium go away faster. They also wanted to know if the medicines cause harm.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review of other studies. Researchers looked at 14 studies done by other scientists. They combined the results to see what works.

**Who was in these studies?**

All studies included very sick adults in intensive care units (ICUs). ICUs are special hospital areas for the sickest patients. A total of 1,844 people were in all the studies combined.

**What medicines were tested?**

Six different types of medicines were tested:
- Antipsychotic drugs (10 studies) - medicines that calm agitation
- Dexmedetomidine (3 studies) - a sleep medicine
- Statins (2 studies) - medicines that lower cholesterol
- Opioids (1 study) - strong pain medicines
- Serotonin antagonists (1 study) - medicines for nausea
- Cholinesterase inhibitors (1 study) - medicines for memory problems

**How were medicines compared?**

Ten studies compared real medicine to a fake pill (placebo). Four studies compared different medicines to each other.

**When was this review done?**

Researchers looked at all studies published up to March 21, 2019.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

Most medicines did not make delirium go away faster than fake pills.

Only one medicine helped. Dexmedetomidine (a sleep medicine) made delirium shorter. But this result came from just one small study.

One medicine made things worse. Rivastigmine (a memory medicine) made delirium last longer. This also came from one small study.

**Did medicines help with other problems?**

Dexmedetomidine helped patients get off breathing machines faster. No other medicines helped with:
- Time spent in a coma
- Time spent in the hospital
- Memory problems later
- Death

**Were the medicines safe?**

Most studies did not report side effects well. When side effects were reported, they were rare. The medicines seemed as safe as fake pills.

**How good was this evidence?**

Most studies were small but well done. Nine out of 14 studies were high quality.

**What happens next?**

Ten more studies are still being done. Six more studies are waiting to be reviewed. These new studies might change what we know.

**What do these results mean?**

Right now, we do not have strong proof that most medicines help treat delirium in very sick patients. Only dexmedetomidine showed some benefit. More research is needed to find better treatments for delirium."

What is the aim of this review? 
We wanted to find out if stress management programmes at work had a different effect if they were given via a computer, compared to being given in person. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. We found two studies that studied the effect of the delivery method on stress reduction in workers. 
Key messages 
The effects of the delivery method on stress reduction were unclear. More research should be conducted to directly compare equivalent stress management programmes delivered via a computer and in‐person. Any future studies will likely affect the conclusions of this review. 
What was studied in the review?  Many employers wish to reduce stress in their employees and are willing to invest in stress management programmes. It has been shown that workplace stress management programmes can reduce stress in employees, either when delivered by a computer or mobile device, or by a live person. However, it is unclear if the delivery method itself impacts how effective the programme is. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of the intervention delivery method (computer or in person) to reduce stress in workers. 
What are the results of the review? 
We found two studies, involving 159 employees, that looked at stress levels in workers after completing stress management programmes on a computer, compared to workers receiving that same programme content from a live person. Both studies taught participants, individually or in small groups, how to recognise and reduce stress, but had conflicting results. 
How up to date is this review? 
We searched for studies that had been published up to February 2017.

## Plain Title
Comparing Stress Help Programs at Work: Computer-Based vs. Face-to-Face

## Rationale

**What is workplace stress and why does it matter?**

Many workers feel stressed at their jobs. Stress can make people feel worried, tired, or upset. It can affect their health and how well they do their work. This is a big problem for many employees.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Many bosses want to help their workers feel less stressed. They are willing to pay for programs that teach stress management. These programs help workers learn ways to handle stress better.

Stress help programs can be given in two main ways. One way is through a computer or phone. The other way is with a real person teaching face-to-face. Both types of programs have been shown to help reduce stress.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to know if one way of teaching works better than the other. Does learning from a computer work as well as learning from a real person? Or does one method help workers more than the other?

This question is important. If computer programs work just as well, they might cost less money. They might also be easier for more workers to use. But if face-to-face programs work better, that would be good to know too.

## Trial Design

**How was this study set up?**

This was a review study. The researchers looked for other studies that had already been done. They wanted to find studies that compared both methods of teaching stress management.

**Who was in the studies?**

The researchers found two studies to review. These two studies included 159 workers total. The studies did not say if workers were men or women. They did not give details about the workers' ages.

**What did the workers do?**

Workers in these studies learned about stress management. Some workers used a computer program. Other workers learned the same information from a real person. Some learned alone. Others learned in small groups.

The programs taught workers two main things:
- How to notice when they feel stressed
- How to reduce their stress

**How long did the studies last?**

The review did not say how long workers stayed in the studies.

**When was this review done?**

The researchers looked for studies published up to February 2017.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The two studies had different results. One study might have shown one method worked better. The other study might have shown something different. Because the results did not agree, the answer is unclear.

**What does this mean?**

Right now, we cannot say if computer programs work better, worse, or the same as face-to-face programs. There is not enough proof yet to know for sure.

**Why is this important?**

This review shows we need more research. We need more studies that compare these two methods directly. The studies should use the same stress program content. They should only change how the program is delivered.

**What comes next?**

More studies need to be done. When new studies are finished, they will likely change what we know. Future research will help answer this question better.

**Main conclusions:**

- Both computer and face-to-face stress programs can help workers
- We do not yet know which method works better
- Only two small studies compared these methods directly
- More research is needed to find the answer
- Future studies will help employers choose the best way to help their workers

This information can help bosses make better choices about stress programs at work. It can also help workers know what to expect from different types of stress help programs."

The problem 
There is increasing evidence that people who have undergone brain surgery experience significant pain. This pain can have serious consequences including raised blood pressure, agitation, prolonged recovery time and an increased risk of long‐term headaches. Research studies have looked at different drugs in an attempt to reduce the risk of pain for these people. There is now more evidence about pain reduction options for adults undergoing brain surgery but there remains uncertainty as to which options work best. 
The question 
This review aimed to determine which drugs provide the best chance of reducing pain for adults undergoing brain surgery, by collecting and combining the results of studies that looked at pain‐relieving drugs for this patient group. To provide an accurate answer to this question, only studies conducted in accordance with an approved high standard were included. Studies published in different languages and countries were included in order to obtain as much information as possible. 
In addition to determining which drugs were best at preventing or reducing pain after brain surgery, this review attempted to determine additional information such as how much additional pain‐relieving treatment was required in addition to the treatment under study; whether participants' pain was adequately controlled or not; how drowsy the participants were; what side effects they experienced; and how long they needed to stay in intensive care and in hospital. This review also considered whether some treatments worked better when given before or after surgery or for people undergoing different approaches to brain surgery. 
The results 
A total of 43 eligible studies, (42 complete and one still in progress), were found. Of the 42 completed studies (3548 participants), 10 studied injections of local anaesthetic into the scalp, 12 studied injection of local anaesthetic around specific scalp nerves, 8 studied nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 4 studied dexmedetomidine, 4 studied acetaminophen aka paracetamol), 2 studied opioid drugs, 3 studied gabapentin or pregabalin (anti‐seizure drugs that can also be used for pain relief) together with 1 study each of local anaesthetic injected into the veins, local anaesthetic injected into the jaw and the drug flupirtine. 
Sufficient information was abstracted to calculate the overall pain‐preventing effects of the following: local anaesthetic injections around the surgical wound, local anaesthetic injections around specific scalp nerves, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, dexmedetomidine and pregabalin or gabapentin. When only high‐quality studies were examined: NSAIDs reduced pain up to 24 hours after surgery, dexmedetomidine and local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves reduced pain in the first 12 hours after surgery, pregabalin or gabapentin reduced pain in the first 6 hours after surgery and local anaesthetic injections around the surgical wound significantly reduced pain 48 hours after surgery, but did not affect pain at earlier time points. 
When the timing of injection of local anaesthetics was examined, local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves provided better early pain relief (first 6 hours) when injected after surgery and better late pain relief (12 and 24 hours) when injected before surgery. 
The following interventions were also found to reduce the need for additional pain‐relieving drugs: local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves and dexmedetomidine. Gabapentin or pregabalin was found to reduce the risk of nausea and vomiting after surgery. 
Acetaminophen was not found to prevent pain after brain surgery or reduce the need for additional pain‐relieving drugs. 
Insufficient evidence was found to determine whether any of these drugs made the participants more or less drowsy, affected how long they needed to stay in intensive care or whether different drugs worked better for adults undergoing different approaches to brain surgery. 
The overall quality of the evidence that contributed to the results of this review was assessed and judged to be 'high' for pain‐reducing effects of NSAIDs, 'moderate' to 'low' for pain‐reducing effects of dexmedetomidine, acetaminophen, pregabalin and gabapentin and local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves and ' low' to ' very low' for pain‐reducing effects of local anaesthetic injections around the surgical wound, additional pain relief requirements and risk of nausea and vomiting after surgery .

## Plain Title
Testing Different Pain Medicines for Adults Having Brain Surgery

## Rationale

### What is the problem?
Many people feel a lot of pain after brain surgery. This pain is not just uncomfortable. It can cause other problems too. Pain can make blood pressure go up. It can make people feel upset and confused. It can make recovery take longer. It can also lead to headaches that last for months or years.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors have tried many different drugs to help reduce pain after brain surgery. Some studies have been done on these drugs. But doctors still do not know which drugs work best. This review brought together many studies to find the answer. The goal was to help doctors choose the best pain medicine for their patients.

### What did researchers want to learn?
Researchers wanted to know which drugs work best to prevent or reduce pain after brain surgery. They also wanted to know other important things. Did patients need extra pain medicine? Did the drugs make patients too sleepy? What side effects happened? How long did patients stay in the hospital? They also checked if some drugs worked better when given before surgery or after surgery.

## Trial Design

### How was this review designed?
This was not a single study. It was a review of many studies. Researchers looked for studies done the right way. They used strict rules to pick only good quality studies. They included studies from different countries. They included studies written in different languages. This helped them get as much information as possible.

### Who was in these studies?
All studies looked at adults having brain surgery. A total of 43 studies were found. Of these, 42 studies were finished. One study was still going on. The 42 finished studies included 3,548 people.

### What drugs were tested?
The studies tested many different types of drugs:
- 10 studies tested shots of numbing medicine into the scalp
- 12 studies tested shots of numbing medicine around scalp nerves
- 8 studies tested NSAIDs (drugs like ibuprofen)
- 4 studies tested a drug called dexmedetomidine
- 4 studies tested acetaminophen (also called paracetamol)
- 2 studies tested opioid drugs (strong pain medicines)
- 3 studies tested gabapentin or pregabalin (seizure drugs that also help with pain)
- Other studies tested different types of numbing medicines

## Results

### What did the review find?

#### Drugs that helped reduce pain:
**NSAIDs** worked well. They reduced pain up to 24 hours after surgery.

**Dexmedetomidine** helped reduce pain in the first 12 hours after surgery.

**Numbing medicine shots around scalp nerves** reduced pain in the first 12 hours. When given after surgery, they worked better in the first 6 hours. When given before surgery, they worked better at 12 and 24 hours.

**Pregabalin or gabapentin** reduced pain in the first 6 hours after surgery. These drugs also helped reduce feeling sick and throwing up.

**Numbing medicine shots around the surgical wound** reduced pain at 48 hours after surgery. But they did not help with pain right after surgery.

#### Drugs that did not help much:
**Acetaminophen** did not prevent pain after brain surgery. It also did not reduce the need for extra pain medicine.

#### Other benefits found:
Some drugs helped patients need less extra pain medicine. These were numbing medicine shots around scalp nerves and dexmedetomidine.

### What could not be determined?
The review could not tell if these drugs made patients more or less sleepy. It could not tell if they changed how long patients stayed in intensive care. It could not tell if different drugs worked better for different types of brain surgery.

### How good was the evidence?
The quality of evidence was different for different drugs. Evidence for NSAIDs was high quality. Evidence for some other drugs was moderate or low quality. This means doctors can be more sure about some findings than others.

### What does this mean?
This review helps doctors know which pain medicines work best after brain surgery. NSAIDs, dexmedetomidine, and numbing medicine shots around nerves seem to work well. More research is still needed to answer some questions."
10.1002-14651858.CD011960.pub2-abstract.txt,"Treatment with all‐trans retinoic acid in addition to chemotherapy for adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (non‐APL) 
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aims to determine benefits and harms of all‐trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in addition to chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone for adults with AML. We did not evaluate participants with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found eight studies. 
Key messages 
The addition of ATRA to chemotherapy did not show relevant differences in terms of overall survival (OS), but the subgroup analyses showed that there is potential benefit for ATRA in combination with a certain chemotherapeutic called decitabine , for older patients (over 60 years) and for patients who already had successful chemotherapy and now receive therapy for maintenance. We assessed the certainty of evidence as moderate for OS, disease‐free‐survival and on‐study mortality. 
Rates of toxicities were low, therefore certainty of evidence is 'very low' to 'low' for the adverse events diarrhoea, nausea/vomiting and cardiac toxicity. For the adverse event infection, we judged the certainty of evidence as moderate. Currently, it seems the risk of adverse events with additional ATRA are comparable to chemotherapy only. 
Quality of life was not reported by any of the included trials.
What was studied in this review? 
Acute myeloid leukaemia is a life‐threatening type of cancer that starts in the blood‐forming cells of the bone marrow and can cause many different signs and symptoms. It is classified into several subtypes, of which one subtype, acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) is treated differently to the other subtypes. 
Almost 60% of patients are older than 65 years at the time of diagnosis. Because of advanced age and accompanying diseases an intensive therapy with high‐dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation often is not possible or is accompanied by high risks for serious adverse events and treatment‐related mortality. For these reasons it would be important to know a less intensive and dangerous therapy for older patients. 
All‐trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an intermediate product of vitamin A, had been integrated into treatment regimens for APL by the end of the 1980s. It is administered orally and is generally well tolerated but can induce a severe, life‐threatening complication called differentiation syndrome, which includes breathing difficulties and fever. 
The literature provides contradictory data about the benefit of ATRA for patients with AML. It has been reported to increase the sensitivity of AML cell lines to chemotherapy by reducing one protein, which is associated with poor response to chemotherapy and therefore is related to a poor prognosis.These reports have led to the assumption that ATRA added to chemotherapy may improve outcomes and might replace or reduce the intensity of chemotherapy for patients with AML. 
What are the main results of this review? 
We found eight relevant studies with almost 4000 patients in total, conducted in the UK, Germany and France. These studies compared chemotherapy in combination with ATRA with chemotherapy alone in adult patients (over 18 years) with AML. All the included trials used different chemotherapy schedules, as there are several types of chemotherapy regimens for AML. Only in one trial did participants receive a newer drug, decitabine, which has been licensed for the treatment of AML since 2012. 
Adding ATRA to chemotherapy probably makes little or no difference to OS. ATRA may be potentially beneficial in combination with decitabine, for older patients (over 60 years) and for patients who receive therapy for maintenance, but these findings need to be explored by further research. 
For disease‐free‐survival, complete response rate and on‐study mortality there was probably no or little difference between treatment groups. 
The combination of ATRA probably did not lead to a higher infection rate. Regarding cardiac toxicity and diarrhoea, the certainty of the evidence was assessed as very low, so we are uncertain whether the addition of ATRA is beneficial. 
Quality of life was not reported by any of the included trials.
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We searched for studies that had been published up to July 2018.
","# Plain Language Summary: Adding Vitamin A Treatment to Chemotherapy for Adults with Blood Cancer

## Plain Title
Does adding a vitamin A drug to chemotherapy help adults with acute myeloid leukemia (a type of blood cancer)?

## Rationale

**What is acute myeloid leukemia?**
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a serious blood cancer. It starts in the bone marrow, where blood cells are made. This cancer can cause many health problems throughout the body.

**Who gets this disease?**
Most people with AML are older adults. About 6 out of 10 patients are over 65 years old when doctors find the cancer.

**Why is treating older patients difficult?**
Older patients often cannot receive strong chemotherapy treatments. They may have other health problems. Strong treatments can cause serious side effects. Some treatments can even be deadly for older patients.

**What is ATRA?**
ATRA stands for all-trans retinoic acid. It comes from vitamin A. Doctors already use ATRA to treat one type of blood cancer called acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Patients take ATRA by mouth. Most people handle it well.

**Why might ATRA help with AML?**
Some research shows ATRA may help chemotherapy work better. It may reduce a protein that makes cancer cells resist treatment. Scientists thought adding ATRA to chemotherapy might help patients live longer. It might also let doctors use less intense chemotherapy.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors needed to know if ATRA really helps patients with AML. Different studies showed different results. This review looked at all the research to find the answer.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**
This was a review study. Researchers looked at eight different studies. They combined the results to find patterns.

**Who was in these studies?**
- Almost 4,000 adult patients total
- All patients were over 18 years old
- All had AML (not the APL type)
- Studies took place in the UK, Germany, and France

**What did the studies compare?**
One group got chemotherapy plus ATRA. The other group got chemotherapy alone. Each study used different chemotherapy drugs. Only one study used a newer drug called decitabine.

**When were these studies done?**
The review included studies published up to July 2018.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

**Overall survival:**
Adding ATRA to chemotherapy probably made little or no difference. Most patients lived about the same amount of time with or without ATRA.

**Who might benefit from ATRA?**
Some groups might benefit, but more research is needed:
- Patients over 60 years old
- Patients taking decitabine
- Patients getting maintenance therapy (treatment after the cancer responds)

**Other health measures:**
- Disease-free survival: Probably no difference
- Complete response rate: Probably no difference
- Deaths during the study: Probably no difference

**Side effects:**
The review looked at harmful effects from treatment.

- Infections: Probably no increase with ATRA
- Heart problems: Unclear if ATRA makes a difference
- Diarrhea: Unclear if ATRA makes a difference
- Nausea and vomiting: Unclear if ATRA makes a difference

Overall, side effects were similar in both groups. ATRA did not seem to cause more problems than chemotherapy alone.

**Quality of life:**
None of the studies measured how patients felt during treatment. This is an important gap in the research.

**What do these results mean?**
For most patients with AML, adding ATRA to chemotherapy does not help them live longer. It does not seem to cause more side effects. Some older patients and patients on certain treatments might benefit. Doctors need more research to know for sure.

**What is still unknown?**
- Does ATRA help patients feel better during treatment?
- Which patients benefit most from ATRA?
- Does ATRA work better with newer cancer drugs?

Future studies should answer these questions."
10.1002-14651858.CD011979.pub2-abstract.txt,"Phototherapy for treating foot ulcers in people with diabetes
Review question 
Phototherapy is a pain‐free method of treatment that uses light to treat various medical conditions. We reviewed the evidence about phototherapy for foot ulcers in people with diabetes. We wanted to find out whether phototherapy speeds up wound healing and improves patients' quality of life, and whether there are any side effects. 
Background 
Foot ulcers are a disabling complication of diabetes that affect 15% to 25% of people with diabetes at some time in their lives. Diabetic foot ulcers are painful and prone to infection. Not all diabetic foot ulcers can be healed, which can ultimately lead to surgical removal of a limb. Phototherapy involves exposing the affected area to ultraviolet light, sometimes using lasers. This is thought to help ulcers heal through multiple mechanisms such as increased cell growth and blood vessel activity. It has been used as an alternative approach for healing foot ulcers in people with diabetes. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing different phototherapies, or comparing phototherapy with other treatments or a placebo (sham treatment), for foot ulcers in adults with diabetes in October 2016. We included eight trials (316 participants). Most studies were undertaken in clinics or hospitals and had small numbers of participants (14 to 84). The average age in the included studies was from 53 to 68 years, and the ratio of females to males was 0.46 to 1.88. The included studies compared phototherapy with placebo or no phototherapy, on top of usual care (usual care could include treatments such as dressings, antibiotics, or wound cleaning). Treatment times ranged from 15 days to 20 weeks. 
Key results 
The results suggested that phototherapy, when compared to no phototherapy or a placebo, may increase the proportion of wounds completely healed during follow‐up and reduce wound size. However, as the included studies involved small numbers of participants and had drawbacks in study methods, our confidence in these results is limited. We did not find sufficient evidence that the potential harms or incidence of amputations differed between the phototherapy group and the no phototherapy/placebo group. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the quality of the evidence to be low due to a lack of data and risk of the study results being biased. Further high‐quality studies are needed to confirm the benefits and harms of phototherapy.

","# Plain Language Summary: Phototherapy for Treating Foot Ulcers in People with Diabetes

## Plain Title
Using Light Therapy to Heal Foot Wounds in People with Diabetes

## Rationale

### What is the health problem?
People with diabetes can develop open sores on their feet called foot ulcers. These wounds are common. Between 15 and 25 out of every 100 people with diabetes will get a foot ulcer at some point in their lives.

Foot ulcers cause several problems for patients. They are painful. They can easily become infected. Some foot ulcers do not heal. When this happens, doctors may need to remove part of the leg. This is called amputation.

### What is phototherapy?
Phototherapy is a treatment that uses light. Doctors shine special light on the wound. Sometimes they use laser light. The light does not cause pain.

### Why might phototherapy help?
Scientists think light therapy helps wounds heal in several ways. The light may help cells grow faster. It may also help blood vessels work better. Better blood flow can help wounds heal.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors need better ways to heal foot ulcers in people with diabetes. Phototherapy might be a helpful treatment option. Researchers wanted to find out if phototherapy really works.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was a review study. Researchers looked at eight different studies done by other scientists. They combined the results to see what the evidence showed.

### Who was in these studies?
The studies included 316 people total. All of them had diabetes and foot ulcers. The people were between 53 and 68 years old on average. The studies included both men and women.

### What did the studies compare?
The studies compared two groups. One group received phototherapy plus usual care. The other group received only usual care or fake treatment (placebo). Usual care included normal wound treatments like bandages, antibiotics, or wound cleaning.

### How long did the studies last?
Treatment times were different in each study. Some lasted 15 days. Others lasted up to 20 weeks.

### Where did the studies take place?
Most studies happened in clinics or hospitals. Each study had between 14 and 84 people.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
The results suggested phototherapy might help in two ways. First, more wounds healed completely when people received phototherapy. Second, wounds became smaller with phototherapy treatment.

However, the researchers have concerns about these results. The studies were small. They also had some problems with how they were done. This means we cannot be completely sure the results are accurate.

### Were there any side effects?
The researchers did not find clear evidence about harmful effects. They also did not find clear differences in amputation rates between the two groups. This means they could not tell if phototherapy caused harm or prevented amputations.

### What do these results mean?
Phototherapy might help heal foot ulcers in people with diabetes. But we need more research to be sure. The current evidence is limited.

### What is the quality of this evidence?
The researchers rated the quality of evidence as low. This means the findings might change when better studies are done. The studies were small and had some weaknesses.

### What happens next?
More high-quality studies are needed. These studies should include more people. They should be designed more carefully. This will help us know for certain whether phototherapy works and whether it is safe.

### When was this information current?
This summary includes research up to October 26, 2016."
10.1002-14651858.CD012019-abstract.txt,"Urinary biomarkers for the non‐invasive diagnosis of endometriosis
Review Question 
How accurate are urine test in detecting endometriosis? Can any urine test be accurate enough to replace or reduce the need for surgery in the diagnosis of endometriosis? 
Background 
Women with endometriosis have endometrial tissue (the tissue that lines the womb and is shed during menstruation) growing outside the womb within the pelvic cavity. This tissue responds to reproductive hormones causing painful periods, chronic lower abdominal pain and difficulty conceiving. Currently, the only reliable way of diagnosing endometriosis is to perform laparoscopic surgery and visualise the endometrial deposits inside the abdomen. Because surgery is risky and expensive, urine tests have been evaluated for their ability to detect endometriosis non‐invasively. An accurate urine test could lead to the diagnosis of endometriosis without the need for surgery; or it could reduce the need for diagnostic surgery, so only women who were most likely to have endometriosis would require it. Other non‐invasive ways of diagnosing endometriosis using blood, imaging, endometrial and combination tests are evaluated in separate Cochrane reviews from this series. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence included in this review is current to July 2015. We included eight studies involving 646 participants. All studies evaluated reproductive‐aged women who were undertaking diagnostic surgery to investigate symptoms of endometriosis or for other indications. Five studies evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of four urinary biomarkers, including four biomarkers that were expressed differently in women with and without endometriosis and one showing no difference between the two groups. Three other studies just identified three biomarkers that did not distinguish the two groups. 
Key results 
None of the assessed biomarkers, including cytokeratin 19 (CK 19), enolase 1 (NNE), vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) and urinary peptide profiling have been evaluated by enough studies to provide a meaningful assessment of test accuracy. None of the tests were accurate enough to replace diagnostic surgery. Several studies identified biomarkers that might be of value in diagnosing endometriosis, but there are too few reports to be sure of their diagnostic benefit. There is not enough evidence to recommend any urinary biomarker for use in clinical practice for the diagnosis of endometriosis. 
Quality of the evidence 
Generally, the reports were of low methodological quality and urine tests were only assessed in small individual studies. 
Future research 
More high quality research trials are needed to accurately assess the diagnostic potential of urinary biomarkers identified in small numbers of studies as having value in detecting endometriosis. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing Urine to Find Endometriosis

## Plain Title
Can Urine Tests Help Doctors Find Endometriosis Without Surgery?

## Rationale

**What is endometriosis?**
Some women have a health problem called endometriosis. The tissue that lines the inside of the womb grows in the wrong places. It grows outside the womb in the belly area. Each month, this tissue responds to hormones in the body. This causes painful periods. It causes long-term pain in the lower belly. It can make it hard to get pregnant.

**How do doctors find endometriosis now?**
Right now, doctors must do surgery to know for sure if a woman has endometriosis. The surgery is called laparoscopy. The doctor looks inside the belly with a small camera. They look for the tissue growing in the wrong places. But surgery has risks. Surgery costs a lot of money. Surgery takes time to recover.

**Why did researchers do this study?**
Researchers wanted to find a better way to diagnose endometriosis. They wanted to test if urine tests could find endometriosis. A urine test is simple. A woman gives a urine sample. The lab tests the urine for special markers. These markers might show if endometriosis is present. A good urine test could help women avoid surgery. Or it could help doctors know which women really need surgery.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was a review study. Researchers looked at many other studies done before. They searched for all studies about urine tests for endometriosis. They found studies done up to July 2015.

**Who was in the studies?**
The review included eight studies. These studies had 646 women total. All the women were of child-bearing age. All the women were having surgery. Some had surgery because of endometriosis symptoms. Others had surgery for different reasons. Doctors tested their urine and then did surgery. This let them compare the urine test results to what they found during surgery.

**What did the studies test?**
The studies tested different markers in urine. Some markers tested were:
- Cytokeratin 19 (CK 19)
- Enolase 1 (NNE)
- Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP)
- Urinary peptide profiling

Researchers wanted to see if these markers were different in women with endometriosis.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**
The researchers found that none of the urine tests worked well enough. None of the tests were good enough to replace surgery. The tests were not accurate enough to tell doctors which women had endometriosis.

Some studies found markers that might be helpful. But there were not enough studies of each marker. The researchers could not be sure if these markers really work.

**What was the quality of the studies?**
Most studies were not high quality. The studies were small. They did not test enough women. This made it hard to trust the results.

**What does this mean for patients?**
Right now, there is no urine test that doctors should use to find endometriosis. Women who might have endometriosis still need surgery for diagnosis. The urine tests studied so far are not ready for use in clinics or hospitals.

**What happens next?**
More research is needed. Future studies need to be bigger. They need to be better designed. They need to test more women. This will help researchers know if urine tests can really help find endometriosis.

**Main conclusion:**
Urine tests for endometriosis are not ready yet. More research must be done before doctors can use these tests to help patients."
10.1002-14651858.CD012030.pub2-abstract.txt,"Psychological therapies to reduce tiredness in patients with incurable cancer
Background 
Patients with incurable cancer often experience tiredness (fatigue) during cancer treatment. Psychological therapies may help to reduce this symptom. Tiredness in cancer patients receiving cancer treatment may be treated with psychological therapies aimed at influencing or changing thoughts, emotions, behaviours, social interactions, or a combination of these (e.g. cognitive‐behavioural therapies, supportive‐expressive group therapies). This review looked at how effective psychological therapies are in reducing tiredness in patients with incurable cancer receiving cancer treatment. 
Study characteristics 
In November 2016, we searched for clinical trials looking at psychological therapies in patients with incurable cancer receiving cancer treatment. We found 14 small studies of very low quality reporting data on tiredness outcomes, 12 of which provided data for analyses. A limited number (three studies) reported results about side effects; these studies investigated a psychological therapy combined with medication. 
Key findings 
Review authors found no support for the effectiveness of psychological therapies in reducing tiredness when assessed directly following the intervention. Very low‐quality evidence suggests that psychological therapies may improve physical functioning directly after the intervention and may improve tiredness at first follow‐up. Evidence shows no support for the effectiveness of psychosocial therapies in improving other domains of functioning. Limited evaluation of potential harm suggests no differences in side effects between patients receiving psychological therapy and those given usual care. Limited good quality evidence allows no conclusions on the use of psychological therapies in people with incurable cancer. Larger, high‐quality trials are needed to find out whether psychological therapies help reduce tiredness for people with incurable cancer during cancer treatment. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of study evidence using four levels: very low, low, moderate, and high. Very low‐quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High‐quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. Included studies had design problems and included a very small number of participants. Therefore, the quality of the evidence in this review is very low, and results of this review should be interpreted with caution.

People with cancer that cannot be cured often feel very tired. This tiredness is called fatigue. It happens during cancer treatment and makes daily life harder for patients.

### What might help?
Talking therapies might help reduce this tiredness. These are treatments where people talk with trained helpers. The therapies work on thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Some examples include cognitive-behavioral therapy and group support therapy.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors wanted to know if talking therapies really work. They needed to find out if these therapies can help patients with advanced cancer feel less tired. This would help doctors know what treatments to offer their patients.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked for studies that tested talking therapies in cancer patients. They searched medical records up to November 2016. They wanted to find all studies that measured tiredness in patients.

### Who was in the studies?
The studies included patients with cancer that could not be cured. These patients were getting cancer treatment at the time. The studies included both men and women of different ages.

### What did researchers find?
Researchers found 14 small studies. Only 12 of these studies had data they could use. All the studies were small. This means they did not include many patients. The studies also had problems with how they were set up.

### What about side effects?
Only 3 studies looked at side effects. These studies tested talking therapy combined with medicine. Very few studies checked if the therapy caused any harm.

## Results

### What were the main results?
The researchers found mixed results:

**Right after treatment ended:**
- Talking therapies did not help reduce tiredness right away.
- Talking therapies might help patients do daily activities better.
- The therapies did not improve other areas of life.

**At follow-up visits:**
- Talking therapies might help reduce tiredness later on.
- This means the benefits might show up after some time passes.

**About safety:**
- The few studies that checked found no difference in side effects.
- Patients who got talking therapy had the same side effects as patients who got usual care.

### What does this mean?
The researchers could not say for sure if talking therapies work. The studies were too small. The studies also had too many problems. This makes it hard to trust the results.

### What did the researchers conclude?
More research is needed. Future studies need to be bigger. They need to be better designed. Only then can doctors know if talking therapies really help reduce tiredness in people with advanced cancer.

### Why should we be careful?
The quality of evidence was very low. This means we cannot be confident about the results. Very low quality means the true answer might be very different from what these studies found.

### What happens next?
Larger and better studies are needed. These studies should include more patients. They should be carefully designed. They should measure tiredness in clear ways. Only then will we know if talking therapies can help patients with advanced cancer feel less tired during treatment."
10.1002-14651858.CD012080.pub2-abstract.txt,"Accuracy of different non‐invasive methods for identifying Helicobacter pylori 
Why is it important to know whether someone has Helicobacter pylori? 
Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) is a type of bacteria which may be present in the stomach of some people. H pylori is believed to cause a number of cancers, including stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, and throat cancer. H pylori is also linked with other diseases including stomach ulcers, heart burn, and a bloated feeling. If H pylori is found in an individual, appropriate treatment can be started. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To compare the accuracy of three different types of test for H pylori. These are: urea breath tests, blood tests (the specific blood test is called serology), and stool tests (in faeces). 
What was studied in this review? 
There are two types of urea breath test which use two different forms of carbon known as 13C and 14C, as well as multiple versions of serology and stool tests. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found 101 studies which included 11,003 people who were tested for H pylori. Of these 11,003 participants, 5839 (53.1%) had H pylori infection. All the studies used one of the three tests listed above and compared these test results with the diagnosis given by endoscopic biopsy. Endoscopic biopsy involves obtaining tissue from the stomach using a thin flexible tube introduced through the mouth and testing for the presence of H pylori under the microscope. It is currently the most accurate available test, however it causes physical discomfort to the patient, with associated risks for harm. This is in contrast to the alternative non‐invasive tests in this review which are significantly less uncomfortable and have minimal or no risk of harm, making them desirable alternatives if they can be shown to be as accurate at diagnosing H pylori as endoscopic biopsy. Most of the studies included participants with heart burn or similar problems in the stomach and excluded participants who had previously undergone partial removal of the stomach and those having treatment for H pylori. 
Thirty‐four studies (4242 participants) used serology; 29 studies (2988 participants) used stool antigen test; 34 studies (3139 participants) used urea breath test‐13C; 21 studies (1810 participants) used urea breath test‐14C; and two studies (127 participants) used urea breath test but did not report the type of carbon used. Studies varied in the limit they used before saying a test was positive for H pylori infection and the type of stains used to examine the biopsy material. When we looked at all the data we found that urea breath tests were more accurate than blood and stool tests. The results mean that, on average, if 1000 people are tested, there will be 46 people without H pylori who will be misdiagnosed as having H pylori. Also, there will be 30, 42, 86, and 89 people with H pylori infection for whom the diagnosis of H pylori infection will be missed by urea breath test‐13C, urea breath test‐14C, serology, and stool antigen test, respectively. When we looked at the seven studies which compared urea breath test‐13C and serology, or urea breath test‐13C and stool antigen tests in the same participants, the results were uncertain and we cannot tell which test is more accurate. 
How reliable are the results of the studies? 
Except for one study, all the studies were of poor methodological quality, which makes their results unreliable. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
These results apply to children and adults with suspected H pylori infection, but only in those who have not previously undergone stomach operations and those who have not recently had antibiotics or treatment for H pylori infection. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Urea breath tests, blood tests, and stool tests may be suitable for identifying whether someone has H pylori infection. However, the level of the result of urea breath test, blood test, or stool test which should be used to make a diagnosis of H pylori infection remains unclear. 
How up‐to‐date is the review? 
We performed a thorough literature search for studies reporting the accuracy of these different tests until 4 March 2016.

## Plain Title
Comparing Three Simple Tests to Find H. pylori Bacteria in the Stomach

## Rationale

### What is H. pylori and why does it matter?

H. pylori is a type of germ that can live in your stomach. Many people have this germ without knowing it. H. pylori can cause serious health problems. It may lead to stomach cancer and other cancers. It can also cause stomach ulcers, heartburn, and bloating. Finding and treating H. pylori early can help prevent these problems.

### Why was this study needed?

Doctors can find H. pylori by doing an endoscopy. This means putting a thin tube down your throat into your stomach. The doctor takes a small piece of tissue to look at under a microscope. This test works very well. But it is uncomfortable for patients. It can also cause harm in some cases.

Doctors wanted to know if simpler tests work just as well. These simpler tests do not cause discomfort. They have little or no risk of harm. The three simple tests are: a breath test, a blood test, and a stool test (testing your poop). If these tests work well, patients would not need the uncomfortable tube test.

### What did researchers want to find out?

Researchers wanted to compare how well these three simple tests find H. pylori. They wanted to know which test is most accurate.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?

This was a review study. Researchers looked at 101 different studies. These studies included 11,003 people in total. About half of these people (5,839 people) had H. pylori infection.

### Who was in these studies?

The studies included both children and adults. Most people in the studies had heartburn or stomach problems. The studies did not include people who had stomach surgery before. They also did not include people who recently took antibiotics or H. pylori treatment.

### What tests did researchers compare?

Researchers looked at three types of simple tests:
- **Breath tests**: You breathe into a special container after drinking a liquid. There are two types using different forms of carbon (called 13C and 14C).
- **Blood tests**: Doctors take a small amount of blood to test.
- **Stool tests**: Doctors test a sample of your poop.

All these tests were compared to the endoscopy test (the tube test). This helped researchers see which simple tests were most accurate.

## Results

### What did the study find?

The breath tests worked better than blood tests and stool tests. But none of the tests were perfect.

### What do these results mean?

If 1,000 people get tested:
- About 46 people without H. pylori will be told they have it (when they do not)
- Some people with H. pylori will be told they do not have it (when they do):
  - 30 people will be missed by the 13C breath test
  - 42 people will be missed by the 14C breath test
  - 86 people will be missed by the blood test
  - 89 people will be missed by the stool test

### How reliable are these results?

Most studies had quality problems. This makes the results less reliable. Seven studies compared tests in the same people. These studies could not clearly show which test was best.

### What does this mean for patients?

All three types of simple tests may help find H. pylori. Breath tests seem to work best. But doctors still need to learn more. They need to know what test result level means someone has H. pylori.

### Who can use these results?

These results apply to children and adults who might have H. pylori. But they only apply if you have not had stomach surgery. They also only apply if you have not recently taken antibiotics or H. pylori treatment.

### Final thoughts

Simple tests can help find H. pylori without the uncomfortable tube test. More research is needed to make these tests work even better. Doctors need clearer guidelines about what test results mean.

10.1002-14651858.CD012129.pub3-abstract.txt,"Aspirin (single dose) for relief of perineal pain after childbirth
What is the issue? 
Can aspirin be given to women who experience perineal pain following childbirth to relieve the pain, without causing side effects for either the women or their babies? 
Why is this important? 
Many women experience pain in the perineum (the area between the vagina and anus) following childbirth. The perineum may be bruised or torn during childbirth, or have a cut made to help the baby to be born (an episiotomy). After childbirth, perineal pain can interfere with women's ability to care for their newborns and establish breastfeeding. If perineal pain is not relieved effectively, longer‐term problems for women may include painful sexual intercourse, pelvic floor problems resulting in incontinence, prolapse, or chronic perineal pain. Aspirin may be given to women who have perineal pain after childbirth, but its effectiveness and safety had not been assessed in a systematic review. This is an update of a review last published in 2017. This is part of a series of reviews looking at drugs to help relieve perineal pain in first few weeks after childbirth. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence in October 2019, and included 17 randomised controlled studies, involving 1132 women, published between 1967 and 1997. All women had perineal pain following an episiotomy (usually within 48 hours after birth), and were not breastfeeding. The women received either aspirin (doses ranging from 300 mg to 1200 mg) or fake pills (placebo), by mouth. The methodological quality of the studies was often unclear. Two studies did not contribute any data for analyses. 
Aspirin compared with placebo may increase adequate pain relief for mothers four to eight hours after administration (low‐certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether aspirin compared with placebo has an effect on the need for additional pain relief, or on adverse effects for mothers, in the four to eight hours after administration (both very low‐certainty evidence). 
The effects of administering 300 mg versus 600 mg aspirin (1 study), 600 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin (2 studies), or 300 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin (1 study) are uncertain for adequate pain relief, the need for additional pain relief, or adverse effects for the mother. 
No studies reported on adverse effects of aspirin for the baby, or other outcomes we planned to assess: prolonged hospital stay, or readmission to hospital due to perineal pain; perineal pain six weeks after childbirth, women's views, or postpartum depression. 
What does this mean? 
A single dose of aspirin may help with perineal pain following episiotomy for women who are not breastfeeding, when measured four to eight hours after administration. 
We found no information to assess the effects of aspirin for women who are breastfeeding.
","# Plain Language Summary: Aspirin for Pain Relief After Childbirth

## Plain Title
Does aspirin help reduce pain in the area between the vagina and anus after giving birth?

## Rationale

### What is the problem?
Many women feel pain in the perineum after having a baby. The perineum is the area between the vagina and anus. This pain happens because the area can get bruised or torn during birth. Sometimes doctors make a cut in this area to help the baby come out. This cut is called an episiotomy.

### Why does this matter?
Pain in this area can make it hard for new mothers to care for their babies. It can also make it hard to start breastfeeding. If the pain does not go away, women may have problems later on. These problems can include pain during sex, trouble holding in urine or stool, or long-term pain.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors sometimes give aspirin to help with this pain. But no one had carefully looked at all the research to see if aspirin really works. Researchers also wanted to know if aspirin is safe for mothers and babies. This study is part of a larger group of studies looking at different pain medicines for new mothers.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked for all studies about aspirin and perineal pain. They found 17 studies that were done between 1967 and 1997. These studies included 1,132 women total.

### Who was in the studies?
All the women had perineal pain after an episiotomy. Most women were studied within 48 hours after giving birth. None of the women were breastfeeding.

### What did the women receive?
Some women got aspirin pills. The amount of aspirin ranged from 300 mg to 1,200 mg. Other women got fake pills that looked like aspirin but had no medicine in them. These are called placebo pills. Researchers then watched to see which group felt better.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
Aspirin may help reduce perineal pain better than fake pills. Researchers measured pain relief 4 to 8 hours after women took the medicine. However, the quality of this evidence was low.

Researchers were not sure if aspirin affected how many women needed extra pain medicine. They also were not sure if aspirin caused side effects in mothers. The evidence for these findings was very low quality.

Some studies compared different amounts of aspirin. For example, 300 mg versus 600 mg, or 600 mg versus 1,200 mg. Researchers could not tell which dose worked best.

### What was missing?
The studies did not look at whether aspirin caused problems for babies. They also did not look at other important things like:
- How long women stayed in the hospital
- Whether women had to go back to the hospital because of pain
- Whether women still had pain 6 weeks after birth
- What women thought about the treatment
- Whether women felt depressed after birth

### What does this mean?
A single dose of aspirin may help with perineal pain after an episiotomy. This seems to work when measured 4 to 8 hours after taking the medicine. But this finding is only for women who are not breastfeeding.

The studies did not include women who were breastfeeding. So researchers do not know if aspirin is safe or helpful for breastfeeding mothers.

### Important notes
All the studies in this review are old. They were done between 1967 and 1997. The quality of the studies was often unclear. More research is needed to know for sure if aspirin is a good choice for perineal pain after childbirth."
10.1002-14651858.CD012204.pub2-abstract.txt,"Dipeptidyl‐peptidase (DPP)‐4 inhibitors and glucagon‐like peptide (GLP)‐1 analogues for prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
Review question 
Are the glucose‐lowering medicines, DPP‐4 inhibitors (e.g. linagliptin or vildagliptin) and GLP‐1 analogues (e.g. exenatide or liraglutide) able to prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes and its associated complications in people at risk for the development of type 2 diabetes? 
Background 
DPP‐4 inhibitors and GLP‐1 analogues are widely used to treat people with type 2 diabetes. People with moderately elevated blood glucose are said to be at an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes (often referred to as 'prediabetes'). It is currently not known whether DPP‐4 inhibitors or GLP‐1 analogues should be prescribed for people with raised blood glucose levels who do not have type 2 diabetes. We wanted to find out whether these medicines could prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people at increased risk. We also wanted to know the effects on patient‐important outcomes such as complications of diabetes (e.g. kidney and eye disease, heart attacks, strokes), death from any cause, health‐related quality of life (a measure of a person's satisfaction with their life and health) and side effects of the medicines. 
Study characteristics 
Participants had to have blood glucose levels higher than considered normal, but below the glucose levels that are used to diagnose type 2 diabetes mellitus. We found seven randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 2702 participants. The duration of the treatments varied from 12 weeks to 160 weeks. One study investigating liraglutide dominated the evidence (2285/2702 participants). The participants in this study were overweight or obese. 
This evidence is up to date as of January 2017.
Key results 
DPP‐4 inhibitors did not reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with placebo (a dummy medicine). In the big study investigating the GLP‐1‐analogue liraglutide, given in a dose used for obese people (3.0 mg), the development of type 2 diabetes was delayed: 26/1472 (1.8%) participants randomised to liraglutide compared with 46/738 (6.2%) participants randomised to placebo developed type 2 diabetes after 160 weeks. On the other side, 970/1472 (66%) participants randomised to liraglutide compared with 268/738 (36%) participants randomised to placebo switched back to normal glucose levels. This study was extended for another 12 weeks without treatment and five additional participants developed diabetes in the liraglutide group, compared with one participant in the placebo group. After the 12 weeks without treatment, 740/1472 (50%) participants in the liraglutide group compared with 263/738 (36%) participants in the placebo group had glucose levels considered as normal. This means that to keep chances high to prevent type 2 diabetes in people at risk one probably needs to continuously take this drug. Of note, serious adverse events (e.g. defined as hospitalisation or a hazard putting the participant at risk, such as an interaction with another medicine) happened more often following liraglutide treatment (230/1524 (15%) participants in the liraglutide group and 96/755 (13%) participants in the placebo group) and it is unclear whether taking this drug is safe in the long term. 
We detected neither an advantage nor a disadvantage of DPP‐4 inhibitors or GLP‐1 analogues in relation to non‐fatal heart attacks, non‐fatal strokes or heart failure. Our included studies did not report on other complications of diabetes such as kidney or eye disease. The effects on health‐related quality of life were inconclusive. In the included studies, very few participants died and there was no apparent relation to treatment. 
Future studies should investigate more patient‐important outcomes like complications of diabetes and especially the side effects of the medications, because we do not know for sure whether 'prediabetes' is just a condition arbitrarily defined by a laboratory measurement, is in fact a real risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus and whether treatment of this condition translates into better patient‐important outcomes. 
Quality of the evidence 
All included trials had deficiencies in the way they were conducted or how key items were reported. For the individual comparisons, the number of participants was small, resulting in a high risk of random errors (play of chance).

## Plain Title
Can Two Types of Diabetes Drugs Help Prevent Type 2 Diabetes in People at Risk?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some people have blood sugar levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be called type 2 diabetes. Doctors often call this ""prediabetes."" These people have a higher chance of getting type 2 diabetes in the future.

Type 2 diabetes is a serious health problem. It can damage the kidneys and eyes. It can also cause heart attacks and strokes. These problems make life harder for patients.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Two types of drugs are used to treat people who already have type 2 diabetes. These drugs are called DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 analogues. DPP-4 inhibitors include drugs like linagliptin and vildagliptin. GLP-1 analogues include drugs like exenatide and liraglutide.

Researchers wanted to know if these drugs could prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people at risk. They also wanted to know if these drugs could prevent diabetes problems like kidney disease, eye disease, heart attacks, and strokes. They looked at side effects and how the drugs affected quality of life.

**Why might these drugs work?**

These drugs lower blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. Researchers thought they might also help people with higher-than-normal blood sugar avoid getting diabetes.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at seven studies. These studies included 2,702 people total. The studies lasted from 12 weeks to 160 weeks (about 3 years).

**Who was in the studies?**

All people in the studies had blood sugar levels higher than normal. But their levels were not high enough to be called type 2 diabetes. One large study looked at 2,285 people. These people were overweight or obese. This study tested a drug called liraglutide.

**What did researchers do?**

Researchers put people into groups by chance. Some people got the real drug. Other people got a dummy pill called a placebo. Researchers then watched to see who got type 2 diabetes.

## Results

**What did the study find about DPP-4 inhibitors?**

DPP-4 inhibitors did not prevent type 2 diabetes. They worked no better than the dummy pill.

**What did the study find about GLP-1 analogues?**

One large study tested liraglutide at a high dose (3.0 mg). This is the dose used for weight loss in obese people. After 160 weeks:
- 26 out of 1,472 people taking liraglutide got diabetes (about 2 out of 100 people)
- 46 out of 738 people taking the dummy pill got diabetes (about 6 out of 100 people)

This means liraglutide delayed diabetes in some people.

Also after 160 weeks:
- 970 out of 1,472 people taking liraglutide had normal blood sugar (about 66 out of 100 people)
- 268 out of 738 people taking the dummy pill had normal blood sugar (about 36 out of 100 people)

**What happened when people stopped taking the drug?**

After people stopped taking liraglutide for 12 weeks, more people in the liraglutide group got diabetes. Blood sugar levels also went back up in many people. This suggests people may need to keep taking the drug to prevent diabetes.

**What about side effects?**

Serious side effects happened more often with liraglutide:
- 230 out of 1,524 people taking liraglutide had serious problems (about 15 out of 100 people)
- 96 out of 755 people taking the dummy pill had serious problems (about 13 out of 100 people)

Serious side effects include problems that put people in the hospital or cause other dangers.

**What about other health problems?**

The studies did not show clear benefits or harms for heart attacks, strokes, or heart failure. The studies did not look at kidney disease or eye disease. Very few people died in the studies. The drugs did not clearly affect quality of life.

**What do the results mean?**

Liraglutide may delay type 2 diabetes in overweight people at risk. But people may need to take it continuously. The drug has side effects. We do not know if it is safe long-term.

More research is needed. Future studies should look at diabetes complications and side effects. Researchers also need to find out if treating ""prediabetes"" truly helps patients in the long run.

**Quality note:** The studies had some problems in how they were done. Some studies were small. This means the results might not be completely reliable."
10.1002-14651858.CD012216.pub2-abstract.txt,"18F‐florbetapir PET scan for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia and other dementias in people with mild cognitive impairment 
Review question: In people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), does using a 18F PET scan with florbetapir predict the progression to Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) and other dementias? 
Background 
Due to global ageing, the number of people with dementia is expected to increase dramatically in the next few decades. Diagnosing dementia at an early stage is desirable, but there is no widespread agreement on the best approach. A range of simple pen and paper tests used by healthcare professionals can assess people with poor memory or cognitive impairment. Whether or not using special PET scans that detect amyloid —one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease— improves our ability to predict the progression from MCI to ADD or other forms of dementia remains unclear. Since these tests are expensive, it is important that they provide additional benefits. 
Aim 
We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the 18F‐florbetapir PET scan in identifying those people with MCI who clinically progress to ADD, other types of dementia, or any form of dementia over a period of time. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to May 2017. We found three studies including 453 participants with MCI. Two studies evaluated the progression from MCI to ADD and one study evaluated the progression from MCI to any form of dementia. 
Regarding the two studies that evaluated the progression from MCI to ADD, one study had 401 participants with a follow‐up of 1.6 years and the mean age was 72 years. The other study had 47 participants with a follow‐up of three years, and the mean age was 72 years. 
The other study that looked at any form of dementia included 5 participants over 90 years old. 
Two of the studies were funded by the test manufacturer.
Quality of the evidence 
The main limitation of this review was that our findings were based on only three studies, with insufficient detail on how the people were selected, whether the information from the scan was assessed separately from the final diagnosis. The studies were considered to be at high risk of bias due to potential conflicts of interest detected. 
Key findings 
In this review, we found the following results based on the three studies.
At a follow‐up of 1.6 years, using visual assessment, the scan correctly classified 89% of the participants who progressed to ADD but only 58% of the participants who did not progress to ADD. This means that in a group of 100 people with MCI, 15% of whom will develop ADD, we would expect 13 of 15 people to have a positive result and the other 2 participants to be falsely negative. Also 49 people who will not develop ADD would have a negative result, but 36 people who will not develop ADD would have a positive result (false positives). 
In the study that followed up people for three years and used visual assessment, the scan correctly classified 67% of people who progressed to ADD and 71% who did not progress to ADD. This means that in a group of 100 people with MCI, 19 of whom will develop ADD, we would expect 13 people to have a positive result of the scan and 6 people to have a falsely negative result. In addition, 58 of 81 participants who will not progress to ADD would have a negative result, but 23 people who will not develop ADD would have a positive result (false positives). The small number of participants evaluated at three years lowered our confidence on these estimates of accuracy. 
Regarding progression to any form of dementia, the extremely small number of participants meant that we were unable to provide meaningful estimates of accuracy. 
We conclude that 18F‐florbetapir PET scans cannot be recommended for routine use in clinical practice to predict the progression from MCI to ADD or any form of dementia based on the currently available data. More studies are needed to demonstrate its usefulness.

## Plain Title
Can a Special Brain Scan Help Predict if People with Memory Problems Will Develop Dementia?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Many older adults have mild memory problems called mild cognitive impairment, or MCI. People with MCI have more memory trouble than normal for their age, but they can still do daily activities. Some people with MCI will develop dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. Dementia causes serious memory loss and thinking problems that make daily life very hard.

**Why is this important?**

As people around the world live longer, more people will get dementia. Doctors want to find dementia early so they can help patients and families plan ahead. Right now, doctors use simple paper and pencil tests to check memory. But these tests may not show who will get worse.

**What is being tested?**

Scientists looked at a special brain scan called a PET scan. This scan uses a substance called florbetapir. The scan can find a protein called amyloid in the brain. Amyloid builds up in people with Alzheimer's disease. Researchers wanted to know if this scan could predict which people with MCI would develop dementia. These scans cost a lot of money, so doctors need to know if they really help.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to see if the florbetapir PET scan could correctly identify people with MCI who would develop Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia over time.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at other studies that had already been done. They searched for studies up to May 2017.

**Who was in the studies?**

The researchers found three studies with 453 people total. All people in the studies had MCI. Two studies looked at who developed Alzheimer's disease. One study looked at who developed any type of dementia.

In the first study, 401 people took part. Their average age was 72 years. Researchers followed them for about 1.6 years.

In the second study, 47 people took part. Their average age was also 72 years. Researchers followed them for three years.

The third study had only 5 people. All were over 90 years old.

**Important note:** Two of the three studies got money from the company that makes the scan.

## Results

**What did the studies find?**

The researchers found that the scan was not very good at predicting who would get dementia.

**Results after 1.6 years:**

In a group of 100 people with MCI, about 15 will develop Alzheimer's disease. The scan would correctly identify 13 of these 15 people. But it would miss 2 people who will get Alzheimer's disease. The scan would also give wrong results to 36 people. These people would get a positive scan result but would not develop Alzheimer's disease. Only 49 people who will not get Alzheimer's disease would get a correct negative result.

**Results after three years:**

In a group of 100 people with MCI, about 19 will develop Alzheimer's disease. The scan would correctly identify only 13 of these 19 people. It would miss 6 people who will get Alzheimer's disease. The scan would give wrong results to 23 people. These people would get a positive result but would not develop Alzheimer's disease. About 58 people who will not get Alzheimer's disease would get a correct negative result. However, very few people were in this study, so these numbers may not be reliable.

**Results for any type of dementia:**

The study looking at all types of dementia had too few people. The researchers could not draw any conclusions from it.

**What are the problems with these studies?**

The studies had several problems. The researchers did not have enough information about how people were chosen for the studies. They did not know if the scan results were read separately from the final diagnosis. Two studies got money from the scan maker, which could affect the results.

**What do the results mean?**

Based on these studies, doctors should not use this brain scan routinely to predict dementia in people with MCI. The scan makes too many mistakes. More research is needed to know if this scan is truly helpful."
10.1002-14651858.CD012470.pub2-abstract.txt,"Interventions for treating wrist fractures (broken wrists) in children
Background and aim 
Wrist fractures are the most common bone injury in children. Most are buckle (or torus) fractures, where the bone surface bulges out. These minor fractures heal well. They are often treated with a wrist splint or a below‐elbow plaster cast.  More serious fractures are where the bone breaks, generally resulting in displacement of the bone parts. Usually the bone is manipulated back into place ('reduction'), followed by cast immobilisation, often with an above‐elbow cast including the elbow. When considered, surgery generally involves placing wires through the skin and into the bone (percutaneous wiring). 
We aimed to assess the best‐quality evidence for different treatments of wrist fractures in children. 
Results of the search 
We searched medical databases up to May 2018 and included 30 studies with 2930 children. Studies included more male children and reported mean ages between eight and 10 years. We summarise the results from five key comparisons. 
Key results 
Six studies compared a removable splint with a below‐elbow cast for buckle fractures. One study found there may be little or no difference between the two devices in physical function at four weeks. Few children needed a change or reapplication of either splint or cast (4 studies). There were no refractures. We are uncertain whether there is any difference in pain during device use. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate time to return to former activities (recovery time), minor complications, and child or parent satisfaction. Two studies found lower healthcare costs for splints. 
Four studies compared a soft or elasticated bandage with a below‐elbow cast for buckle fractures. We are uncertain if there is less disability at four weeks after bandaging. Few children changed device or needed extended immobilisation (3 studies). There were no serious adverse events. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate recovery time, wrist pain, minor complications, and satisfaction. Children found the bandage more convenient (1 study). 
Two studies (mainly buckle fractures) compared cast removal at home by parents versus at the hospital fracture clinic by clinicians (a cast saw was not required for home removal). All had recovered function at four weeks (1 study). There were few treatment changes and no serious adverse effects. Recovery time and number of children with minor complications were not reported. There may be no difference in pain at four weeks (1 study). There may be greater parental satisfaction for cast removal at home (1 study). One study found lower healthcare costs for home removal. 
Four studies compared below‐elbow versus above‐elbow casts in usually displaced fractures. We are uncertain if children are less dependent on help when using below‐elbow casts. We are uncertain if there is a difference between the two casts in physical function at six months (1 study). We are uncertain about the finding that all children with above‐elbow casts needed another fracture reduction. There were no serious adverse events. Recovery time and minor complications were not reported. There may be little difference in needing physiotherapy for stiffness. Pain at one week may be less for below‐elbow casts (1 study). One study found lower healthcare costs for below‐elbow casts. 
Five studies compared percutaneous wiring and above‐elbow cast immobilisation versus above‐elbow cast immobilisation alone after closed reduction of displaced fractures. Short‐term physical function was not reported. There may be no between‐group difference in function at six months (1 study). We are uncertain whether surgery reduces the risk of treatment failure, defined as early or difficult removal of wires, and remanipulation for loss in position. We are uncertain whether there are fewer serious adverse events with surgery. Recovery time, wrist pain, and satisfaction were not reported. There may be less need for physiotherapy after surgery. One USA study found treatment costs were similar. 
Quality of the evidence 
All 30 studies had weaknesses that could affect the reliability of their results. We considered the evidence for all outcomes to be low or very low quality. 
Conclusion 
There is not enough evidence to determine the best ways of treating different types of wrist fractures in children. However, the review findings are consistent with the move away from cast immobilisation for buckle fractures. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Treating Broken Wrists in Children

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Ways to Treat Broken Wrists in Children

## Rationale

**What is a broken wrist?**
A broken wrist is the most common broken bone in children. There are two main types. The first type is called a buckle fracture. This happens when the bone bends and bulges out but does not break all the way through. These heal well on their own. The second type is more serious. The bone breaks all the way through. The broken pieces may move out of place.

**How are broken wrists treated?**
Doctors treat buckle fractures with a splint or cast on the lower arm. For more serious breaks, doctors may need to move the bone pieces back into place. Then they put on a cast. This cast may go up past the elbow. Sometimes doctors do surgery. They put thin wires through the skin into the bone to hold it in place.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors wanted to know which treatment works best for children with broken wrists. They wanted to find treatments that help children heal well and get back to normal activities quickly.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at 30 studies. These studies included 2,930 children total. Most children in the studies were boys. The children were between 8 and 10 years old on average.

The researchers compared five different treatment approaches:
- Removable splints versus casts for buckle fractures
- Soft bandages versus casts for buckle fractures
- Taking casts off at home versus at the hospital
- Short casts (below elbow) versus long casts (above elbow) for serious breaks
- Surgery with wires versus casts alone for serious breaks

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

**For buckle fractures treated with splints versus casts:**
Six studies looked at this question. After four weeks, children could use their wrists about the same with either treatment. Very few children needed their splint or cast changed. No bones broke again. Researchers could not tell if one treatment caused less pain. Two studies found that splints cost less money than casts.

**For buckle fractures treated with bandages versus casts:**
Four studies looked at this question. Researchers could not tell if bandages worked better than casts. Very few children needed to change their treatment. No serious problems happened. One study found children liked bandages better because they were easier to use.

**For taking casts off at home versus at the hospital:**
Two studies looked at this question. Most children had buckle fractures. All children healed well by four weeks. Very few needed treatment changes. No serious problems happened. Parents may have been happier when they could remove casts at home. One study found home removal cost less money.

**For short casts versus long casts for serious breaks:**
Four studies looked at this question. Researchers could not tell which cast worked better. No serious problems happened. Pain after one week may have been less with short casts. One study found short casts cost less money.

**For surgery with wires versus casts alone for serious breaks:**
Five studies looked at this question. After six months, wrists may have worked about the same with either treatment. Researchers could not tell if surgery prevented problems better than casts alone. Children who had surgery may have needed less physical therapy afterward.

**What do these results mean?**
All 30 studies had some problems that made the results less reliable. The researchers said the evidence quality was low or very low. There is not enough good evidence to say which treatment is best for different types of broken wrists in children. However, the findings support using simpler treatments like splints or bandages instead of casts for buckle fractures."
10.1002-14651858.CD012488.pub2-abstract.txt,"Psychological therapies for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions 
Why is this review important? 
More than one in ten children and adolescents have long‐term physical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and cancer. They are more likely to develop psychological problems like anxiety or depression. Treating these problems early can prevent difficulties with family life, school, and future mental health problems. It is currently unclear whether psychological therapies (talking therapies) designed for children and adolescents without medical issues are appropriate for use with this population. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
This review will be of interest to mental and medical healthcare providers, service users, and service commissioners. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
This review aims to answer the following questions: 1) Are psychological therapies better than a range of other therapies in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions? and 2) Are psychological therapies acceptable to this audience? 
Which studies were included in the review? 
We searched a number of databases to find all high‐quality trials of psychological therapies for anxiety or depression in children and adolescents aged 18 years or less with long‐term physical conditions and symptoms of anxiety or depression, published from 1970 to September 2018. We included twenty‐nine studies with a total of 1349 people in the review and rated the overall quality of the studies as 'low to moderate'. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
A handful of psychological therapies have been researched in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions. Most of these were developed for use with children and adolescents who do not have long‐term physical conditions. Some of these, particularly those based on principles of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and therapies specifically designed to treat depression or anxiety, are effective at reducing mild symptoms of these conditions in the short term. There is limited evidence that such therapies are acceptable to young people and that they can improve quality of life and symptoms of long‐term physical conditions. There is currently a lack of therapies for addressing health‐related anxiety in this population. 
What should happen next? 
Further research should be undertaken to develop more effective psychological therapies to treat anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Do Talking Therapies Help Children with Long-Term Health Problems Who Feel Anxious or Sad?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

More than 1 in 10 children have long-term health problems. These include asthma, diabetes, and cancer. These health problems do not go away quickly. Children with these conditions often feel worried or sad. They may develop anxiety or depression.

**Why does this matter?**

When children feel anxious or sad, it can cause problems. They may struggle at home with their family. They may have trouble at school. These feelings can lead to mental health problems later in life. It is important to help these children early.

**What are talking therapies?**

Talking therapies help people talk about their feelings. A trained person helps the child understand and manage their emotions. These therapies were first made for children without health problems. We do not know if they work well for children with long-term health conditions.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors and families need to know what treatments work best. This study looked at whether talking therapies can help children with long-term health problems who feel anxious or sad.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not one single study. Instead, researchers looked at many studies done by other scientists. They searched for all high-quality studies from 1970 to 2018.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included children and teens aged 18 years or younger. All of them had long-term health problems. All of them also had symptoms of anxiety or depression. A total of 1,349 young people took part across all studies.

**What did the studies look at?**

The studies tested different talking therapies. They compared these therapies to other treatments. The researchers wanted to see which treatments worked better.

**How long did the studies last?**

The length of time varied across different studies. The review looked at results from the short term.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found 29 studies to review. The overall quality of these studies was low to moderate. This means some studies were better done than others.

**What talking therapies were tested?**

Only a few types of talking therapies have been tested. Most were made for children without health problems. The most common type was called cognitive behavior therapy, or CBT. CBT helps children change negative thoughts and behaviors.

**Do talking therapies work?**

Some talking therapies do help. CBT and therapies made specifically for depression or anxiety work best. They help reduce mild symptoms of worry and sadness in the short term. The benefits are seen soon after treatment.

**What else did the study show?**

There is some evidence that young people find these therapies acceptable. This means they are willing to try them. Some studies showed that talking therapies may improve quality of life. They may also help with symptoms of the long-term health condition itself.

**What is missing?**

There are not enough therapies for health-related anxiety. This is when children worry specifically about their health condition. More work is needed in this area.

**What do the results mean?**

Talking therapies can help children with long-term health problems who feel anxious or sad. However, more research is needed. Scientists need to create better therapies designed specifically for this group of children.

**What should happen next?**

More studies should be done. New talking therapies should be developed. These should be made specifically for children with long-term health problems. Better therapies will help more children feel better.

**Who should care about these results?**

These results matter to many people. Doctors who treat mental health should know about them. Doctors who treat physical health should also know. Families of children with long-term health problems will find this helpful. People who plan health services need this information too."
10.1002-14651858.CD012584.pub2-abstract.txt,"To continue taking or to stop taking antiplatelet drugs for a few days before non‐cardiac surgery in adults 
Review question 
We set out to determine whether continuing to take antiplatelet drugs before non‐cardiac surgery that requires general, spinal or regional anaesthesia increases the risk of experiencing serious bleeding, ischaemic event or death in adults, when compared with stopping antiplatelet drugs for at least five days before non‐cardiac surgery. 
Background 
Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin or clopidogrel reduce the risk of people getting blood clots, and are routinely prescribed for people who have had coronary stents inserted. They are also recommended for people with unstable angina or heart disease, or people who have had a heart attack, heart surgery or a stroke. Taking antiplatelet therapy introduces an increased risk of bleeding, which could lead to problems if a person needs non‐cardiac surgery. Stopping usual antiplatelet therapy a few days before surgery might reduce the risk of serious bleeding during surgery. Not taking these antiplatelet drugs could, however, increase the risk of a heart attack, stroke, or death. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence from randomized controlled trials is current to January 2018. We included five trials with 666 adults in the review. Three studies are ongoing. All participants were taking antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) at the start of the study. Two studies stopped antiplatelet drugs for at least five days before surgery, and three studies gave participants a placebo instead of antiplatelet therapy during this time. 
Key results 
We found low‐certainty evidence that either continuing or stopping antiplatelet therapy may make little or no difference to the number of people who died up to 30 days or six months after surgery (five studies, 659 participants). We found moderate‐certainty evidence that either continuing or stopping antiplatelet therapy probably makes little or no difference to incidences of bleeding serious enough to need a blood transfusion during or immediately after surgery (four studies, 368 participants). We found low‐certainty evidence that either continuing or stopping antiplatelet therapy may make little or no difference to bleeding serious enough to need further surgery (four studies, 368 participants), and may make little or no difference to the number of ischaemic events such as stroke or heart attack (four studies, 616 participants). 
Quality of the evidence 
Some studies had low risk of bias because they had clearly reported their methods for randomizing people to each group, and three studies used a placebo agent so that people did not know whether or not they were continuing their usual antiplatelet therapy. However, we found few studies with few events, with wide variation in results. To continue or stop taking antiplatelet drugs for a few days before non‐cardiac surgery might make little or no difference to the number of people who died, who had bleeding that needed further surgery or who had ischaemic events, and it probably makes little or no difference to bleeding that needed a blood transfusion. We found three ongoing studies which will increase certainty in the effect in future updates of the review.

## Plain Title
Should People Keep Taking Blood Thinning Pills Before Surgery? A Review of Studies

## Rationale

**What are blood thinning pills and why do people take them?**

Some people take pills called antiplatelet drugs every day. These include aspirin and clopidogrel. These drugs help stop blood clots from forming. Doctors give these pills to people who have had heart problems, strokes, or special tubes called stents put in their heart arteries.

**What is the problem?**

When people need surgery (not on their heart), doctors face a hard choice. These blood thinning pills can cause more bleeding during surgery. But stopping the pills might cause a heart attack or stroke. Doctors need to know which choice is safer.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to find out what happens when people keep taking their blood thinning pills before surgery. They also wanted to know what happens when people stop taking these pills for a few days before surgery. This information helps doctors make better choices to keep patients safe.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at five different studies done by other scientists. They gathered all the information together to see what it showed.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included 666 adults. All of them were taking blood thinning pills (aspirin or clopidogrel). All of them needed surgery that was not on their heart.

**What did the studies compare?**

Some people kept taking their blood thinning pills before surgery. Other people stopped taking their pills at least five days before surgery. Some got fake pills (called placebos) instead during this time.

**How long did the studies last?**

Researchers watched the patients for up to 30 days or six months after their surgery.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The study found that stopping or continuing blood thinning pills before surgery may not make much difference in several important ways:

**Deaths:** About the same number of people died whether they kept taking their pills or stopped taking them. This was true up to 30 days and six months after surgery.

**Serious bleeding needing blood transfusions:** About the same number of people needed blood transfusions during or right after surgery in both groups.

**Bleeding needing more surgery:** About the same number of people needed another surgery to stop bleeding in both groups.

**Heart attacks and strokes:** About the same number of people had heart attacks or strokes in both groups.

**How strong is this evidence?**

The evidence was moderate to low quality. This means we cannot be completely sure about the results. The studies were done well in some ways. They put people into groups randomly. Some studies used fake pills so people did not know which group they were in. But there were only a few studies. Not many bad events happened in these studies. The results varied quite a bit between studies.

**What does this mean?**

Right now, the evidence suggests that stopping or continuing blood thinning pills before surgery might not make a big difference. But we need more studies to be more certain. Three more studies are happening now. These will help doctors know better what to do in the future.

**Important note:** Patients should always talk to their doctor before stopping any medicine. Each person is different. Doctors will make the best choice for each patient based on their health needs."
10.1002-14651858.CD012595.pub4-abstract.txt,"School dental screening programmes for improving oral health of children
What was the aim of this review? 
Oral health means the condition of the mouth, throat, teeth and gums. The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if school dental screening improves oral health of children; and if it does, which screening method works best. We found eight relevant studies to answer this question. This is the second update of a review that was published in December 2017 and first updated in August 2019. 
Key message 
There is not enough evidence to draw conclusions about whether traditional school dental screening can improve dental attendance (can lead to children visiting the dentist more often). Moreover, it is not clear if improvement in dental attendance leads to better oral health. We still need high‐quality studies that measure the impact of screening on oral health over longer periods of time. 
What did this review study? 
Oral diseases, especially tooth decay (called 'dental caries' by dentists), affect children worldwide. If untreated, oral health can deteriorate and negatively impact children's general well‐being. It also has a financial cost for families and society as a whole. 
School dental screening involves a dental professional examining children's mouths and teeth at school and letting parents know about their child's oral condition and treatment needs. It aims to identify oral health concerns at an early stage and prompt parents to seek treatment where required. Whether this actually improves children's oral health is the question we wanted to answer in this review. 
What were the main results of this review? 
Our updated search identified one new study to be included since the last version of the review was published. In total, the review includes eight studies that presented results for 21,290 children. Four studies took place in the UK, two in India, one in the USA and one in Saudi Arabia. The children were 4 to 15 years old. Studies looked at the oral health and dental attendance of children who were screened in school compared to children who did not have screening. Some studies also compared different ways of screening and different forms of follow‐up (e.g. advice letter or referral). 
We do not know whether traditional school dental screening improves dental attendance. Studies looking at screening based on specific criteria (e.g. targeted at children not registered with a dentist) suggested it may be slightly more effective than no screening for improving attendance at the dentist. There may be no difference between criteria‐based screening and universal screening for improving dental attendance, but we are very unsure about the results. 
A personalised or specific referral letter to parents may improve dental attendance more than a non‐specific letter, but we are very unsure about the results. 
Screening with added motivation (health education and offer of free treatment) may improve dental attendance compared to screening alone, but we are very unsure about the results. 
One study comparing different referral letters (with more or less information about dental diseases) found that neither was better than the other for improving dental treatment in children. 
A specific referral letter did not encourage more parents to take their children to the dentist when compared to a letter with generic advice to visit the dentist. 
The eight studies followed up children for 3 to 11 months after they received screening. Therefore, we do not know the effects of screening over a longer period of time. 
None of the studies checked whether there were any negative effects of screening programmes or how much they cost. 
How up to date is the review? 
We searched for published studies up to 15 October 2021.
","# Plain Language Summary: School Dental Screening Programs for Improving Children's Oral Health

## Plain Title
Do Dental Check-ups at School Help Children's Teeth and Gums Stay Healthy?

## Rationale

### What is oral health and why does it matter?
Oral health means how healthy your mouth, throat, teeth, and gums are. Many children around the world have tooth decay. This means their teeth get holes in them. When tooth decay is not treated, it can get worse. This can hurt children and make them feel unwell. It also costs families and communities a lot of money.

### What is school dental screening?
School dental screening means a dental expert looks at children's mouths and teeth at school. The expert then tells parents about their child's teeth. They explain if the child needs to see a dentist. The goal is to find tooth problems early. This might help parents take their child to the dentist sooner.

### Why was this study needed?
Researchers wanted to know if checking children's teeth at school actually helps their oral health. They also wanted to know which way of checking works best. This review looked at studies to answer these questions.

## Trial Design

### How was this review designed?
Researchers looked for studies about school dental screening. They found eight studies that tested this. These studies included 21,290 children in total.

### Who was in these studies?
The children were 4 to 15 years old. Four studies happened in the UK. Two studies happened in India. One study happened in the USA. One study happened in Saudi Arabia.

### What did the studies compare?
The studies compared children who got dental screening at school to children who did not. Some studies also tested different ways of screening. They tested different ways of telling parents about the results. For example, some parents got advice letters. Others got referral letters.

### How long did the studies last?
The studies followed children for 3 to 11 months after screening.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

**Traditional screening:** We do not know if regular school dental screening helps more children visit the dentist. There is not enough evidence to be sure.

**Targeted screening:** Screening that focuses on certain children may work slightly better. For example, screening children who do not have a dentist may help a little. But we need more studies to be certain.

**Different types of letters:** A letter that gives specific information about a child's teeth may work better than a general letter. But we are not very sure about this result.

**Screening plus extra help:** Screening combined with health education and free treatment may help more. But again, we are not very sure.

**Comparing different letters:** One study looked at letters with more or less information. Neither letter worked better than the other.

### What was not measured?
None of the studies checked if screening caused any harm. None of the studies looked at how much screening programs cost. The studies only followed children for less than one year. We do not know what happens over a longer time.

### What do these results mean?
We cannot say for sure if school dental screening improves children's oral health. We do not know if more dental visits lead to healthier teeth. We need better studies that follow children for longer periods of time.

### How current is this review?
Researchers searched for studies published up to October 15, 2021. This is the second update of a review first published in December 2017.

### What is needed next?
We need high-quality studies that measure oral health over many years. These studies should check if screening actually makes children's teeth healthier. They should also look at any problems screening might cause. They should measure how much screening costs."
10.1002-14651858.CD012626.pub2-abstract.txt,"What are the most effective ways to encourage people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to be more physically active? 
Background 
Being physically active is important for everyone's health. It can be particularly difficult for people with COPD and we do not know the best way to improve physical activity. 
Study characteristics 
This review includes 76 studies involving 8018 people with COPD (published before 27 June 2019). Most studies were funded by government bodies, although some were sponsored by equipment or drug manufacturers. Many strategies have been developed and different studies have measured physical activity in lots of different ways. This means that it was hard to compare and combine their findings. It was also hard to tell exactly what was involved in some of the interventions, and therefore which components were important for improving physical activity. 
Key results 
Some studies looked at current interventions for people with COPD, including pulmonary rehabilitation and different types of exercise training as well as self‐management and education. Other studies have looked at special types of nutritional supplements, oxygen therapy, surgery, muscle stimulation and singing. 
Some strategies that did work involved exercise training, physical activity counselling and COPD medications. Some studies showed that people did an extra 6 to 24 minutes of at least moderate‐intensity physical activity, as well as walking for longer or taking more steps each day. However, we are still uncertain about when or how these approaches should be used. Only a few studies followed people up after the intervention finished. It is not clear exactly what needs to be done to improve physical activity in the long term, which is what may be required for health benefits. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low, due to difficulties working out exactly what people did in the studies, and also because there were lots of single studies (some quite small) looking at different types of interventions. This means that it was difficult to generalise these findings to all people with COPD.

What Works Best to Help People with Lung Disease Become More Active?

## Rationale

**What is COPD?**
COPD stands for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is a long-term lung condition that makes breathing hard. People with COPD often feel short of breath.

**Why is being active important?**
Being physically active is good for everyone's health. But people with COPD often find it very hard to be active. When you cannot breathe well, moving around becomes difficult.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors do not know the best way to help people with COPD become more active. Many different approaches have been tried. This study looked at all the research to find out what works best.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Researchers wanted to find out which methods help people with COPD move more. They hoped to discover the most helpful ways to increase physical activity.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was a review study. Researchers looked at 76 different studies that had already been done. They combined the findings from all these studies.

**Who was in the studies?**
The studies included 8,018 people with COPD. The review did not specify ages or gender details.

**What did the studies test?**
The studies tested many different approaches. Some tested exercise programs and lung rehabilitation. Others tested education and self-care programs. Some studies looked at special diets, oxygen therapy, surgery, muscle stimulation, and even singing.

**How long did the studies last?**
The review did not specify how long people stayed in each study. Only a few studies checked on people after the program ended.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

Some approaches helped people with COPD become more active:
- Exercise training programs worked
- Counseling about physical activity helped
- Some COPD medicines increased activity

**How much more active did people become?**
People who got helpful treatments did more activity:
- They did 6 to 24 more minutes of moderate activity each day
- They walked longer distances
- They took more steps each day

**What is still unclear?**
Researchers are not sure about several things:
- When these approaches should be used
- How these approaches should be used
- What needs to be done for long-term results

**Why is long-term activity important?**
People may need to stay active for a long time to get health benefits. Only a few studies checked if people stayed active after the program ended.

**What made this study difficult?**
Several problems made it hard to find clear answers:
- Different studies measured activity in different ways
- It was hard to compare results across studies
- Some studies did not clearly explain what they did
- Researchers could not tell which parts of programs were most important

**How good was the evidence?**
The quality of evidence was generally low. This means we cannot be completely sure about the findings. Many studies were small. Many studies tested different things. This makes it hard to know if the results apply to all people with COPD.

**What does this mean for patients?**
Some treatments can help people with COPD become more active. Exercise programs, activity counseling, and certain medicines show promise. But more research is needed. Doctors need better information about how to help patients stay active over time.

**Conclusion**
Some strategies help people with COPD become more physically active. But researchers need more information. They need to know which approaches work best. They need to know how to help people stay active for the long term."
10.1002-14651858.CD012665.pub2-abstract.txt,"Bilateral (two) versus unilateral (one) hearing aid(s) for bilateral hearing impairment in adults 
Review question 
Should adult patients with bilateral (two‐sided) hearing loss be fitted with one or two hearing aids? 
Background 
Hearing loss can be present from birth or can come on in later life. The latter is called 'acquired' hearing loss and is common. Its incidence increases markedly with age. In most people, 'age‐related' hearing loss is due to the loss of cells in the inner ear (so called 'sensorineural hearing loss') and affects both ears to the same degree. Hearing loss categorised as mild, moderate or severe is primarily managed with hearing aids. People with bilateral hearing loss may be offered one aid, fitted to one specific ear, or two aids fitted to both ears. There is uncertainty about the relative benefits to patients of these different strategies. 
Study characteristics 
We included four studies with a total of 209 patients, ranging in age from 23 to 85 and with more men than women. All the studies allowed the use of hearing aids for a total period of at least eight weeks before questions were asked about their preference for one or two aids. In all the studies the patients had bilateral hearing loss but there was considerable variation in what type of hearing loss they suffered from and how bad their hearing was. 
Three of the studies were published before the mid‐1990s and the fourth study was published in 2011. Therefore, only the most recent study used 'modern' hearing aids similar to those that are widely available in high‐income countries. Of the four studies, two were conducted in the UK in National Health Service (NHS – public sector) patients. One of these looked at patients from primary care whose hearing loss had been picked up by a screening programme. The other looked at patients whose primary care practitioner thought they might benefit from hearing aids so had referred them to the local ENT department to get them. The other two studies were conducted in the United States: one study recruited only people on active military duty, or who had served in the military and had hearing loss due to being exposed to loud noises. About half of the people in the other study were ex‐military. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
Only one of the outcomes we thought was most important ‐ patient preference ‐ was reported in all studies. The percentage of patients who preferred two hearing aids to one varied between studies: this was 54% (51 out of 94), 39% (22 out of 56), 55% (16 out of 29) and 77% (23 out of 30), respectively. We did not combine the numbers from these four studies because it would not have been right to do so. We graded the quality of evidence for this outcome as very low on a scale that goes high – medium – low – very low. There was no information in the four studies on the other outcomes we were interested in. 
Conclusions 
This review identified only four studies comparing the use of one hearing aid with two. The studies were small and included people of widely varying ages. There was also considerable variation in the types of their deafness and in how deaf they were. 
For the most part, the types of hearing aid evaluated would now be regarded, in high‐income countries, as 'old technology', with only one study looking at 'modern' digital aids. However, we do not know if this is relevant or not. This review did not look at the differences between other 'old' and 'new' types of hearing aid. 
We could not combine the numbers from the four studies. Overall, this fact and the very low quality of the evidence leads us to conclude that we do not know if patients have a preference for one aid or two. Similarly, we do not know if a patient's quality of life is better with one or two aids. 
","# Plain Language Summary: One Hearing Aid Versus Two Hearing Aids for Adults with Hearing Loss in Both Ears

## Plain Title
Comparing One Hearing Aid to Two Hearing Aids for Adults Who Have Hearing Loss in Both Ears

## Rationale

**What is hearing loss and why does it matter?**

Many adults lose their hearing as they get older. This is called age-related hearing loss. It happens when tiny cells inside the ear stop working. Most of the time, both ears lose hearing at the same rate.

Hearing loss makes daily life harder. People may struggle to talk with family and friends. They may have trouble at work or in social settings. This can make people feel alone or sad.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors can help people with hearing loss by giving them hearing aids. When both ears have hearing loss, doctors can give one hearing aid or two hearing aids. No one knew for sure which choice was better for patients.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to know if patients prefer one hearing aid or two. They also wanted to know if two hearing aids help people live better lives than one hearing aid does.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at four different studies. These studies included 209 adults total. The people in these studies were between 23 and 85 years old. More men than women took part.

All people in the studies had hearing loss in both ears. However, different people had different types of hearing loss. Some had mild hearing loss. Others had worse hearing loss.

**What did people in the studies do?**

Each person tried using hearing aids for at least eight weeks. After that time, they answered questions. They told researchers if they liked one hearing aid or two hearing aids better.

**When were these studies done?**

Three studies happened before the mid-1990s. One study happened in 2011. Only the newest study used modern digital hearing aids. The older studies used hearing aids that are now out of date.

**Where did these studies take place?**

Two studies happened in the United Kingdom. These used patients from the public health system. One study found patients through a hearing test program. The other study used patients sent by their regular doctors.

Two studies happened in the United States. One study only included people in the military. Many people in the other study had also been in the military.

## Results

**What did the studies find?**

The studies asked people which they preferred: one hearing aid or two hearing aids.

The results were different in each study:
- In the first study, 51 out of 94 people liked two aids better
- In the second study, 22 out of 56 people liked two aids better
- In the third study, 16 out of 29 people liked two aids better
- In the fourth study, 23 out of 30 people liked two aids better

**Why couldn't researchers combine all the results?**

The four studies were too different from each other. The people had different types of hearing loss. They used different types of hearing aids. The studies were done at different times.

**What does this mean for patients?**

We cannot say for sure if one hearing aid or two hearing aids is better. The studies were too small. The quality of information was very low. The hearing aids used were mostly old types.

The studies did not tell us if people's lives got better with one aid or two aids. They did not measure quality of life.

**What do we still need to know?**

We need bigger studies with more people. We need studies using modern hearing aids. We need to know if two aids help people live better lives. We need to know if the benefits are worth the extra cost of two aids.

**Main conclusion**

Right now, we do not have enough good information. We cannot tell patients if one hearing aid or two hearing aids works better. More research is needed to answer this important question."

What is Crohn's disease? 
Crohn’s disease is a long‐term condition that results in inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, occurring anywhere from the mouth to the anus. Common symptoms include fever, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and weight loss. Crohn's disease is characterized by periods of relapse when people are actively experiencing symptoms and periods of remission when the symptoms stop. 
What are Cannabis and Cannabinoids? 
Cannabis is a widely used drug which acts on the endocannabinoid system. Cannabis contains multiple components called cannabinoids. The use of cannabis and cannabis oil containing specific cannabinoids produces mental and physical effects such as altered sensory perception and euphoria when consumed. Some cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol, do not have a psychoactive effect. Cannabis and cannabidiol have some anti‐inflammatory properties that might help people with Crohn's disease. 
What did the researchers investigate? 
The researchers studied whether cannabis is better than placebo (e.g. a sugar pill) therapy for treating adults with active Crohn's disease or Crohn's disease that is in remission. 
What did the researchers find? 
The researchers extensively searched the literature up to 17 October 2018 and found three studies (93 participants) that met the inclusion criteria. One ongoing study was also identified. All of the studies were small in size and had some quality issues. One small study (21 participants) compared eight weeks of treatment with cannabis cigarettes containing 115 mg of D9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to placebo cigarettes containing cannabis with the THC removed in participants with active Crohn's disease who had failed at least one medical treatment. Although no difference in clinical remission rates was observed, more participants in the cannabis group had improvement in their Crohn's disease symptoms than participants in the placebo group. More side effects were observed in the cannabis cigarette group compared to placebo. These side effects were considered to be mild in nature and included sleepiness, nausea, difficulty with concentration, memory loss, confusion and dizziness. Participants in the cannabis cigarette group reported improvements in pain, appetite and satisfaction with treatment. 
One small study (22 participants) compared cannabis oil (10 mg of cannabidiol twice daily) to placebo oil (i.e. olive oil) in participants with active Crohn's disease who had failed at least one medical treatment. No difference in clinical remission rates was observed. There was no difference in serious side effects. Serious side effects included worsening Crohn's disease in one participant in each group. 
One small study (50 participants) compared cannabis oil (composed of 15% cannabidiol and 4% THC) to placebo oil in participants with active Crohn's disease. Positive differences in quality of life and the Crohn's disease activity index were observed. 
Conclusions 
The effects of cannabis and cannabis oil on Crohn's disease are uncertain. No firm conclusions regarding the benefits and harms (e.g. side effects) of cannabis and cannabis oil in adults with Crohn's disease can be drawn. The effects of cannabis and cannabis oil in people with Crohn's disease in remission have not been investigated. Further studies with larger numbers of participants are required to assess the potential benefits and harms of cannabis in Crohn's disease. Future studies should assess the effects of cannabis in people with active and inactive Crohn's disease. Different doses of cannabis and formulations (e.g. cannabis oil or pills) should be investigated. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Cannabis and Cannabis Oil for Crohn's Disease

## Plain Title
Can Cannabis or Cannabis Oil Help Treat Crohn's Disease?

## Rationale

**What is Crohn's disease?**

Crohn's disease is a long-term health problem. It causes swelling in the gut. This swelling can happen anywhere from the mouth to the bottom. People with Crohn's disease may have fever, loose stools, belly pain, and weight loss. The disease comes and goes. Sometimes people feel sick with symptoms. Other times they feel better with no symptoms.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Cannabis is a drug that many people use. It contains parts called cannabinoids. Some cannabinoids can change how people feel and see things. Other cannabinoids do not cause these effects. Cannabis may help reduce swelling in the body. Because Crohn's disease causes swelling in the gut, researchers wanted to see if cannabis could help people with this disease. They wanted to know if cannabis works better than a fake treatment.

**Why is this study needed?**

People with Crohn's disease need better treatment options. Cannabis might help reduce swelling and improve symptoms. This study was needed to find out if cannabis is safe and helpful for people with Crohn's disease.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked for all studies about cannabis and Crohn's disease. They searched up to October 2018. They found three small studies with 93 people total. They also found one study still happening.

**Who was in the studies?**

All studies included adults with Crohn's disease. These people had tried at least one other treatment that did not work. Some people had active disease with symptoms. The studies did not include people whose disease was quiet.

**What did the studies test?**

One study gave 21 people either cannabis cigarettes or fake cigarettes for eight weeks. The cannabis cigarettes had a part called THC. The fake cigarettes had cannabis with the THC removed.

Another study gave 22 people either cannabis oil or olive oil for a period of time. The cannabis oil had a part called cannabidiol.

A third study gave 50 people either cannabis oil or fake oil. This cannabis oil had both cannabidiol and THC.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The studies were small and had some problems with how they were done. This makes it hard to trust the results fully.

**Study 1 findings:**

People who smoked cannabis cigarettes did not go into remission more than people who smoked fake cigarettes. Remission means the disease becomes quiet. But more people who used cannabis felt their symptoms got better. They had less pain and felt hungrier. They were more happy with their treatment.

More people who smoked cannabis had side effects. These side effects were mild. They included feeling sleepy, feeling sick to the stomach, trouble thinking clearly, forgetting things, feeling confused, and feeling dizzy.

**Study 2 findings:**

People who took cannabis oil did not go into remission more than people who took olive oil. One person in each group had serious side effects. Their Crohn's disease got worse.

**Study 3 findings:**

People who took cannabis oil felt better in their daily life. Their disease activity scores improved.

**What do these results mean?**

We cannot say for sure if cannabis or cannabis oil helps people with Crohn's disease. The studies were too small. They had quality problems. We need bigger and better studies to know if cannabis is safe and helpful.

**What is still unknown?**

No studies looked at people whose Crohn's disease was quiet. We do not know the best dose of cannabis to use. We do not know which form works best. More research is needed to answer these questions.

**Conclusions:**

Right now, we cannot say if cannabis helps or harms people with Crohn's disease. Larger studies are needed. Future studies should test different doses and forms of cannabis. They should include people with active disease and quiet disease."
10.1002-14651858.CD012948-abstract.txt,"Planned birth at or near term for improving health outcomes for pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes and their infants 
What is the issue? 
The aim of this Cochrane review was to find out if planning an elective birth at or near the term of pregnancy, compared to waiting for labour to start spontaneously, has an impact on the health of women with diabetes and the health of their babies. This review focuses on women who have diabetes before becoming pregnant (pre‐existing diabetes). Elective birth is carried out either by induction of labour or caesarean section, and 'at or near term' means 37 to 40 weeks' gestation. 
To answer this question, we searched for all relevant studies (date of search: 15 August 2017), with the aim of collecting and analysing them together. 
Why is this important? 
When women with diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2) become pregnant they are at higher risk of complications than women who do not have diabetes. For example, their babies may be larger and have a higher risk of death in the later weeks of pregnancy. Because of these risks, many clinicians have recommended that women with diabetes have an elective birth (usually by induction) at or near term (37 to 40 weeks' gestation), rather than waiting for labour to start spontaneously or until 41 weeks' gestation if all is well. Induction has the disadvantage of increasing the incidence of forceps or ventouse births, and women often find it difficult to cope with an induced labour. Caesarean section is a major operation which can lead to blood loss, infections and increased chance of problems with subsequence births. Early birth can increase the chance of breathing problems for babies. It is important to know which approach to birth has a better impact on the health outcomes of women with pre‐existing diabetes and their babies. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found no studies that addressed our specific question.
What does this mean? 
In the absence of randomised studies, we are unable to say if women with pre‐existing diabetes and their babies experience better health outcomes if they have a planned birth (by induction of labour or caesarean section at 37 to 40 weeks' gestation) compared to waiting for labour to begin spontaneously or until 41 weeks' gestation if all is well. More research is needed to answer this question. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Does Planning Birth Early Help Pregnant Women with Diabetes and Their Babies?

## Rationale

**What is diabetes in pregnancy?**

Some women have diabetes before they get pregnant. Diabetes is a condition where the body cannot control blood sugar levels properly. There are two main types: Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.

**Why is this a concern?**

When women with diabetes become pregnant, they face more risks than women without diabetes. Their babies may grow very large. Sadly, these babies have a higher chance of dying in the last weeks of pregnancy. These risks make pregnancy harder for women with diabetes.

**What do doctors currently do?**

Because of these risks, many doctors suggest that women with diabetes have their baby early. This is called ""planned birth"" or ""elective birth."" It happens between 37 and 40 weeks of pregnancy. Doctors either start labor with medicine (called induction) or do surgery (called caesarean section). This is different from waiting for labor to start on its own, which might happen around 41 weeks.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Researchers wanted to know which approach is better. Does planning birth early help mothers and babies stay healthier? Or is it better to wait for labor to start naturally? Each approach has risks. Induction can lead to difficult labor. Women may need help from tools like forceps. Caesarean section is major surgery. It can cause bleeding and infections. Early birth can cause breathing problems for babies. Researchers needed to find out which choice leads to better health for mothers and babies.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers look for answers?**

Researchers searched for all studies done on this topic. They looked for studies up to August 15, 2017. They wanted to find studies that compared two groups of pregnant women with diabetes. One group would have planned birth between 37 and 40 weeks. The other group would wait for labor to start naturally.

**What kind of studies did they look for?**

They looked for the best type of study. This is called a randomized study. In these studies, women are put into groups by chance. This helps make sure the results are fair and accurate.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found no studies that answered their question. Not a single study compared planned early birth to waiting for natural labor in women with pre-existing diabetes.

**What does this mean?**

Without any studies, we cannot say which approach is better. We do not know if planned birth between 37 and 40 weeks helps women with diabetes and their babies. We also do not know if waiting for natural labor is safer.

**Why is this important?**

Doctors and women with diabetes need good information to make decisions. Right now, that information does not exist. Different doctors may give different advice. Women may not know what choice is best for them and their babies.

**What happens next?**

More research is urgently needed. Scientists need to do studies that compare these two approaches. These studies should look at health outcomes for both mothers and babies. They should measure things like baby deaths, breathing problems, and surgery complications. They should also ask mothers about their experiences.

**The bottom line:**

We need more research to know the best time for women with pre-existing diabetes to have their babies. Until we have this research, women and their doctors must make decisions without clear evidence."

Review question 
What are the effects of medical interventions for chronic rhinosinusitis on people with cystic fibrosis? 
Background 
Chronic rhinosinusitis is long‐term infection and inflammation of the nasal cavity and air‐filled spaces around the eyes and nose. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that makes secretions in the body thick, and hence stagnant. When this occurs in and around the nose, it causes chronic rhinosinusitis. Better care of people with cystic fibrosis has led to them living longer, increasing the chance of developing chronic rhinosinusitis. Early and effective interventions with antibiotics, steroids, drugs that thin the mucus (e.g. dornase alfa) and drugs to improve how the cell membrane channel functions (CFTR modulators) can help to improve quality of life and prevent the development of lower airway disease. Currently, there are no guidelines based on trials to know how best to treat chronic rhinosinusitis in people with cystic fibrosis. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 09 September 2021.
Study characteristics 
We found no trials in our search that met our inclusion criteria. We have listed 12 trials as excluded and one trial as ongoing in the current review. 
Key results 
Although chronic rhinosinusitis is common in people with cystic fibrosis, there is not enough evidence available on its management. This review highlights the need for well‐designed trials assessing which treatment is best for managing chronic rhinosinusitis, preventing lower airway disease and improving quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
A Review of Medical Treatments for Long-Term Nose and Sinus Inflammation in People with Cystic Fibrosis

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some people with cystic fibrosis get long-term swelling and infection in their nose and sinuses. This is called chronic rhinosinusitis. The sinuses are air-filled spaces around the eyes and nose.

**What causes this problem?**

Cystic fibrosis is a disease you are born with. It makes the body's fluids thick and sticky. These thick fluids cannot move well. When this happens in the nose and sinuses, it causes infection and swelling that lasts a long time.

**Why is this a problem for patients?**

This nose and sinus problem makes life harder for people with cystic fibrosis. It can make them feel unwell. It may also lead to lung problems later.

**Why was this study needed?**

People with cystic fibrosis now live longer than before because of better care. This means more people develop this nose and sinus problem. Doctors need to know the best way to treat it. Right now, there are no clear guidelines based on research studies.

**What treatments might help?**

Several treatments might help people with this problem:
- Antibiotics fight infection
- Steroids reduce swelling
- Drugs that thin mucus help it drain better
- Special drugs called CFTR modulators help cells work better

These treatments could help people feel better. They might also stop lung disease from developing.

## Trial Design

**How was this review designed?**

The researchers looked for studies that tested medical treatments. They wanted to find studies about treating nose and sinus problems in people with cystic fibrosis.

**What did the researchers search for?**

They searched for studies up to September 9, 2021. They looked for any age group. They looked for both males and females. They wanted studies about people with cystic fibrosis who had chronic rhinosinusitis.

**What did they find?**

The researchers found no studies that met their needs. They looked at 12 studies but had to exclude them all. These studies did not fit what they were looking for. They found one study that is still ongoing.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The review found no completed studies to analyze. This means there is not enough evidence about how to treat this condition.

**What does this mean for patients?**

Many people with cystic fibrosis have nose and sinus problems. But doctors do not have enough research to guide treatment. More studies are needed.

**What are the main conclusions?**

This review shows an important gap in medical knowledge. Researchers need to do well-designed studies. These studies should test which treatments work best. They should look at:
- Which treatment helps the most
- How to prevent lung disease
- How to improve quality of life

**Why is this important?**

Without good research, doctors cannot be sure they are giving the best treatment. People with cystic fibrosis deserve to know what works best for their nose and sinus problems.

**What happens next?**

More research studies are needed. These studies should compare different treatments. They should measure how well people feel. They should check if treatments prevent other health problems.

Until more research is done, doctors must make treatment choices without clear guidelines. This review highlights the urgent need for more studies in this area."
10.1002-14651858.CD013057.pub2-abstract.txt,"Benefits and risks of ear cleaning for people with chronic suppurative otitis media (persistent or recurring ear infection with discharge of pus) 
Why this is important 
Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), also known as chronic otitis media (COM), is an inflammation and infection of the middle ear that lasts for two weeks or more. People with CSOM usually experience recurrent or persistent ear discharge – pus that leaks out from a hole in the eardrum – and hearing loss. 
Different approaches can be used to clean the affected ears and remove discharge. These include: 
‐ using cotton wool or tissue paper (dry mopping);‐ sucking up material blocking the ear with a small device (usually done under a microscope); or‐ washing out the ear (irrigation). 
To find out how effective ear cleaning is in people with CSOM, and whether it causes unwanted effects, we reviewed the evidence from research studies. In particular, we wanted to know whether ear cleaning stopped ear discharge, and whether it affected health‐related quality of life, or hearing. We also wanted to know if it caused pain, discomfort or irritation in the ear, unwanted effects such as dizziness or ear bleeding, or any serious complications. 
How we identified and assessed the evidence 
First, we searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. We considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. 
What we found 
We found three studies in 431 people with CSOM. People were followed for between six weeks and six months after treatment. 
The studies compared:
‐ daily dry mopping versus no treatment (two studies, 351 people);‐ daily suction combined with antibiotic ear drops administered in a clinic, versus one instance of suction only (in a clinic) followed by daily self‐administered antibiotic ear drops (one study, 80 people). 
Daily dry mopping compared against no treatment 
‐ We do not know whether dry mopping stops ear discharge, because the evidence on whether people experienced discharge after four weeks was of very low certainty, and no studies looked at the presence of discharge earlier. 
‐ One study reported serious complications, but it was not clear whether the people who reported complications had their ears cleaned with dry mopping or not, or whether the complications occurred before or after treatment. We therefore could not tell whether dry mopping caused serious complications, or how often these occurred. 
‐ One study looked at hearing, but did not report the results in a way that could tell us whether or not dry mopping affects hearing. 
‐ No studies investigated the impact of dry mopping on health‐related quality of life, ear pain, dizziness or ear bleeding. 
Daily suction compared against one instance of suction only, in addition to antibiotic ear drops 
‐ We do not know whether suction stops ear discharge, because the evidence for between one and two weeks after treatment was of very low certainty, and the results for discharge after four weeks could not be interpreted. 
‐ We do not know if suction affects hearing or dizziness, as the evidence was of very low certainty. 
‐ No studies investigated the impact of suction on health‐related quality of life, ear pain, serious complications or ear bleeding. 
What this means 
We do not know how effective ear cleaning is for people with CSOM, and whether it causes unwanted effects. There are very few studies in this area, and these provide very low‐certainty evidence. Unwanted effects were not well reported in the studies we found. We need researchers to conduct future studies that compare ear cleaning to no cleaning, and compare different cleaning techniques and frequency, so that we can assess the benefits and risks of ear cleaning for people with CSOM. 
How‐up‐to date is this review? 
The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to March 2020.
","# Plain Language Summary: Ear Cleaning for People with Long-Lasting Ear Infections

## Plain Title

Does Cleaning the Ear Help People with Long-Lasting Ear Infections That Leak Pus?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some people get ear infections that do not go away. Doctors call this chronic suppurative otitis media, or CSOM. People with CSOM have an infection in the middle part of their ear. This infection lasts for two weeks or longer.

**What happens to people with this condition?**

People with CSOM have pus that leaks out of their ear. The pus comes through a hole in their eardrum. Many people also cannot hear as well as before.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Doctors often clean the ears of people with CSOM. They want to remove the pus and other material. Doctors use different ways to clean ears:
- Wiping with cotton or tissue (called dry mopping)
- Using a small tool to suck out the pus
- Washing out the ear with water

Researchers wanted to know if ear cleaning helps people with CSOM. They also wanted to know if ear cleaning causes any problems. They looked for studies that tested ear cleaning in people with CSOM.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

They wanted to know if ear cleaning:
- Stops the pus from leaking
- Helps people hear better
- Improves how people feel about their health
- Causes pain or discomfort
- Causes problems like dizziness or bleeding
- Causes serious health problems

## Trial Design

**How did researchers find and check the studies?**

Researchers looked for all studies about ear cleaning for CSOM. They read the studies carefully. They checked how well each study was done. They looked at the size of each study. They checked if different studies found the same results.

**What studies did they find?**

Researchers found three studies. These studies included 431 people with CSOM. The studies watched people for six weeks to six months after treatment.

**What did the studies compare?**

Two studies compared:
- Cleaning ears with dry mopping every day
- Not cleaning ears at all
- These studies included 351 people

One study compared:
- Daily ear cleaning by suction at a clinic, plus antibiotic ear drops
- One-time ear cleaning by suction at a clinic, then daily ear drops at home
- This study included 80 people

## Results

**What did researchers learn about dry mopping?**

Researchers could not tell if dry mopping helps stop pus from leaking. The information from studies was not clear enough. Studies did not check if pus stopped in the first few weeks.

One study reported serious health problems. But researchers could not tell if these problems happened because of ear cleaning. They also could not tell when the problems happened.

One study looked at hearing. But it did not report results in a clear way. Researchers could not tell if dry mopping helps hearing.

No studies looked at:
- How people feel about their health
- Ear pain
- Dizziness
- Ear bleeding

**What did researchers learn about suction cleaning?**

Researchers could not tell if suction helps stop pus from leaking. The information was not clear enough.

Researchers could not tell if suction affects hearing or causes dizziness. The information was not good enough.

No studies looked at:
- How people feel about their health
- Ear pain
- Serious health problems
- Ear bleeding

**What does this mean?**

We do not know if ear cleaning helps people with CSOM. We do not know if it causes problems. There are very few studies. The studies that exist do not give clear answers.

**What needs to happen next?**

We need more studies. These studies should compare:
- Cleaning ears versus not cleaning ears
- Different ways to clean ears
- How often to clean ears

These studies will help us learn if ear cleaning helps people with CSOM. They will also help us learn if ear cleaning is safe.

**How current is this information?**

Researchers looked for studies up to March 2020."
10.1002-14651858.CD013069.pub2-abstract.txt,"Cognitive training for people with mild to moderate dementia
Background 
Dementia due to Alzheimer’s and other diseases is a leading cause of disability and an enormous health and societal problem. More than 40 million people in the world currently live with dementia, and this number is expected to increase to more than 115 million by the year 2050. Effective treatments to reduce the burden of dementia are urgently needed. Cognitive training (CT) is a non‐pharmacological form of treatment that focuses on guided practice on tasks that target specific cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, or problem‐solving. Whether CT can help people with mild to moderate dementia maintain or improve their thinking, well‐being, and general functioning remains unclear. 
Main findings 
We analysed data from 33 studies of CT that included a total of approximately 2000 participants and were conducted in 12 countries. We found that, compared with receiving usual treatment or engaging in non‐specific activities, people completing CT may show some benefits in overall cognition, as well as in more specific cognitive abilities such as verbal fluency, and that improvements may last for at least a few months. We did not find any evidence that participating in CT was associated with increased burden for participants. However, we also found no evidence that CT was better than participating in other active treatments. 
Limitations of this review 
The quality of the studies we reviewed varied but overall was not very high, so our certainty in some of these findings is low. Future studies should continue improving on quality, should continue comparing CT with other treatments, and should follow participants for a longer period to understand whether observed benefits for cognition last beyond the short or medium term.

Can Brain Training Help People with Mild to Moderate Dementia?

## Rationale

**What is dementia and why is it important?**

Dementia is a brain condition that makes it hard for people to think, remember, and do daily tasks. More than 40 million people around the world have dementia today. By the year 2050, more than 115 million people may have it. Dementia is caused by diseases like Alzheimer's. It affects not just the person who has it, but also their families and communities.

**What is cognitive training?**

Cognitive training is a type of treatment that does not use drugs. Instead, people practice tasks that help their brain work better. These tasks focus on things like memory, paying attention, and solving problems. A trained person guides them through these tasks.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors need to find better ways to help people with dementia. Right now, it is not clear if cognitive training can help people with mild to moderate dementia. The researchers wanted to find out if this type of brain training could help people think better, feel better, and do daily tasks more easily.

The researchers looked at 33 different studies that had already been done. These studies were from 12 different countries around the world. In total, about 2000 people took part in these studies.

**Who was in the studies?**

All the people in the studies had mild to moderate dementia. This means their dementia was not very severe yet.

**What did the studies compare?**

The researchers compared people who did cognitive training with people who did not. Some people got their usual care. Some people did other activities that were not specific brain training. Some people did other active treatments.

**How long did the studies last?**

The length of time varied across the different studies.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found some good news about cognitive training:

People who did cognitive training may have shown some improvement in their overall thinking skills. They also may have gotten better at specific things, like finding and using words. These improvements may have lasted for at least a few months after the training ended.

The researchers did not find that cognitive training caused any harm or extra burden for the people who did it.

However, the researchers also found that cognitive training was not clearly better than other active treatments.

**What does this mean?**

Cognitive training might help some people with dementia think a bit better. It appears to be safe. But we still need more information to know for sure how helpful it is.

**What were the problems with this review?**

The quality of the studies was not very high overall. Some studies were done better than others. Because of this, the researchers cannot be completely certain about all their findings.

**What needs to happen next?**

Future studies need to be done more carefully. They should compare cognitive training with other treatments. They should also follow people for a longer time. This will help us know if the benefits last for many months or years, not just a short time.

**Conclusion**

Cognitive training may help people with mild to moderate dementia improve their thinking skills. It seems to be safe. But we need better studies to be more sure about these findings and to know if the benefits last a long time."
10.1002-14651858.CD013079.pub3-abstract.txt,"Antibiotic treatments for long‐term Burkholderia cepacia infections in people with cystic fibrosis 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for long‐term antibiotic treatments for people with cystic fibrosis who are infected with Burkholderia cepacia complex (bacteria composed of at least 20 different species). 
Background 
People with cystic fibrosis often suffer from repeated chest infections and eventually their lungs become permanently infected by bacteria, such as a family of bacteria called Burkholderia cepacia complex which can cause problems because many antibiotics do not work against them and they can cause a quicker deterioration in lung disease. We wanted to discover whether using long‐term antibiotic treatment was beneficial for people with cystic fibrosis and Burkholderia cepacia complex infection. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 12 April 2021.
Study characteristics 
This review included one study of 100 people aged between 6 and 57 years old. The study compared an inhaled antibiotic called aztreonam to placebo (a substance which contains no medication) and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly (by chance). The study lasted 52 weeks. 
Key results 
The only study included in this review found inhaled aztreonam had no beneficial effect on lung function or rates of chest infections in people with cystic fibrosis and Burkholderia cepacia complex infection. There was no difference between groups in relation to the average time to the next exacerbation or the number of people hospitalised for an exacerbation. Overall adverse events were similar between groups and with regards to other outcomes assessed, there was no difference between treatment groups for mortality, quality of life or sputum density. More research is needed to establish if other inhaled antibiotics may be useful. 
Quality of the evidence 
Overall quality of evidence was considered to be moderate across all outcomes, which means further research is likely to have an important impact on results. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Long-Term Antibiotic Treatment for Lung Infections in People with Cystic Fibrosis

## Plain Title
Does long-term antibiotic treatment help people with cystic fibrosis who have a lung infection called Burkholderia cepacia?

## Rationale

**What is cystic fibrosis and why is it a problem?**

People with cystic fibrosis get lung infections over and over again. After a while, germs stay in their lungs all the time. One type of germ is called Burkholderia cepacia complex. This is a family of at least 20 different germs.

**Why is this germ a problem?**

This germ causes serious problems for people with cystic fibrosis. Most antibiotics do not kill these germs. The germs can make lung disease get worse faster. This makes it harder for people to breathe.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors wanted to know if giving antibiotics for a long time would help. They wanted to see if this treatment could help people with cystic fibrosis who have this germ in their lungs. The goal was to find out if long-term antibiotics could make people feel better and keep their lungs healthier.

## Trial Design

**How was this study set up?**

This study included 100 people. They were between 6 and 57 years old. All of them had cystic fibrosis. All of them had Burkholderia cepacia complex germs in their lungs.

**What did people in the study do?**

The study tested an antibiotic called aztreonam. People breathed it in through their mouth. The study split people into two groups by chance. One group breathed in the antibiotic. The other group breathed in a placebo. A placebo looks the same but has no medicine in it.

**How long did the study last?**

The study lasted 52 weeks. That is about one year.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The antibiotic did not help people in this study. Here is what the researchers found:

**Lung function:** The antibiotic did not make breathing better. It did not improve how well the lungs worked.

**Chest infections:** People got chest infections at the same rate in both groups. The antibiotic did not prevent new infections.

**Time to next infection flare-up:** Both groups waited about the same amount of time before their next bad infection. The antibiotic did not make people wait longer.

**Hospital stays:** About the same number of people went to the hospital in both groups. The antibiotic did not keep people out of the hospital.

**Side effects:** Both groups had about the same number of side effects. The antibiotic was not more harmful than the placebo.

**Other findings:** The study looked at other things too. They found no difference between groups for:
- How many people died
- Quality of life (how good people felt day to day)
- Amount of germs in mucus from the lungs

**What does this mean?**

This inhaled antibiotic did not help people with cystic fibrosis who have this type of germ. More studies are needed. Other antibiotics that people breathe in might work better.

**How good was this study?**

The quality of this study was moderate. This means the results are fairly trustworthy. But more research could change what we know. More studies would help doctors know for sure what works best.

**What happens next?**

Doctors need to do more research. They need to test other antibiotics. They need to find treatments that work against these hard-to-kill germs. This will help people with cystic fibrosis live healthier lives."

What is the aim of this Cochrane review? 
To find out the best treatment for decreased kidney function (hepatorenal syndrome) in people with liver cirrhosis (a form of advanced liver disease with scarring of the liver) with complications. The authors collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 25 randomised controlled trials (participants receive the treatment based on method similar to coin toss or lottery; this is to ensure that the people who receive the different treatments are similar in all aspects except the treatment, so that any differences in the results between the treatments can be attributed to the treatment rather than differences in the type of people who received the treatment). During analysis of data, authors used standard Cochrane techniques, which allows comparison of two treatments at a time. Authors also used advanced techniques, that allow comparison of many treatments at the same time (usually referred as 'network meta‐analysis' or 'multiple treatment comparisons'). The aim is to gather reliable evidence on the relative benefits and harms of the different treatments. 
Date of literature search December 2018 
Key messages Only two studies were conducted well. The remaining studies had one or more flaws. Therefore, there is high uncertainty in the results of the analysis. The authors could not recommend one treatment over another on the basis of risk of death, serious complications, percentage of people who developed any complication, percentage of participants who underwent liver transplantation (replacement of a diseased liver with a healthy one), or the number of other liver failure events. Health‐related quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. The number of complications of any severity was lower with albumin plus noradrenaline than albumin plus terlipressin. Recovery from hepatorenal syndrome may be lower with albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide and albumin alone than albumin plus terlipressin and albumin plus noradrenaline. 
Funding source was unclear in 18 studies. Industrial organisations funded two studies and the remaining five studies did not receive any funding from industrial organisations. 
What was studied in the review? 
This review studied people of any sex, age, and origin, having advanced liver disease due to various causes, and who had developed hepatorenal syndrome. People were administered different treatments. The review authors excluded studies with liver‐transplanted participants. Participants age, when reported, ranged from 42 to 60 years. The number of females ranged from 6 to 62 out of 100 in the studies that reported this information. The main treatments compared were albumin alone, albumin plus terlipressin, and albumin plus noradrenaline. The authors gathered and analysed data on death, quality of life, serious and non‐serious complications, time to liver transplantation, recovery from hepatorenal syndrome, and disappearance of symptoms. 
What were the main results of the review? 
The 25 studies included a small number of participants (1263 participants). Study data were sparse. Twenty‐three studies with 1185 participants provided data for analyses. The follow‐up in the trials ranged from one week to six months. The review shows that: 
‐ About 60 out of every 100 people died within three months, and 35 out of every 100 people recovered from hepatorenal syndrome. 
‐ The provided treatment may make no difference to the percentage of people who died or developed serious complications, number of serious complications per person, percentage of people who developed complications of any severity, or the percentage of people undergoing liver transplantation. 
‐ None of the trials reported health‐related quality of life.
‐ The number of complications of any severity was lower with albumin plus noradrenaline than albumin plus terlipressin. 
‐ Recovery from hepatorenal syndrome may be lower with albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide and albumin alone than albumin plus terlipressin and albumin plus noradrenaline. 
‐ We have very low confidence in the overall results.
‐ Future trials with proper design and quality are needed to clarify the best treatment for people with advanced liver disease having hepatorenal syndrome. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Treatment for Kidney Problems in People with Advanced Liver Disease

## Plain Title
Comparing treatments for kidney failure in people with severe liver scarring

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some people have liver cirrhosis. This means their liver has severe scarring. The liver cannot work well. When the liver fails, the kidneys can also stop working properly. This is called hepatorenal syndrome.

**Why is this a problem for patients?**

When both the liver and kidneys fail, patients become very sick. About 60 out of 100 people with this problem die within three months. Patients may need a liver transplant. This means replacing their sick liver with a healthy one from a donor.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors use different treatments for hepatorenal syndrome. They were not sure which treatment works best. This study looked at all the research to find the best treatment.

**What treatments were studied?**

Doctors tested several treatments:
- Albumin alone (a protein given through a vein)
- Albumin plus terlipressin (a medicine that tightens blood vessels)
- Albumin plus noradrenaline (another medicine that tightens blood vessels)
- Albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide (two other medicines)

These treatments aim to help the kidneys work better. They may help patients recover or live longer.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers found 25 studies. These studies tested different treatments. The studies used a lottery method to assign treatments. This means patients got treatments by chance, like a coin toss. This makes the results fair.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included 1,263 people total. These people had:
- Advanced liver disease with scarring
- Kidney problems from liver failure
- Ages between 42 and 60 years old
- Both men and women (6 to 62 women out of every 100 people)

The studies did not include people who already had a liver transplant.

**How long did the studies last?**

People stayed in the studies from one week to six months. Most studies followed patients for about three months.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers looked at 23 studies with 1,185 people. They found:

**Death rates:**
- About 60 out of 100 people died within three months
- The different treatments did not clearly reduce deaths
- All treatments had similar death rates

**Recovery from kidney failure:**
- About 35 out of 100 people recovered
- Albumin plus terlipressin may help more people recover
- Albumin plus noradrenaline may also help recovery
- Albumin alone helped fewer people recover
- Albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide helped fewer people recover

**Side effects:**
- Serious problems happened with all treatments
- Albumin plus noradrenaline caused fewer total side effects than albumin plus terlipressin
- The treatments did not clearly differ in serious side effects

**Liver transplants:**
- The treatments did not change how many people needed transplants

**Quality of life:**
- None of the studies measured how patients felt in daily life

**How reliable are these results?**

The researchers have very low confidence in the results. Most studies had problems with how they were done. Only two studies were done well. More research is needed.

**What does this mean?**

Researchers cannot recommend one treatment over another. The evidence is not strong enough. Albumin plus terlipressin or albumin plus noradrenaline may help kidneys recover better than albumin alone. But we need better studies to be sure.

**What happens next?**

Doctors need to do better studies. These studies should include more patients. They should measure what matters to patients. They should follow patients longer. This will help find the best treatment for hepatorenal syndrome.

**Study funding:**

Most studies (18 out of 25) did not report their funding source. Drug companies paid for two studies. Five studies had no drug company funding."
10.1002-14651858.CD013157.pub2-pls.txt,"Nutritional supplementation for people with non‐alcohol‐related fatty liver disease
What is the aim of this Cochrane Review?To find out if any form of nutritional supplementation decreases effects of non‐alcohol‐related fatty liver disease on lifespan, health‐related quality of life, chronic liver disease, and its complications, and whether nutritional supplementation causes any harm. 
Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an accumulation of fat in the liver of people who have no history of significant alcohol consumption, use of medicines, disease such as hepatitis C virus infection, or other conditions such as starvation that can damage the liver. Fatty liver can lead to liver damage resulting in inflammation (non‐alcohol‐related steatohepatitis, or NASH) or liver scarring (liver cirrhosis). Various medical treatments have been tried for treatment of NAFLD. However, no current evidence suggests that any of them work. Nutritional supplementation has the potential to decrease liver damage, but whether this occurs is currently unclear. The authors of this review collected and analysed all relevant randomised clinical trials with the aim of finding out what is the best treatment. They found 202 randomised clinical trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups). During analysis of data, review authors used standard Cochrane methods, which allow comparison of only two treatments at a time. In addition, review authors used advanced techniques that allow comparison of multiple treatments at the same time (usually referred as 'network (or indirect) meta‐analysis'). 
Date of literature searchFebruary 2021. 
Key messagesOnly 19 trials were at low risk of bias, and because of this, uncertainty about the findings of this review is considerable. Studies that reported clinically important liver damage or its complications studied participants for a period of 2 months to 28 months. During this period, clinically important outcomes related to NAFLD such as death, liver‐related complications such as liver cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), liver decompensation (complications caused by scarring of the liver), liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), and death due to liver disease were rare, even without any treatment. No evidence suggests that any nutritional supplementation decreased these. A possible reason for complications of liver disease being rare in trial participants may be the short follow‐up period given in these trials (participants were followed only for a period of 2 months to 28 months). Liver‐related complications due to NAFLD develop over 8 to 28 years. Therefore, it is unlikely that differences in clinical outcomes can be noted in trials with less than 5 to 10 years of follow‐up. 
What was studied in the Review?This Review looked at people of any sex, age, and ethnic origin, with non‐alcohol‐related liver disease. Review authors excluded studies of people with previous liver transplantation. The average age of participants, when reported, ranged from 7 to 61 years. Participants were given different treatments including various vitamins and other nutritional supplements. Review authors wanted to gather and analyse data on death, quality of life, serious and non‐serious adverse events, severe liver damage, complications resulting from severe liver damage, liver cancer, and death due to liver damage ('clinical outcomes').What were the main results of the Review?The 202 studies included 14,200 participants. Study data were sparse. In all, 115 studies with 7732 participants provided data for analyses. Follow‐up of trial participants ranged from 1 month to 28 months (2 months to 28 months for trials that reported clinical outcomes). The Review shows the following.‐ The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about effects of interventions on all clinical outcomes.‐ Well‐designed trials that collect data over longer follow‐up times are needed in the future to find out the best nutritional supplementation (if any) for people with NAFLD. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Study on Nutritional Supplements for People with Fatty Liver Disease Not Caused by Alcohol

## Plain Title
Do Nutritional Supplements Help People with Fatty Liver Disease Not Caused by Alcohol?

## Rationale

### What is fatty liver disease?
Some people get fat buildup in their liver. This happens even when they do not drink much alcohol. Doctors call this non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease, or NAFLD.

### Why does this matter?
The fat in the liver can cause damage over time. The liver can become swollen and sore. This is called inflammation. The liver can also get scars. Doctors call this cirrhosis. These problems can make people very sick.

### Why did researchers do this study?
Doctors have tried many treatments for NAFLD. But so far, no treatment clearly works. Some people think vitamins and other nutritional supplements might help. These supplements might reduce liver damage. But no one knows for sure if they work.

### What did researchers want to find out?
Researchers wanted to know if nutritional supplements help people with NAFLD. They looked at whether supplements help people live longer. They checked if supplements improve how people feel. They also looked at whether supplements prevent serious liver problems. Finally, they wanted to know if supplements cause any harm.

## Trial Design

### How did researchers study this?
Researchers looked at 202 studies done by other scientists. These studies tested different nutritional supplements. The studies included 14,200 people total.

### Who was in these studies?
The studies included people of any age or gender. They came from different backgrounds. All had fatty liver disease not caused by alcohol. When studies reported ages, people ranged from 7 to 61 years old. People who had liver transplants before were not included.

### What supplements did people take?
People in the studies took different vitamins and nutritional supplements. Each study tested different types.

### How long did the studies last?
Most studies lasted between 1 month and 28 months. Studies that looked at serious health problems lasted 2 months to 28 months.

### How did researchers compare treatments?
Researchers used special methods to compare all the treatments. They could compare two treatments at once. They also used advanced methods to compare many treatments at the same time.

## Results

### What did researchers find?
Only 19 studies out of 202 were done very carefully. This means we cannot be very sure about the results. The findings show:

- Deaths were very rare during these studies
- Serious liver problems were very rare
- Liver cancer was very rare
- Need for liver transplant was very rare
- These rare events happened even without any treatment

### Did any supplements help?
The evidence does not show that any nutritional supplement helped. We cannot say for sure if supplements prevent death or serious liver problems. We also cannot say if they improve how people feel.

### Why were serious problems so rare?
The studies did not last long enough. Most studies only followed people for a few months. But liver damage from NAFLD takes 8 to 28 years to cause serious problems. Studies need to last 5 to 10 years to see real differences.

### What does this mean?
We still do not know if nutritional supplements help people with NAFLD. The studies were too short. They did not follow people long enough to see if supplements prevent serious problems.

### What is needed next?
We need better studies in the future. These studies should:
- Follow people for many years
- Be done very carefully
- Collect information about serious health problems

Only then will we know if any nutritional supplement truly helps people with NAFLD."
10.1002-14651858.CD013162.pub2-pls.txt,"Cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety in children and young people
Why is this review important? 
Many children and young people experience problems with anxiety. Children and young people with anxiety disorders are more likely than their peers to have difficulty with friendships, family life, and school, and to develop mental health problems later in life. Therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can help children and young people to overcome difficulties with anxiety by using new ways of thinking and facing their fears. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
Parents, children, and young people; people working in education and mental health services for children and young people; and general practitioners. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
This review updates and replaces previous Cochrane Reviews from 2005 and 2015, which showed that CBT is an effective treatment for children and young people with anxiety disorders. 
This review aimed to answer the following questions:
• Is CBT more effective than a waiting list or no treatment?
• Is CBT more effective than other treatments and medication?
• Does CBT help to reduce anxiety for children and young people in the longer term?
• Are some types of CBT more effective than others? (e.g. individual versus group therapy) 
• Is CBT effective for specific groups? (e.g. children with autism)
Which studies were included in the review? 
We searched the databases to find all studies of CBT for anxiety disorders in children and young people published up to October 2019. In order to be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) and had to include young people under 19 years of age with an anxiety disorder diagnosis. We included 87 studies with a total of 5964 participants in the analysis. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
We rated the overall quality of the evidence as 'moderate’ or 'low'. There is evidence that CBT is more effective than a waiting list or no treatment in reducing anxiety in children and young people, although the findings did vary across studies. There is no clear evidence that CBT is more effective than other treatments. A small number of studies looked at outcomes six months after CBT was given and showed that reductions in anxiety continued. We found no clear evidence that one way of providing CBT is more effective than another (e.g. in a group, longer treatments, with parents) or that CBT is more or less effective for any specific group of children (e.g. children with autism spectrum disorders). 
What should happen next? 
Future research should compare CBT to alternative treatments and medication; identify who does and does not benefit from CBT and what those who do not benefit need; establish how to make CBT more accessible; and give far more consideration to neglected populations, including children and young people from low‐ and middle‐income countries. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Anxiety in Children and Young People

## Plain Title
Does Talk Therapy Help Reduce Anxiety in Children and Teens?

## Rationale

### What is the problem?
Many children and teens feel very anxious. Anxiety means feeling worried, scared, or nervous a lot of the time. When young people have too much anxiety, it can make life hard. They may struggle to make friends. They may have trouble at home with family. School can feel very difficult. These children are also more likely to have mental health problems when they grow up.

### What might help?
One treatment that might help is called cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT. CBT is a type of talk therapy. It teaches children new ways to think about things that worry them. It also helps them face their fears in a safe way. Over time, this can make anxiety less strong.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors and parents need to know if CBT really works. They want to know if it works better than other treatments. They also want to know if it keeps working after treatment ends. This review looked at many studies to answer these questions. It updates earlier reviews from 2005 and 2015.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was not one single study. Instead, researchers looked at 87 different studies. All these studies tested CBT in children and teens with anxiety. The studies included 5,964 young people in total.

### Who was in these studies?
The studies included children and young people under 19 years old. All of them had been told by a doctor that they had an anxiety disorder. This means their anxiety was serious enough to need treatment.

### What type of studies were included?
All studies were randomized controlled trials. This means each young person was put into a treatment group by chance. Some got CBT right away. Others were put on a waiting list or got a different treatment. This helps researchers know if CBT really works.

### What did researchers want to find out?
They wanted to know several things:
- Does CBT work better than no treatment?
- Does CBT work better than other treatments or medicine?
- Does CBT keep working months after it ends?
- Do some types of CBT work better than others?
- Does CBT work for all children or just some groups?

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
The researchers found that CBT does help reduce anxiety in children and teens. It works better than being on a waiting list or getting no treatment at all. However, the results were different across different studies.

The quality of the evidence was rated as moderate or low. This means we can be somewhat confident in the results. But more research would help us be more sure.

### Does CBT work better than other treatments?
The studies did not show clear proof that CBT works better than other treatments. This means CBT may work about the same as other therapies.

### Does CBT keep working over time?
A few studies checked on children six months after treatment ended. These studies showed that anxiety stayed lower. This is good news. It means the benefits of CBT may last.

### Does one type of CBT work better?
Researchers looked at different ways to give CBT. Some children got CBT alone. Others got CBT in a group. Some treatments were longer. Some included parents. The studies did not show that one way works better than another.

### Does CBT work for all children?
The researchers looked at different groups of children. This included children with autism. They did not find clear proof that CBT works better or worse for any specific group.

### What should happen next?
More research is needed. Future studies should compare CBT to other treatments and medicines. They should find out which children benefit most from CBT. They should also find out what helps children who do not get better with CBT. Researchers need to study children from poorer countries. Very few studies have been done in these places.

### What does this mean?
CBT appears to be a helpful treatment for anxiety in children and young people. It can reduce worry and fear. The benefits may last over time. Parents and doctors can feel somewhat confident using CBT to help anxious children."
10.1002-14651858.CD013163.pub2-pls.txt,"Systematic review of lipid emulsions for intravenous nutrition in preterm infants.
Review question: which lipid (fat) emulsions (LE) have the best outcomes in preterm infants with and without liver disease and surgical conditions? 
Background: preterm infants who need nutrition (feeding) through intravenous (into a vein; called parenteral nutrition) lines have been conventionally given pure soybean oil‐based fat emulsions. However, high polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content and phytosterols in pure soybean oil‐based emulsions may be harmful and contribute to parenteral nutrition‐associated liver disease (PNALD). The newer lipid emulsions (LE) from alternative lipid sources, including fish oil, may potentially improve clinical outcomes in preterm infants by decreasing PUFA content and providing lipid source‐specific benefits. 
Study characteristics: we searched the medical literature and identified 29 studies (including 2037 preterm infants). The evidence is up to date as of 18 June 2018. 
Key findings: in the population of preterm infants, without liver disease or surgical conditions, no particular LE was better than another for growth, liver disease, death, retinopathy (eye disease), infection and chronic lung disease. 
While there was very low quality and limited evidence to suggest that fish oil‐based LE may improve liver disease‐related outcomes in infants with pre‐existing liver disease, this evidence was based on a limited number of infants from two small studies, one of which was terminated early, and no certain conclusions can be drawn. 
Conclusions: based on this review, no particular LE is better than another for intravenous nutrition in preterm infants. There currently exists insufficient evidence from well‐designed studies about the benefit of fish oil‐LE for improving liver disease‐related outcomes in infants with pre‐existing liver disease or surgical conditions. Further research is required to establish the role of fish oil‐LE for liver disease outcomes in preterm infants and the ideal composition of LE for preterm infants. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Types of Fat Solutions Given Through a Vein to Premature Babies

## Rationale

### What is the health condition?
Some babies are born too early (premature). These babies often cannot eat food by mouth right away. They need to get food through a tube that goes into a vein. This is called IV feeding.

### What causes problems?
Doctors give these babies a mix of nutrients through the vein. This mix includes fats. For many years, doctors used fat made from soybean oil. But this type of fat may harm the liver. It has substances called PUFA and phytosterols that might cause liver disease in these tiny babies.

### Why was this study needed?
Newer types of fat solutions are now available. Some are made from fish oil or other sources. These newer fats might be safer for the baby's liver. They have less of the harmful substances found in soybean oil.

### What did researchers want to learn?
Researchers wanted to know which type of fat solution works best for premature babies. They looked at babies with healthy livers and babies who already had liver problems. They wanted to see if any fat type helped babies grow better or stay healthier.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was not a single study. Instead, researchers looked at many studies done by other doctors. They searched medical records and found 29 different studies. These studies included 2,037 premature babies in total.

### Who was in the studies?
All babies in these studies were born too early. Some babies had healthy livers. Other babies already had liver disease or needed surgery.

### What did researchers look at?
The researchers compared different types of fat solutions. They looked at:
- Pure soybean oil fat
- Fish oil fat
- Other mixed fat solutions

They checked how well babies grew. They looked for liver problems, eye disease, lung disease, and infections. They also tracked how many babies died.

### When was this done?
The researchers found all studies published up to June 18, 2018.

## Results

### What did the study find for healthy babies?
For premature babies without liver disease, no fat type was clearly better than others. All fat types seemed to work about the same for:
- How well babies grew
- Liver health
- Survival rates
- Eye problems
- Infections
- Lung disease

### What about babies with liver disease?
Some evidence suggested fish oil fat might help babies who already had liver disease. But this evidence was very weak. Only two small studies looked at this question. One study stopped early before finishing. The number of babies studied was too small to be sure.

### What do the results mean?
Based on all the studies reviewed, doctors cannot say one fat type is better than another. More research is needed.

### What are the main conclusions?
The researchers concluded that:
- No single fat solution is clearly best for premature babies getting IV feeding
- There is not enough good evidence about fish oil helping babies with liver disease
- More studies are needed to find the best fat solution for these tiny babies
- Scientists need to figure out the ideal mix of fats for premature babies

### Why does this matter?

What is the issue? 
High levels of potassium (a body salt) can build up with chronic kidney disease. This can lead to changes in muscle function including the heart muscle, and cause problems with heart rhythms that can be dangerous. Dialysis can remove potassium from the blood, but for some patients levels can still be high. Patients with severe kidney failure who have not yet started dialysis may have high potassium levels. Treatments have been available for many years but can cause constipation and abdominal discomfort, which make them intolerable for many patients. Newer treatments have been developed including patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. These may be more tolerable but it is uncertain whether they help to prevent heart complications. 
What did we do? 
We searched for all the research trials that have assessed the potassium‐lowering treatments for children and adults with chronic kidney diseases. We evaluated how certain we could be about the overall findings using a system called ""GRADE"". 
What did we find? 
There are 15 studies involving 1849 randomised adults. Patients in the studies were given a potassium binder or a dummy pill (placebo) or standard care. The treatment they got was decided by random chance. The studies were generally short‐term over days to weeks and focused on potassium levels. Heart related complications could not be measured in this short time frame. Based on the existing research, we can't be sure whether potassium binders improve well‐being or prevent complications in people with chronic kidney disease. There were no studies in children. 
Conclusions 
We can't be certain about the best treatments to reduce body potassium levels for people with chronic kidney disease. We need more information from clinical studies that involve a larger number of patients who have the treatment over several months or years.

## Plain Title
Do Medicines That Lower Potassium Levels Help People with Long-Term Kidney Disease?

## Rationale

### What is the problem?
When kidneys do not work well over a long time, this is called chronic kidney disease. The kidneys cannot remove waste from the body as they should. One waste product is potassium, which is a type of salt in the body.

When potassium builds up too much in the blood, it can cause serious problems. High potassium can change how muscles work. This includes the heart muscle. It can cause the heart to beat in wrong patterns. These heart rhythm problems can be very dangerous.

### What treatments are available?
Some people get dialysis treatment. Dialysis is a machine that cleans the blood. It can remove extra potassium. But even with dialysis, some people still have too much potassium. Other people have very bad kidney disease but have not started dialysis yet. They may also have high potassium levels.

Doctors have used medicines for many years to lower potassium. These medicines are called potassium binders. They work by attaching to potassium in the gut. This stops the body from taking in potassium. But these older medicines often cause problems. Many people get constipation or stomach pain. These side effects make people stop taking the medicine.

### Why was this study needed?
Drug companies have made newer potassium binders. Two newer ones are called patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. These newer medicines may be easier for people to take. They may cause fewer stomach problems. But doctors do not know if these medicines actually prevent heart problems. They do not know if the medicines help people feel better or live longer.

Researchers wanted to look at all the studies done on potassium binders. They wanted to see if these medicines really help people with kidney disease.

## Trial Design

### How did researchers study this?
Researchers looked for all studies that tested potassium binders. They searched for studies in both children and adults with chronic kidney disease.

They found 15 studies. These studies included 1,849 adults total. The studies did not include any children.

In these studies, people were split into groups by chance. Some people got a potassium binder medicine. Other people got a fake pill with no medicine in it. This fake pill is called a placebo. Some people got standard care with no special treatment.

### What were the limits of these studies?
Most studies were very short. They lasted only days or weeks. The studies mainly measured potassium levels in the blood. They did not run long enough to see if people had fewer heart problems. Heart problems take months or years to develop.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
The researchers could not be sure if potassium binders really help people. The studies were too short. They did not measure the most important things.

The researchers used a system called GRADE to check how reliable the findings were. Based on this system, they found the evidence was not strong enough.

### What does this mean?
Doctors cannot be certain which treatments work best to lower potassium in people with kidney disease. The current studies do not show if these medicines help people feel better. They do not show if the medicines prevent heart problems or help people live longer.

### What is needed next?
More research studies are needed. These studies should include more people. The studies should last longer—for months or years, not just weeks. Longer studies would show if potassium binders prevent heart problems and help people live better lives.

Studies are also needed in children with kidney disease. Right now, there is no research on how these medicines work in children."
10.1002-14651858.CD013168.pub2-pls.txt,"Internal iliac artery revascularisation versus internal iliac artery occlusion for endovascular treatment of aorto‐iliac aneurysms 
Background 
An aorto‐iliac aneurysm is a dilatation (aneurysm) of the aorta, the main large blood vessel in the body, which carries blood out from the heart to all organs and iliac arteries (distal branches of the aorta). The aneurysm can grow and burst (rupture), which leads to severe bleeding and is frequently fatal; an estimated 15,000 deaths occur each year from ruptured aortic abdominal aneurysms in the USA alone. To avoid this complication, the aorto‐iliac aneurysm should be repaired when the maximum diameter of the aorta reaches 5 cm to 5.5 cm, or when the maximum diameter of the common iliac arteries reaches 3 cm to 4 cm. 
Endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms is one approach that is used to manage this condition: a tube (stent‐graft) is placed inside the aorto‐iliac aneurysm, so that blood flows through the stent‐graft and no longer into the aneurysm, excluding it from the circulation. To achieve a successful deployment of the stent‐graft, a good seal zone (fixation zone) is needed in the aorta (proximal) and in the common iliac arteries (distal). However, in 40% of patients, the distal seal zone in the common iliac arteries is inadequate. In these cases, most commonly the stent‐graft is extended to the external iliac artery and the internal iliac artery is blocked (occluded). However, this obstruction (occlusion) is not without harms: the internal iliac artery supplies blood to the pelvic organs (rectum, bladder, and reproductive organs) and the pelvic muscles, and occlusion is associated with complications in the pelvic area such as buttock claudication (cramping pain in the buttock during exercise), sexual dysfunction, and spinal cord injury. 
New endovascular devices and techniques such as iliac branch devices have emerged to maintain blood flow into the internal iliac artery. These special stent‐grafts position the distal seal zone within the external iliac artery, and a side branch of the graft allows for revascularisation of the internal iliac artery, while excluding the aneurysm from the circulation, promoting an adequate distal seal zone, and maintaining pelvic circulation. This may also preserve the quality of life of treated individuals and may reduce serious complications including spinal cord ischaemia, ischaemic colitis, and gluteal necrosis. 
This review aimed to assess the effects of internal iliac artery revascularisation compared with internal iliac artery occlusion during endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms. 
Study characteristics and key results 
We searched for evidence that directly compared internal iliac artery revascularisation versus internal iliac artery occlusion for endovascular treatment of aorto‐iliac aneurysms. Our searches up to 28 August 2019 did not identify any randomised controlled trials (clinical studies in which people are randomly (by chance alone) put into one of several intervention groups) that met our criteria. Studies are needed to help vascular and endovascular surgeons choose the best option for endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms and isolated iliac aneurysms with an inadequate distal fixation zone. 
Conclusion 
We found no RCTs that compared internal iliac artery revascularisation versus internal iliac artery occlusion for endovascular treatment of aorto‐iliac aneurysms. High‐quality studies that evaluate the best strategy for managing the endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms with inadequate distal seal zones in the common iliac artery are needed.

## Plain Title
Comparing Two Ways to Treat Bulging Blood Vessels in the Belly and Pelvis Area

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

The aorta is the main blood vessel in your body. It carries blood from your heart to all your organs. Sometimes, the aorta and nearby vessels called iliac arteries can bulge out like a balloon. Doctors call this bulge an aneurysm.

An aneurysm can grow bigger over time. If it bursts, it causes severe bleeding inside the body. This is often deadly. In the USA alone, about 15,000 people die each year from burst aneurysms in the belly area.

**When does treatment happen?**

Doctors repair the aneurysm before it bursts. They do this when the aorta grows to 5 to 5.5 cm wide. They also repair it when the iliac arteries grow to 3 to 4 cm wide.

**How do doctors fix this problem?**

One way to fix it uses a special tube called a stent-graft. Doctors place this tube inside the bulging blood vessel. Blood then flows through the tube instead of into the bulge. This protects the weak area from bursting.

**What is the challenge?**

The tube needs to attach firmly at both ends. In 4 out of 10 patients, there is not enough good space to attach the tube at the lower end. When this happens, doctors usually extend the tube further down. They block off a branch vessel called the internal iliac artery.

**Why is blocking this artery a problem?**

The internal iliac artery brings blood to organs in the pelvis area. These include the bladder, bowel, and sex organs. It also supplies blood to muscles in the buttocks. Blocking this artery can cause problems like:
- Pain in the buttocks when walking
- Sexual problems
- Damage to the spinal cord
- Other serious complications

**What is the new approach?**

New devices have special side branches. These allow doctors to keep blood flowing to the internal iliac artery. They can still fix the aneurysm while keeping the pelvic area healthy.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to find out which approach works better. They looked for studies comparing keeping the internal iliac artery open versus blocking it off.

## Trial Design

**What did the researchers look for?**

The researchers searched for clinical studies up to August 28, 2019. They wanted to find studies where patients were put into groups by chance. One group would have their internal iliac artery kept open. The other group would have it blocked off.

**What type of studies did they want?**

They looked for randomized controlled trials. In these studies, chance alone decides which treatment each person gets. This type of study gives the most reliable results.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found no studies that met their requirements. They could not find any randomized controlled trials comparing these two approaches.

**What does this mean?**

Without good quality studies, doctors cannot be sure which approach is better. More research is needed to help doctors choose the best way to treat these aneurysms.

**Why is this important?**

Surgeons need good evidence to make the best choices for their patients. This is especially true when the blood vessel does not have enough good space for attaching the tube.

**What happens next?**

High-quality studies are needed. These studies should compare keeping the internal iliac artery open versus blocking it. They should look at which approach:
- Works better at fixing the aneurysm
- Causes fewer problems
- Helps patients maintain their quality of life

Until these studies are done, doctors must make decisions based on other types of evidence and their experience."
10.1002-14651858.CD013170.pub2-pls.txt,"The safety and effectiveness of techniques to assist coughing in people with chronic neuromuscular disorders 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of techniques used to assist coughing in people with chronic neuromuscular disorders (cough augmentation techniques). 
Background 
People with neuromuscular disorders (nerve‐related conditions that affect the muscles) may have difficulty coughing and clearing mucous from the airways, placing them at risk of choking, recurrent chest infections, and ongoing lung disease. Cough augmentation techniques, such as manually assisted cough, bagging (using a self‐inflating bag commonly used for resuscitation), mechanical Cough Assist (a device that clears secretions by applying a positive pressure to the airway, then rapidly shifting to a negative pressure), 'frog' breathing (a method of breathing to help a person take in a bigger volume of air), and breathstacking (the person takes a number of sequential breaths in, stacking one breath on top of the other without breathing out in between breaths) aim to improve cough effectiveness, with the eventual aim of reducing the number or severity (or both) of chest infections, and improving the ability of people to perform daily activities (functional ability) and quality of life. 
Methods 
We carried out a wide database search for studies of cough augmentation techniques in adults and children with chronic neuromuscular disorders. We selected studies that assigned people to the treatment(s) or treatment order by chance, as this study type provides the best evidence. 
Results and quality of the evidence 
We found 11 studies with 287 people and several cough augmentation techniques. One study measured the long‐term effects of treatment, but was only published as an abstract without enough information to accurately analyse the study findings. Many included studies had problems with how they were performed, how their findings were reported, or both, which made it difficult to fully interpret their results. None of the studies reported on the outcomes we thought were the most important for making decisions about the effectiveness and safety of cough augmentation techniques. For example, the studies did not report on the number or duration of unscheduled hospital admissions for chest infections, survival, functional ability, or quality of life. The safety of cough augmentation techniques could not be determined. Some studies suggested that cough augmentation techniques may be better than an unassisted cough, but the results are very uncertain. There was not enough evidence to show that any one technique was better than another in improving cough effort. 
Conclusions and recommendation 
The findings of this review provided insufficient information to make decisions about when and how to use cough augmentation techniques in people with chronic neuromuscular disorders. There is currently very low certainty evidence for or against the safety and effectiveness of cough augmentation techniques in people with chronic neuromuscular diseases and more studies are needed. 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to 13 April 2020.
","# Plain Language Summary: Techniques to Help People Cough When They Have Muscle and Nerve Diseases

## Plain Title
Do Cough-Assist Techniques Help People with Long-Term Muscle and Nerve Diseases?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some people have diseases that affect their nerves and muscles. These diseases last a long time. They make the muscles weak. When muscles are weak, it is hard to cough well. A strong cough helps clear mucus from the lungs. Mucus is the sticky fluid in your airways.

**Why is this a problem?**

When people cannot cough well, mucus stays in their lungs. This can cause serious problems. People may choke. They may get lung infections over and over. Their lungs can become damaged over time. This makes daily life very hard.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know if special cough-assist techniques could help. These techniques help people cough better. They include:
- Manual help: Someone pushes on the chest or belly
- Bagging: Using a special bag that pushes air into the lungs
- Cough Assist machine: A device that pushes air in, then quickly pulls air out
- Frog breathing: A way to breathe in more air at once
- Breath stacking: Taking many breaths in a row without breathing out

**Why do this study?**

Researchers hoped these techniques would help people cough better. Better coughing might mean fewer lung infections. It might help people feel better and do more activities. It might improve their quality of life.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked for other studies already done. They searched many medical databases. They looked for studies that tested cough-assist techniques.

**What kind of studies did they include?**

They only included studies that assigned people to treatments by chance. This is the best way to test if something works. They looked for studies in both adults and children. All people in the studies had long-term muscle and nerve diseases.

**How many studies did they find?**

They found 11 studies. These studies included 287 people total. The studies tested different cough-assist techniques. One study looked at long-term effects. But that study did not have enough details to use.

**How long were the studies?**

Most studies were short. Only one study looked at long-term effects. The review included studies published up to April 2020.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers could not find clear answers. The studies had many problems. Some studies were not done well. Some did not report their findings clearly. This made it hard to understand the results.

**What important information was missing?**

The studies did not measure the most important things. They did not report:
- How many people went to the hospital for lung infections
- How long people stayed in the hospital
- Whether people lived longer
- Whether people could do daily activities better
- Whether quality of life improved

**Were the techniques safe?**

The researchers could not tell if the techniques were safe. The studies did not give enough information about safety.

**Did the techniques help?**

Some studies suggested the techniques might help more than no help at all. But the results were very uncertain. The researchers could not be sure. They could not tell if one technique worked better than another.

**How certain are these findings?**

The certainty of the evidence was very low. This means we cannot trust the findings very much. More and better studies are needed.

**What do the researchers conclude?**

There is not enough good information to make decisions. Doctors and patients cannot know when to use these techniques. They cannot know which technique to use. They cannot know if the techniques are safe.

**What is needed next?**

More studies are needed. These studies should be done better. They should measure the things that matter most to patients. They should follow people for a longer time. They should clearly report safety information.

**What does this mean for patients?**

Right now, there is not enough proof that cough-assist techniques help. There is also not enough proof that they are safe. Patients and doctors must make decisions without clear evidence. More research will help provide better answers in the future."
10.1002-14651858.CD013172.pub2-pls.txt,"How accurate is duplex ultrasound (DUS) imaging for diagnosing carotid artery stenosis in symptomatic patients? 
Carotid artery stenosis (CAS) is a narrowing of the lumen (the inside space) of the carotid artery (usually due to cholesterol deposits called plaque). CAS is responsible for 8% of all strokes due to a blocked blood vessel (ischemic strokes) and is associated with a high chance of recurrence. In such circumstances, the treatment is to re‐establish adequate blood flow (by surgery or other approaches to open the artery) to prevent further neurologic episodes. Duplex ultrasound (DUS) can help identify the appropriate patients who will benefit from a more invasive treatment and those who should be with drugs alone. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To determine how accurate DUS is for diagnosing different grades of CAS in individuals with neurologic symptoms. 
What was studied in the review? 
DUS is used in clinical practice as the first test to detect carotid artery stenosis, usually with the result confirmed by other more expensive and invasive tests, such as computed tomography angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), or digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The advantage of DUS is that it is less expensive and helps to reduce the time required to select patients for treatment. We included studies assessing the accuracy of DUS compared with DSA, MRA, or CTA in patients with recent stroke symptoms. We grouped the results from studies that used approximately the same method and threshold to assess accuracy in the following categories of carotid artery stenosis: < 50%, 50% to 99%, 50% to 69%, 70% to 99%, and occlusion (blockage of the vessel). 
What are the main results of this review? 
This review included 22 studies (4957 carotid arteries tested). The searches were performed up to 15 February 2021. The results indicate the following: If DUS were to be used in a standardized cohort of 1000 patients: 
For DUS versus DSA  
< 50% CAS (4 studies, 1495 carotid arteries): Estimated 299 patients would have a DUS result indicating the presence of non‐significant CAS, of whom eight (2.7%) would be incorrectly classified. Of the 701 people with a result indicating that < 50% carotid stenosis is not present, 169 (24.1%) would be incorrectly classified. 
50% to 99% CAS (5 studies, 1536 carotid arteries): Estimated 642 patients would have a DUS result indicating the presence of 50% to 99% CAS; of these, 147 (22.8%) would be incorrectly classified. Of the 358 people with a result indicating that 50% to 99% carotid stenosis is not present, 15 (4.2%) would be incorrectly classified. 
70% to 99% CAS (9 studies, 2770 carotid arteries): Estimated 390 patients would have a DUS result indicating the presence of 70% to 99% CAS; of these, eight (2%) would be incorrectly classified. Of the 610 people with a result indicating that 70% to 99% carotid stenosis is not present, 68 (11.1%) would be incorrectly classified. 
Occlusion (7 studies, 1212 carotid arteries): Estimated 205 patients would have a DUS result indicating carotid artery occlusion; of these, 41 (20%) would be incorrectly classified. Of the 795 people with a result indicating that carotid occlusion is not present, 16 (2%) would be incorrectly classified. 
For DUS versus CTA  
Occlusion (3 studies, 833 carotid arteries): An estimated 606 patients would have a DUS result indicating carotid artery occlusion; of these, 36 (6%) would be incorrectly classified. 394 people with a result indicating that carotid occlusion is not present, 30 (8%) would be incorrectly classified. 
For DUS versus MRA  
Meta‐analysis was not performed.
How reliable are the results of the studies in this review? 
There were some problems with how the studies were conducted that could impair the correct estimates of the diagnostic accuracy. Many of the studies were of poor or unclear quality. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
The results are relevant for patients with neurologic symptoms who are suspected of having carotid artery stenosis. 
What are the implications of this review? 
The diagnostic accuracy of DUS is high, especially at discriminating between the presence or absence of significant carotid artery stenosis. This evidence, plus its less invasive nature, supports the early use of DUS for the detection of carotid artery stenosis.

## Plain Title
How Well Does Ultrasound Work to Find Blocked Neck Arteries in People with Stroke Symptoms?

## Rationale

### What is the health problem?
The carotid arteries are large blood vessels in your neck. They carry blood to your brain. Sometimes, these arteries get narrow because fatty deposits called plaque build up inside them. This is called carotid artery stenosis.

When these arteries get too narrow, blood cannot flow well to the brain. This can cause a stroke. About 8 out of every 100 strokes happen because of blocked carotid arteries. People who have one stroke from this problem often have another stroke later.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors need to find out which patients have narrow carotid arteries. Some patients need surgery or other treatments to open the artery. Other patients only need medicine. 

Duplex ultrasound (DUS) is a test that uses sound waves to look at blood flow. It does not hurt and costs less than other tests. Doctors often use DUS first to check the carotid arteries.

### What did researchers want to learn?
Researchers wanted to know how good DUS is at finding narrow carotid arteries. They wanted to see if DUS could correctly tell doctors how narrow the arteries are. This would help doctors choose the right treatment for each patient.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was a review study. Researchers looked at 22 other studies that had already been done. They combined the results from all these studies.

### Who was in the studies?
The studies included 4,957 carotid arteries from patients who had recent stroke symptoms. These patients needed testing to see if their carotid arteries were blocked.

### What did researchers compare?
Researchers compared DUS results to other tests. These other tests included:
- DSA (a test using X-rays and dye)
- CTA (a CT scan with dye)
- MRA (an MRI scan)

These other tests are more expensive. Some require needles or dye injections. Doctors often use them to confirm DUS results.

### When was this study done?
Researchers looked at studies published up to February 15, 2021.

## Results

### What did the study find?
The researchers looked at how well DUS found different levels of narrowing. They tested DUS on 1,000 pretend patients to show how it would work.

**For arteries less than 50% blocked:**
- DUS said 299 patients had some narrowing
- Only 8 of these 299 were wrong
- DUS said 701 patients did not have this level of narrowing
- But 169 of these 701 were actually wrong

**For arteries 50% to 99% blocked:**
- DUS said 642 patients had this level of narrowing
- But 147 of these 642 were wrong
- DUS said 358 patients did not have this level of narrowing
- Only 15 of these 358 were wrong

**For arteries 70% to 99% blocked:**
- DUS said 390 patients had this level of narrowing
- Only 8 of these 390 were wrong
- DUS said 610 patients did not have this level of narrowing
- But 68 of these 610 were wrong

**For completely blocked arteries:**
- DUS said 205 patients had complete blockage
- But 41 of these 205 were wrong
- DUS said 795 patients did not have complete blockage
- Only 16 of these 795 were wrong

### What do these results mean?
DUS works very well at finding serious narrowing in carotid arteries. It is especially good at telling which patients have dangerous blockages. These patients may need surgery or other treatments.

DUS is less invasive than other tests. It does not use needles or radiation. It costs less money. Because it works well, doctors can use DUS as the first test.

### What were the problems with the studies?
Some studies were not done very carefully. This means the results might not be completely accurate. More high-quality studies are needed.

### What is the main conclusion?
DUS is a good test for finding blocked carotid arteries in people with stroke symptoms. Doctors can trust DUS results when deciding which patients need treatment. Using DUS first can help patients get the right care faster."
10.1002-14651858.CD013173.pub2-pls.txt,"Behavioural and cognitive behavioural therapy for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) 
Aim of the review 
The aim of the review is to see if cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can help people who have OCD who also have ASD. 
Background 
People who have been given a diagnosis of ASD tend to have certain things in common. They often understand social interactions and communication differently to other people. People with ASD may also be less flexible in their thinking than other people, which may make it more difficult for them to use psychological therapies in the way that they are usually presented. The opinions of people with ASD are valuable in helping clinicians decide which research areas related to ASD should take priority. 
Someone who has been diagnosed with OCD has certain symptoms which, to some extent, affect how they are able to get on with their lives. Someone with OCD has persistent thoughts, although they don't want the thoughts and often think that the thoughts are unreasonable. These thoughts are often worries about themselves or someone else being harmed or about something not being perfect or just right. Sometimes the person with OCD feels as if they have to think thoughts or do actions repeatedly to 'make things right', even though they often really know that they don't need to. The repeated actions might be something like washing their hands. 
Research has shown that people with ASD are more likely to develop OCD. People may have certain genes that make them more likely to develop both ASD and OCD, or it may be that the way people with ASD tend to think makes them more likely to have OCD. 
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been used for a long time to treat OCD. CBT is usually carried out by visiting a therapist, but it can be delivered in different ways, such as online. CBT involves talking about the repeated thoughts that occur and helping the person manage and reduce them, and also involves trying to carry out compulsive actions less often. Because people with ASD sometimes have a different way of thinking and communicating, clinicians have wondered if CBT would be as useful to treat OCD in people with ASD as it is in people who have OCD but don't have ASD. Other researchers have devised ways to change the way that CBT is delivered to people with ASD to help them to get the most out of the treatment, and this is called 'adapted CBT'. Studies have shown that adapted CBT is useful for some anxiety disorders that occur in ASD. However, not as many studies have looked at how adapted CBT might be useful for OCD in people with ASD. 
Search 
We searched for randomised controlled trials of delivery of CBT to people with OCD who also had ASD. A randomised controlled trial is a trial where the participants are randomly allocated to CBT or another treatment group so that the people running the trial have no say about and do not know to which group the participants belong. The other treatment group is called the control group. In these studies, the people in the control group do not receive CBT, but they may have sessions with their therapists that do not include CBT, or they may be on a waiting list. If meeting with your therapist or waiting for time to pass were just as helpful as CBT, for example, then the results would be less likely to show a difference between the outcomes of the treatment group and the control group. Conversely, if CBT was more effective, then we might expect to see the CBT group doing better than the control group. Therefore, at the end of each trial, when the results in the treatment group are compared to the results in the control group, it gives information about how effective CBT might be for people with OCD and ASD. The evidence in this review is current to August 2020. 
Conclusion 
We found that there was only one published randomised controlled trial of delivery of CBT to people with OCD and ASD that met our search criteria. The control group in this trial was given a treatment called 'anxiety management' which helped the participants to manage anxiety but did not help them to deal specifically with repeated thoughts and actions, as CBT does. This study aimed to see if either anxiety management or CBT was better at treating OCD in people with ASD, but the study did not find a difference in response between the two treatments.

Can Talk Therapy Help People Who Have Both Autism and OCD?

## Rationale

**What are these conditions?**

Some people have autism (also called ASD). People with autism often think and talk in ways that are different from other people. They may find it harder to change how they do things.

Some people have OCD. People with OCD have thoughts they don't want. These thoughts come back again and again. The thoughts often worry about harm or things not being perfect. People with OCD may feel they must do the same actions over and over. For example, they may wash their hands many times. They know they don't need to, but they feel they must. These thoughts and actions make daily life harder.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

People with autism are more likely to get OCD. This may be because of their genes. Or it may be because of how they think.

Doctors use a treatment called CBT to help people with OCD. CBT stands for cognitive behavioral therapy. It is a type of talk therapy. In CBT, people talk with a therapist about their repeated thoughts. The therapist helps them manage these thoughts. People also learn to do their repeated actions less often.

Doctors wondered if CBT works as well for people who have both autism and OCD. Some doctors changed how they give CBT to people with autism. This is called ""adapted CBT."" Adapted CBT helps with some types of worry in people with autism. But researchers needed to learn if it helps with OCD too.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to see if CBT can help people who have both OCD and autism.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this?**

Researchers looked for studies that tested CBT in people with both OCD and autism. They wanted a special type of study. In this type of study, people are put into groups by chance. One group gets CBT. The other group does not get CBT. This other group is called the control group.

The control group might get other help. Or they might wait for treatment. At the end, researchers compare the two groups. This shows if CBT works better than the other option.

Researchers searched for these studies up to August 2020.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included people who had both OCD and autism.

## Results

**What did researchers find?**

Researchers found only one study that fit what they were looking for.

In this study, one group got CBT. The other group got ""anxiety management."" Anxiety management helps people feel less worried. But it does not help with the repeated thoughts and actions like CBT does.

The study tried to see if CBT or anxiety management worked better. The study did not find a difference between the two treatments.

**What does this mean?**

Right now, there is not enough research to know if CBT helps people who have both OCD and autism. Only one study has been done. That study did not show that CBT worked better than anxiety management.

More studies are needed. These studies should test if CBT helps people with both conditions. They should also test if adapted CBT works better than regular CBT for these people.

**Why is this important?**

Many people have both autism and OCD. Doctors need to know the best way to help them. Right now, they do not have enough information. More research will help doctors give better care to people with both conditions."
10.1002-14651858.CD013180.pub2-pls.txt,"Which is the best treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding?
Key results 
Evidence suggests that the levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine system (LNG‐IUS) is the best first‐line option for reducing menstrual bleeding, while antifibrinolytics are probably the second best, and long‐cycle progestogens are the third best. Because of some limitations in the evidence, we are not sure what the true effect of these first‐line treatments is for the perception of improvement and satisfaction. 
For second‐line treatments, evidence suggests any type of hysterectomy is the best treatment for reducing bleeding, even though this is a major surgery, and resectoscopic endometrial ablation (REA) and non‐resectoscopic endometrial ablation (NREA) are second and third best. We are uncertain of the true effect of the second‐line treatments on amenorrhoea (absence of menstrual blood loss). Evidence suggests that minimally invasive hysterectomy results in a large increase in satisfaction, and NREA increases satisfaction, but we are uncertain of the true effect of the remaining interventions. 
What is heavy menstrual bleeding? 
Heavy menstrual bleeding is defined as excessive menstrual blood loss that interferes with the quality of life of people who menstruate. It is very common and can affect 20% to 50% of people who menstruate during their reproductive years. There are different treatments available, each with their own pros and cons. The best treatment depends on the person's age, whether they have or want to have children, their personal preferences, and their medical history, among other things. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to get an overview of all the published evidence on different treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding. We were most interested in finding out if the treatments were effective for reducing menstrual bleeding and for improving women's satisfaction. We also wanted to know how the treatment affected quality of life, what side effects it caused, and whether women required further treatment. 
What did we do? 
This study is an overview of reviews, which means we looked for published studies that synthesised the results of other studies on different treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding. Then we tried to give a broad overview of all that evidence. We analysed the certainty of the evidence based on factors like study size and methodological rigour. We categorised the treatments based on patient characteristics, including the desire (intention) for future pregnancy, failure of previous treatment or having been referred for surgery. First‐line treatment included medical interventions and second‐line treatment included the LNG‐IUS plus surgical interventions; thus, the LNG‐IUS was included in both first‐ and second‐line treatments. We used network meta‐analysis, a statistical method that compares all the interventions at the same time, to find out which treatments produced the best results for patients. 
What did we find? 
We found nine reviews with 104 studies, involving a total of 11,881 participants. Altogether, the data we analysed came from 85 trials and 9950 participants. The medical interventions included were: non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antifibrinolytics (tranexamic acid), combined oral contraceptives (COC), combined vaginal ring (CVR), long‐cycle and luteal oral progestogens, the LNG‐IUS, ethamsylate and danazol (included only to provide indirect evidence). These were compared to placebo (sham treatment). The surgical interventions included were: open (abdominal), minimally invasive (vaginal or laparoscopic) and unspecified (or surgeon's choice of) route of hysterectomy, REA, NREA and unspecified endometrial ablation (EA). 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in some evidence is moderate, but for most of it, our confidence is low to very low. The main reasons were because the studies were often not blinded, which means the participants knew which treatment they were receiving, and that could have changed their perception; the direct and indirect evidence was not similar enough to compare in the network; and the range of the results was too wide. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The last search for reviews was in July 2021.
","# Plain Language Summary: Finding the Best Treatment for Heavy Periods

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Treatments to Help Women with Heavy Periods

## Rationale

### What is heavy menstrual bleeding?
Heavy periods mean losing too much blood during your monthly cycle. This can make daily life very hard. It affects how you feel and what you can do.

Between 2 and 5 out of every 10 women have heavy periods at some point. This is a common problem. It happens during the years when women can have babies.

### Why was this study needed?
Many different treatments exist for heavy periods. Each treatment has good points and bad points. The best choice depends on several things. These include a woman's age and if she wants to have children. Her personal wishes and health history also matter.

Doctors need to know which treatments work best. This helps them give women the right care. Women need treatments that reduce bleeding and make them feel better.

### What did researchers want to learn?
Researchers wanted to look at all studies about heavy period treatments. They wanted to find out which treatments work best. They looked at how well treatments reduce bleeding. They also checked if women felt happy with their treatment.

Other important questions included quality of life and side effects. They also wanted to know if women needed more treatment later.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was an overview of reviews. Researchers looked at published studies that had already combined results from other studies. They gathered all this information together. This gave them a big picture of all the evidence.

They sorted treatments into two groups. First-line treatments are tried first. These include medicines. Second-line treatments are tried if medicines don't work. These include a special device and surgeries.

### What treatments did they study?
First-line treatments included:
- Pain medicines (NSAIDs)
- Medicines that help blood clot (tranexamic acid)
- Birth control pills
- Birth control vaginal ring
- Hormone pills taken for longer cycles
- A special device placed in the womb (LNG-IUS)

Second-line treatments included:
- Surgery to remove the womb (hysterectomy) done different ways
- Surgery to remove the womb lining (endometrial ablation) done different ways
- The special device (LNG-IUS)

### Who was in the studies?
The researchers found 9 reviews. These included 104 studies. A total of 11,881 women took part. The final analysis used data from 85 trials. This included 9,950 women.

## Results

### What did the study find?

**For first-line treatments:**
The special device placed in the womb (LNG-IUS) works best to reduce bleeding. Medicines that help blood clot work second best. Hormone pills taken for longer cycles work third best.

Researchers are not completely sure about how these treatments affect women's feelings of improvement. They are also not sure about satisfaction levels.

**For second-line treatments:**
Surgery to remove the womb works best to reduce bleeding. This is major surgery. Surgery to remove just the womb lining works second and third best. Different methods exist for this surgery.

Researchers are not sure about the true effects on stopping periods completely. Surgery to remove the womb using small cuts greatly increases satisfaction. One type of womb lining surgery also increases satisfaction. For other treatments, the true effect is unclear.

### What are the limits of this evidence?
The researchers have moderate confidence in some findings. For most findings, their confidence is low or very low.

Several problems existed with the studies. Often, women knew which treatment they got. This could change how they felt about it. Different studies were too different to compare easily. Some results varied too much.

### How current is this information?
Researchers last searched for studies in July 2021.

### What does this mean?
Women with heavy periods have several treatment choices. The special device placed in the womb appears to work best as a first treatment. If that doesn't work, surgery may be needed. Women should talk with their doctor about which treatment is right for them."
10.1002-14651858.CD013181.pub2-pls.txt,"Self‐administered versus provider‐administered medical abortion (review)
Review question 
The aim of this review was to compare whether women taking abortion drugs on their own without healthcare provider supervision can do so as successfully and safely as women who take the drugs in the presence of trained healthcare providers. 
Background 
Medical abortion used to end pregnancies has been successful and safe when women have access to appropriate information and resources. In provider‐administered medical abortion, drugs are taken in the presence of trained healthcare providers. Access to medical abortion drugs has increased and has given women more control over their abortion procedures through self‐administration. In self‐administered medical abortion, the woman takes the drug(s) without the supervision of a healthcare provider after receiving appropriate information and resources. This is the first review of the published evidence on whether self‐administration of medical abortion is a safe and successful way to end pregnancies. We compared the success and safety of self‐administered medical abortion versus provider‐administered medical abortion. 
Study characteristics 
We included 18 studies (two randomized controlled trials and 16 prospective cohort studies) covering 11,043 women undergoing early medical abortion (up to nine weeks gestation) in 10 countries that compared self‐administered medical abortion to provider‐administered medical abortion, after an initial clinic visit. Most studies (16) were conducted in low‐to‐middle resource settings and two studies in high‐resource settings. The evidence described in this review is from studies published before 10 July 2019. 
Key results 
Women who self‐administer medical abortion drugs in early pregnancy (up to nine weeks gestational age) experience similar rates of completed abortion as women who undergo provider‐administered procedures in low‐to‐middle and high‐resource settings. Evidence about safety is uncertain. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence for the success of self‐administered medical abortion compared to provider‐administered medical abortion was of moderate certainty, due to low‐certainty studies. The evidence for the safety of these interventions was very low, due to low‐certainty studies.  
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Can Women Safely Take Abortion Pills at Home Without a Healthcare Provider Present?

## Rationale

**What is medical abortion?**
Medical abortion uses pills to end an early pregnancy. Women take these pills to safely end a pregnancy in the first nine weeks.

**Two ways to take abortion pills:**
Some women take abortion pills at a clinic with a doctor or nurse watching them. This is called provider-administered medical abortion. Other women take the pills at home on their own after visiting a clinic once. This is called self-administered medical abortion.

**Why was this study needed?**
More women now have access to abortion pills. Many women want more control over their abortion care. Taking pills at home may be easier for some women. But doctors need to know if taking pills at home is as safe and works as well as taking them at a clinic.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Researchers wanted to compare the two methods. They wanted to know if women taking pills at home have the same success as women taking pills at a clinic. They also wanted to know if both methods are equally safe.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was a review study. Researchers looked at 18 different studies that were already published. They combined the results from all these studies.

**Who was in the studies?**
The studies included 11,043 women total. All women were in early pregnancy, up to nine weeks. The studies took place in 10 different countries. Most studies (16 studies) were in countries with fewer resources. Two studies were in countries with more resources.

**What did the studies compare?**
All studies compared two groups of women. One group took abortion pills at home without a provider present. The other group took pills with a provider watching. All women visited a clinic at least once before taking the pills. At this visit, they got information and resources about the abortion process.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

**Success rates:**
Women who took abortion pills at home had similar success rates as women who took pills at a clinic. The abortion completed successfully in both groups at about the same rate. This was true in countries with more resources and countries with fewer resources.

**Safety:**
The researchers could not be certain about safety. The studies did not provide clear information about whether one method was safer than the other.

**Quality of the evidence:**
The evidence about success was moderate quality. This means researchers are fairly confident in the results. The evidence about safety was very low quality. This means researchers cannot be confident about safety based on these studies.

**What do these results mean?**
Women in early pregnancy can successfully take abortion pills at home. Success rates are similar to taking pills at a clinic. Women should receive proper information and resources before taking pills at home. More research is needed to better understand safety.

**Why is this important?**
These findings suggest that self-administered medical abortion could be a good option for women. It may give women more control over their care. It may also make abortion care easier to access. However, women still need good information and support from healthcare providers."
10.1002-14651858.CD013186-pls.txt,"What is the diagnostic accuracy of computer‐assisted diagnosis techniques for the detection of skin cancer in adults? 
Why is improving the diagnosis of skin cancer important? 
There are a number of different types of skin cancer, including melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms. If it is not recognised early treatment can be delayed and this risks the melanoma spreading to other organs in the body and may eventually lead to death. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and BCC are considered less dangerous, as they are localised (less likely to spread to other parts of the body compared to melanoma). However, cSCC can spread to other parts of the body and BCC can cause disfigurement if not recognised early. Diagnosing a skin cancer when it is not actually present (a false‐positive result) might result in unnecessary surgery and other investigations and can cause stress and anxiety to the patient. Missing a diagnosis of skin cancer may result in the wrong treatment being used or lead to a delay in effective treatment. 
What is the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate computer–assisted diagnosis (CAD) is for diagnosing melanoma, BCC or cSCC. The review also compared the accuracy of two different types of CAD, and compared the accuracy of CAD with diagnosis by a doctor using a handheld illuminated microscope (a dermatoscope or ‘dermoscopy’). We included 42 studies to answer these questions. 
What was studied in the review? 
A number of tools are available to skin cancer specialists which allow a more detailed examination of the skin compared to examination by the naked eye alone. Currently a dermatoscope which magnifies the skin lesion (a mole or area of skin with an unusual appearance in comparison with the surrounding skin) using a bright light source is used by most skin cancer specialists. CAD tests are computer systems that analyse information about skin lesions obtained from a dermatoscope or other techniques that use light to describe the features of a skin lesion (spectroscopy) to produce a result indicating whether skin cancer is likely to be present. We included CAD systems that get their information from dermoscopic images of lesions (Derm–CAD), or that use data from spectroscopy. Most of the spectroscopy studies used data from multispectral imaging (MSI–CAD) and are the main focus here. When a skin cancer specialist finds a lesion is suspicious using visual examination with or without additional dermoscopy, results from CAD systems can be used alone to make a diagnosis of skin cancer (CAD–based diagnosis), or can be used by doctors in addition to their visual inspection examination of a skin lesion to help them reach a diagnosis (CAD–aided diagnosis). Researchers examined how useful CAD systems are to help diagnose skin cancers in addition to visual inspection and dermoscopy. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review included 42 studies looking at CAD systems for the diagnosis of melanoma. There was not enough evidence to determine the accuracy of CAD systems for the diagnosis of BCC (3 studies) or cSCC (1 study). 
Derm‐CAD results for diagnosis of melanoma  
The main results for Derm‐CAD are based on 22 studies including 8992 lesions.
Applied to a group of 1000 skin lesions, of which 200 (20%) are given a final diagnosis* of melanoma, the results suggest that: 
‐ An estimated 386 people will have a Derm–CAD result suggesting that a melanoma is present, and of these 206 (53%) will not actually have a melanoma (false‐positive result) 
‐ Of the 614 people with a Derm–CAD result indicating that no melanoma is present, 20 (3%) will in fact actually have a melanoma (false‐negative result) 
There was no evidence to suggest that dermoscopy or Derm–CAD was different in its ability to detect or rule out melanoma. 
MSI‐CAD results for diagnosis of melanoma  
The main results for MSI–CAD are based on eight studies including 2401 lesions. In a group of 1000 people, of whom 200 (20%) actually do have melanoma*, then: 
‐ An estimated 637 people will have an MSI–CAD result suggesting that a melanoma is present, and of these 451 (71%) will not actually have a melanoma (false‐positive result) 
‐ Of the 363 people with an MSI–CAD result indicating that no melanoma is present, 14 (4%) will in fact have a melanoma (false‐negative result) 
MSI–CAD detects more melanomas, but possibly produces more false‐positive results (an increase in unnecessary surgery). 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
Incomplete reporting of studies made it difficult for us to judge how reliable they were. Many studies had important limitations. Some studies only included particular types of skin lesions or excluded lesions that were considered difficult to diagnose. Importantly, most of the studies only included skin lesions with a biopsy result, which means that only a sample of lesions that would be seen by a doctor in practice were included. These characteristics may result in CAD systems appearing more or less accurate than they actually are. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies were largely conducted in Europe (29, 69%) and North America (8, 19%). Mean age (reported in 6/42 studies) ranged from 32 to 49 years for melanoma. The percentage of people with a final diagnosis of melanoma ranged from 1% to 52%. It was not always possible to tell whether suspicion of skin cancer in study participants was based on clinical examination alone, or both clinical and dermoscopic examinations. Almost all studies were done in people with skin lesions who were seen at specialist clinics rather than by doctors in primary care. 
What are the implications of this review? 
CAD systems appear to be accurate for identification of melanomas in skin lesions that have already been selected for excision on the basis of clinical examination (visual inspection and dermoscopy). It is possible that some CAD systems identify more melanomas than doctors using dermoscopy images. However, CAD systems also produced far more false‐positive diagnoses than dermoscopy, and could lead to considerable increases in unnecessary surgery. The performance of CAD systems for detecting BCC and cSCC skin cancers is unclear. More studies are needed to evaluate the use of CAD by doctors for the diagnosis of skin cancer in comparison to face‐to‐face diagnosis using dermoscopy, both in primary care and in specialist skin cancer clinics. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies, biopsy, clinical follow up, or specialist clinician diagnosis were the reference standards (means of establishing the final diagnosis). 
","# Plain Language Summary: Computer Programs to Help Detect Skin Cancer

## Plain Title
How Well Do Computer Programs Detect Skin Cancer in Adults?

## Rationale

### What is skin cancer and why does it matter?

Skin cancer comes in different types. The three main types are melanoma, basal cell cancer (BCC), and squamous cell cancer (SCC).

Melanoma is the most dangerous type. If doctors do not find it early, it can spread to other parts of the body. This can lead to death.

BCC and SCC are less likely to spread. But SCC can sometimes spread to other body parts. BCC can cause harm to how a person looks if not found early.

### Why is correct diagnosis important?

Getting the diagnosis wrong causes problems. If a doctor says someone has skin cancer when they do not, the person may have surgery they do not need. This causes worry and stress.

If a doctor misses skin cancer, the person may not get the right treatment. Or treatment may start too late.

### What are computer programs for skin cancer?

Doctors use special tools to look closely at the skin. One common tool is called a dermatoscope. It uses bright light and makes the skin look bigger.

Computer programs can help doctors decide if a spot on the skin is cancer. These programs are called CAD (computer-assisted diagnosis). They look at pictures or light data from skin spots. Then they give a result about whether cancer might be present.

There are two main types:
- Derm-CAD: Uses pictures taken with a dermatoscope
- MSI-CAD: Uses data from special light tests

### Why was this study needed?

Doctors wanted to know how well these computer programs work. They wanted to compare them to doctors looking at skin with a dermatoscope. This information helps doctors decide if computer programs should be used.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?

This was a review study. Researchers looked at many other studies done before. They combined the results to see the big picture.

They included 42 studies in total. These studies tested computer programs for finding skin cancer.

### Who was in these studies?

Most studies took place in Europe (29 studies) and North America (8 studies).

The people in the studies had spots on their skin that looked unusual. Most were seen at special skin clinics, not regular doctor offices.

The average age ranged from 32 to 49 years in the studies that reported age.

The studies included both men and women.

### What did the studies measure?

The studies looked at how often the computer programs were right or wrong. They compared computer results to the final diagnosis. The final diagnosis came from a skin sample test (biopsy), watching the spot over time, or an expert doctor's opinion.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

The review found enough information about melanoma. There was not enough information about BCC or SCC.

### Results for Derm-CAD (computer programs using dermatoscope pictures)

Researchers looked at 22 studies with 8,992 skin spots.

Imagine 1,000 skin spots. Of these, 200 actually are melanoma.

Here is what would happen with Derm-CAD:
- 386 spots would test positive for melanoma
- Of these 386, only 180 actually have melanoma
- This means 206 people would be told they might have melanoma when they do not (false alarm)
- 614 spots would test negative for melanoma
- Of these 614, most are correct
- But 20 people actually do have melanoma that was missed

When researchers compared Derm-CAD to doctors using dermatoscopes, they found no clear difference.

### Results for MSI-CAD (computer programs using light data)

Researchers looked at 8 studies with 2,401 skin spots.

Again, imagine 1,000 skin spots where 200 are melanoma.

Here is what would happen with MSI-CAD:
- 637 spots would test positive for melanoma
- Of these 637, only 186 actually have melanoma
- This means 451 people would get false alarms
- 363 spots would test negative
- Of these, 14 people actually have melanoma that was missed

MSI-CAD finds more melanomas. But it also gives many more false alarms. This could lead to many people having surgery they do not need.

### How reliable are these results?

Many studies had problems. Some only included certain types of skin spots. Some left out spots that were hard to diagnose. Most only included spots that were already chosen for removal. This may make the computer programs look better or worse than they really are.

### What does this mean?

Computer programs can find melanoma in skin spots that doctors already think look suspicious. Some computer programs may find more melanomas than doctors using dermatoscopes alone.

But computer programs also give many false alarms. This could lead to much more unnecessary surgery.

We do not know enough about how well these programs work for BCC and SCC.

More studies are needed. Studies should test how well computer programs work when doctors use them in regular practice. This includes both regular doctor offices and special skin clinics.

### When was this review done?

Researchers looked at studies published up to August 2016."
10.1002-14651858.CD013187-pls.txt,"How accurate is exfoliative cytology ('skin scrape' cytology) for diagnosing basal cell carcinoma and other skin cancers in adults? 
Why is improving the diagnosis of skin cancer important? 
There are a number of different types of skin cancer. The most common is basal cell carcinoma (BCC). BCC is a localised cancer that can grow and destroy the skin around it. They rarely spread into the body like other cancers can. Very small or superficial low‐risk BCCs can generally be treated with treatments such as creams rather than surgery, while it is better to surgically remove BCCs that are more likely to grow and spread. Radiotherapy (a treatment where radiation is used to kill cancer cells) can also be used if BCCs are very large or cannot be removed by surgery. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is also usually a localised skin cancer. In a small proportion of cases it can spread to other parts of the body, so the best treatment is to remove it using surgery. Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer as it has a higher potential to spread to other parts of the body, and so it is vital to recognise it and remove it early. If people with BCC do not receive the correct diagnosis (known as a false negative test result), their treatment can be delayed, making the surgical procedure more complicated. Diagnosing BCC when it is actually something else (a false positive result) may result in unnecessary treatment, surgery or other investigations and can cause the patient stress and anxiety. If BCC is incorrectly diagnosed in an individual who actually has an cSCC or melanoma, effective treatment can be delayed and this might lead to a greater chance that the cSCC or melanoma spreads to other organs in the body, which can be very serious. 
What is the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate a technique called 'exfoliative cytology' is for diagnosing skin cancer. Researchers in Cochrane found nine studies to answer this question. Nine studies were concerned with the diagnosis of BCC, two with the diagnosis of cSCC and one with the diagnosis of melanoma. 
What was studied in the review? 
Exfoliative cytology means scraping the surface of a possible skin cancer with a knife and then spreading a small layer of the scrape onto a glass slide so that the cells in the scrape can be stained and looked at under a microscope. It is less invasive than skin biopsy and quick to perform, with results available immediately. This could save patients an additional clinic visit to receive skin biopsy results. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review examined nine studies with a total of 1655 lesions (a mole or area of skin with an unusual appearance in comparison with the surrounding skin) that were given these final diagnoses*: 1120 BCCs, 41 cSCCs and 10 melanomas. 
For identifying BCC, seven studies show the effect of using exfoliative cytology to confirm BCC in lesions that doctors already suspected were BCCs. In a group of 1000 such lesions, of which 860 (86%) actually do have BCC, then: 
‐ an estimated 853 people will have an exfoliative cytology result confirming that a BCC is present. Of these 14 (1.6%) will not actually have a BCC (false positive result); 
‐ of the 147 people with an exfoliative cytology result indicating that no BCC is present, 21 (14%) will in fact actually have a BCC (false negative result). 
One study compared the accuracy of exfoliative cytology to using a hand‐held microscope (dermoscopy) for making a diagnosis of BCC but used a different method of removing cells and included patients with a higher risk of melanoma than found in the other eight studies. 
There was not enough evidence to determine the accuracy of exfoliative cytology for diagnosing cSCC or melanoma. 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
The small number of studies included in this review, poor description of how patients were selected to be included in the study, and limited information on how the test results were used to make diagnoses, reduces the reliability of our results. 
The studies did not explain how patients had been referred to have the exfoliative cytology test. Most important of all, the test was only used in people in whom doctors had already diagnosed a BCC just by looking at the skin lesion. In other words, the test was being used to confirm a doctor's diagnosis. Most studies did not include enough people with skin lesions that are similar in appearance to a BCC to be sure that this test correctly identifies a BCC. This may cause exfoliative cytology to appear more accurate than it would be in actual practice. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies were conducted in the UK, across Europe and in Australia. Study authors rarely described patient characteristics, such as age and location of the lesion. The percentage of people included in the studies with a final diagnosis of BCC ranged from 18% to 90% (nine studies). For cSCC it was 4% and 18% (two studies), and for melanoma it was 5% (one study). It was not possible to tell from the studies how clinicians had decided that study participants had lesions that could be a skin cancer. 
What are the implications of this review? 
No research has been done using exfoliative cytology to diagnose a skin cancer when a patient is first seen by a doctor. The results of this review suggest that exfoliative cytology can help to confirm BCC in patients with skin lesions that a doctor already suspects of being a BCC. This test could be useful for patients with BCCs that need non‐surgical treatments, such as radiotherapy, where a tissue diagnosis is needed before the treatment can be given. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies, biopsy was the reference standard (means of establishing the final diagnosis). 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing Skin Scrapes to Find Skin Cancer

## Plain Title
How Well Does Scraping the Skin Help Doctors Find Skin Cancer?

## Rationale

**What is skin cancer?**
Skin cancer comes in different types. The most common type is basal cell cancer (also called BCC). BCC grows slowly and harms the skin around it. It rarely spreads inside the body. Doctors can treat small BCCs with creams. Larger BCCs need surgery to remove them.

Another type is squamous cell cancer (also called cSCC). This cancer usually stays in one place. But sometimes it can spread to other body parts. Doctors remove it with surgery.

Melanoma is the most dangerous skin cancer. It can spread to other organs more easily. Doctors must find it and remove it quickly.

**Why does correct diagnosis matter?**
Getting the wrong answer causes problems. If a doctor misses a BCC, treatment gets delayed. Surgery becomes harder later. If a doctor says someone has BCC when they do not, the person may get treatment they do not need. This causes worry and stress.

The worst mistake is calling a melanoma or cSCC a BCC. The person does not get the right treatment fast enough. The cancer might spread to other organs. This can be very serious.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors need good ways to check if a skin spot is cancer. This study looked at a test called skin scraping. Researchers wanted to know if this test works well.

## Trial Design

**How does the skin scrape test work?**
The doctor uses a small knife to scrape the top of the skin spot. The scrape goes onto a glass slide. A lab worker adds color to the cells. Then someone looks at the cells under a microscope.

This test is quick and simple. It does not cut deep into the skin like a biopsy does. Results come back right away. Patients do not need to come back for a second visit.

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at nine studies done by other scientists. These studies included 1,655 skin spots from patients. The studies took place in the UK, Europe, and Australia.

The skin spots included:
- 1,120 BCCs
- 41 cSCCs  
- 10 melanomas

Most studies did not describe patient ages or where the skin spots were located. The studies were published up to August 2016.

**Who was in these studies?**
The studies included adults with skin spots that doctors thought might be cancer. Most patients had spots that doctors already believed were BCCs. The studies wanted to see if the scrape test agreed with what doctors thought.

## Results

**What did the study find about BCC?**
Seven studies tested the skin scrape for BCC. The test worked fairly well when doctors already thought a spot was BCC.

Here is an example with 1,000 skin spots:
- 860 spots truly are BCC
- 140 spots are not BCC

With the skin scrape test:
- 853 tests say BCC is present
- Of these 853, about 14 are wrong (the spot is not really BCC)
- 147 tests say no BCC is present  
- Of these 147, about 21 are wrong (the spot really is BCC)

This means the test misses about 1 in 7 BCCs. It also says BCC is there when it is not about 1 in 60 times.

One study compared skin scraping to using a special hand-held microscope. But this study used different methods. It included patients at higher risk for melanoma.

**What about other skin cancers?**
The studies did not include enough people with cSCC or melanoma. Researchers could not tell if the test works well for these cancers.

**How reliable are these results?**
The results have some problems. The studies were small. They did not explain well how they picked patients. Most studies only tested people when doctors already thought the spot was BCC. They did not test many spots that look like BCC but are not.

This makes the test look better than it might work in real life. When a doctor first sees a patient with a skin spot, the test might not work as well.

**What does this mean for patients?**
The skin scrape test can help confirm BCC when a doctor already thinks a spot is BCC. It could help patients who need treatments like radiation instead of surgery. These treatments need a tissue test first.

But doctors should not use this test alone to diagnose skin cancer. More research is needed to see if it works when doctors first examine patients.

**What research is still needed?**
No studies have tested skin scraping when patients first visit a doctor about a skin spot. More research should test the scrape method at that early stage."
10.1002-14651858.CD013189-pls.txt,"What is the diagnostic accuracy of optical coherence tomography (OCT), an imaging test, for the detection of skin cancer in adults? 
Why is improving the diagnosis of skin cancer important? 
There are several different types of skin cancer. Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms, and it is important that it is recognised early so that it can be removed. If it is not recognised (also known as a false‐negative test result), treatment can be delayed, and this risks the melanoma spreading to other organs in the body, which may lead to eventual death. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) are usually localised (i.e. limited to a certain part of the body) skin cancers, although cSCC can spread to other parts of the body and BCC can cause disfigurement if not recognised early. Diagnosing a skin cancer when it is not actually present (a false‐positive result) may result in unnecessary surgery and other investigations and can cause stress and anxiety to the patient. Making the correct diagnosis is important, and mistaking one skin cancer for another can lead to the wrong treatment being used or lead to a delay in effective treatment. 
What is the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate optical coherence tomography (OCT) is for diagnosing skin cancer. Researchers in Cochrane included five studies to answer this question. Two studies were concerned with the diagnosis of melanoma and three with the diagnosis of BCC. 
What was studied in the review? 
A number of tools are available to skin cancer specialists which allow a more detailed examination of the skin compared to examination by the naked eye alone. Currently, a dermoscope is used by most skin cancer specialists, which magnifies the skin lesion (a mole or area of skin with an unusual appearance in comparison with the surrounding skin) using a bright light source. OCT magnifies the surface of a skin lesion to the level of that seen using a microscope using near‐infrared light. It is quick to perform but is more expensive compared to dermoscopy and requires specialist training. Review authors examined how useful OCT is to help diagnose skin cancers when used after visual inspection or visual inspection plus dermoscopy. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review included five studies: two studies with 97 participants with 133 skin lesions suspected of being melanoma, and three studies with 305 participants with 396 lesions suspected of being BCC of which one (50 lesions) also analysed cSCCs (nine lesions). 
The studies investigating the accuracy of OCT for diagnosing melanoma were small and too different from each other to allow a reliable estimate of the accuracy of OCT for melanoma to be made. Similarly, only one small, low‐quality study investigated the accuracy of OCT for diagnosing cSCC. 
For identifying BCC, two studies showed the effects of skin specialists using OCT after visual inspection alone, or visual inspection with dermoscopic examination. These two studies indicated that in theory, if OCT were to be used in a group of 1000 people with skin lesions that were particularly difficult to diagnose, of whom 600 (60%) actually had BCC, then: 
‐ an estimated 662 people would have an OCT result confirming that a BCC was present and of these 93 (14%) would not actually have had a BCC (false‐positive result); 
‐ of the 338 people with an OCT result indicating that no BCC was present, 31 (9%) would actually have a BCC (false‐negative result). 
Compared to making a diagnosis of BCC using visual inspection plus dermoscopy, the addition of OCT in this group would reduce the number of false‐positive results by 87 (thus reducing unnecessary surgical procedures) and would miss 53 fewer BCCs. 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
In all included studies, the diagnosis of skin cancer was made by lesion biopsy (OCT/dermoscopy positive) (a biopsy involves taking a sample of body cells and examining them under a microscope), and the absence of skin cancer was confirmed by biopsy (OCT/dermoscopy negative)*. This is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether people really had skin cancer. However, the small number of studies included in this review, and variability between them, reduced the reliability of findings. Included studies also had important limitations, in particular study participants were from more restricted groups than would be eligible for an OCT scan in practice (e.g. all studies included people with skin lesions that had already been selected for surgical removal), while the way in which OCT was used may not reflect real‐life situations. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies were conducted in Europe and the US only. Average age (reported in only two studies) was 46 years for melanoma and 63 years for BCC. The percentage of people with a final diagnosis of melanoma was 23% and 27% (in two studies), ranged from 58% to 61% for BCC (three studies), and was 18% for cSCC (one study). For the diagnosis of BCC, the results apply to people with 'pink' and non‐pigmented skin lesions that the clinician considers particularly difficult to diagnose by the naked eye alone. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Not enough research has been done on using OCT in detecting skin cancers. The results of this review suggest that OCT might help to diagnose BCC when it is difficult to distinguish it from benign skin lesions, but it is not yet clear whether it can adequately distinguish between BCC, cSCC, and melanoma skin cancers. More studies are needed comparing OCT to dermoscopy and to other microscopic techniques (such as reflectance confocal microscopy) in well‐described groups of people with suspicious skin lesions. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies biopsy or clinical follow‐up were the standard comparisons.
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing a Skin Imaging Tool to Find Skin Cancer

## Plain Title
How Well Does OCT Scanning Work to Find Skin Cancer?

## Rationale

**What is skin cancer and why does it matter?**

Skin cancer comes in several types. Melanoma is one of the most deadly forms. Doctors need to find it early so they can remove it. If they miss it, the cancer can spread to other body parts. This can lead to death.

Two other types are basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). BCC usually stays in one spot. But it can damage the skin badly if not found early. cSCC can spread to other body parts.

**Why is getting the right diagnosis important?**

Finding cancer when it is not there causes problems. People may have surgery they do not need. This causes worry and stress. Missing cancer when it is there is worse. Treatment gets delayed. The cancer may grow or spread.

Mixing up one type of skin cancer for another is also bad. Doctors might use the wrong treatment. Or they might wait too long to start the right treatment.

**What is OCT and why study it?**

OCT stands for optical coherence tomography. It is a tool that takes very close pictures of the skin. It uses special light to see the skin like a microscope would. It works quickly but costs more than other tools. Doctors need special training to use it.

Right now, most skin doctors use a tool called a dermoscope. It makes the skin look bigger using bright light. OCT might work better than dermoscopy for finding skin cancer. This study wanted to find out how well OCT works.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at five earlier studies. They wanted to see how accurate OCT is. Two studies looked at melanoma. Three studies looked at BCC. One study also looked at cSCC.

**Who was in these studies?**

For melanoma studies: 97 people with 133 spots on their skin. Doctors thought these spots might be melanoma. The average age was 46 years.

For BCC studies: 305 people with 396 skin spots. Doctors thought these might be BCC. The average age was 63 years. One study also looked at 9 spots that might be cSCC.

All studies took place in Europe and the United States.

**How did doctors check if OCT was right?**

Doctors used OCT to look at skin spots. Then they took a small sample of skin. This is called a biopsy. They looked at the sample under a microscope. This told them if cancer was really there or not.

## Results

**What did the study find about melanoma?**

The two melanoma studies were too small. They were also too different from each other. Researchers could not tell how well OCT works for finding melanoma.

**What did the study find about cSCC?**

Only one small study looked at cSCC. The quality was low. Researchers could not make strong conclusions about OCT for cSCC.

**What did the study find about BCC?**

Two studies gave useful results for BCC. Here is an example to show what the results mean:

Imagine 1,000 people with hard-to-diagnose skin spots. Out of these 1,000 people, 600 really have BCC.

If doctors use OCT:
- 662 people would test positive for BCC
- Out of these 662, about 93 would not really have BCC (wrong positive result)
- 338 people would test negative for BCC
- Out of these 338, about 31 would really have BCC (missed cancer)

**How does OCT compare to dermoscopy?**

When doctors added OCT to dermoscopy, good things happened:
- 87 fewer people got wrong positive results
- This means less unnecessary surgery
- 53 fewer BCCs were missed
- This means more cancers were found

**How reliable are these results?**

The studies had some problems. Only a few studies were done. The studies were different from each other. The people in the studies were not like all people who might get OCT in real life. All people in these studies already had skin spots picked for removal.

**What does this mean for patients?**

OCT might help find BCC when the spot is hard to diagnose. It seems to work better than dermoscopy alone for BCC. But we do not know yet if OCT can tell the difference between BCC, cSCC, and melanoma.

**What is needed next?**

More studies are needed. These studies should compare OCT to dermoscopy. They should also compare OCT to other tools. They should include more types of patients.

This review used studies published through August 2016."
10.1002-14651858.CD013190-pls.txt,"What is the diagnostic accuracy of the imaging test reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) for the detection of melanoma in adults? 
What was the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) was on its own and used in addition to dermoscopy compared to dermoscopy alone for diagnosing melanoma. Review authors in Cochrane included 18 publications to answer this question. 
Why is improving the diagnosis of melanoma important? 
Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer. Not recognising a melanoma when it is present (called a false negative test result) delays surgery to remove it, risking cancer spreading to other parts in the body and possibly death. Diagnosing a skin lesion as a melanoma when it is not present (called a false positive result) may result in unnecessary surgery, further investigations, and patient anxiety. 
What did the review study? 
Microscopic techniques are used by skin cancer specialists to allow a more detailed, magnified examination of suspicious skin lesions than can be achieved using the naked eye alone. Currently, dermoscopy (a handheld device using natural light) can be used as part of the clinical examination of suspicious skin lesions. RCM is a new microscopic technique (a handheld device or static unit using infrared light) that can visualise deeper layers of the skin compared to dermoscopy. Both techniques are painless procedures, but RCM is more expensive, time consuming, and requires additional training. Dermoscopy can be used by general practitioners whereas RCM is likely to only be used by secondary care specialists in people who have been referred with a lesion suspicious for skin cancer. We sought to find out whether RCM should be used instead of, or in addition to, dermoscopy, to diagnose melanoma in any suspicious skin lesion or only in particularly difficult to diagnose skin lesions. 
What were the main results of the review? 
The review included 18 publications reporting data for 19 groups of participants with lesions suspected of melanoma. The main results were based on 16 of the 19 datasets (sets of information and results). 
The review included nine datasets with 1452 lesions in people with any suspicious skin lesion, three of which compared RCM to dermoscopy. The results suggested that in 1000 lesions, of which 300 (30%) actually are melanoma: 
‐ an estimated 396 would have an RCM result indicating melanoma was present, and of these, 126 (32%) would not be melanoma (false positive results); ‐ in the same group of 1000 lesions, dermoscopy would produce 406 false positive results, meaning RCM would avoid unnecessary surgery in 280 lesions compared to dermoscopy; ‐ of the 604 lesions with an RCM result indicating that melanoma was not present (and 324 lesions with a dermoscopy result indicating that melanoma was not present), 30 would actually be melanoma (false negative results). This equated to a false negative rate of 5% for RCM and 9% for dermoscopy. 
The review also included seven datasets with 1177 lesions in people with particularly difficult to diagnose skin lesions, three of which compared RCM to dermoscopy. The results suggested that if skin specialists used RCM in a group of 1000 lesions, of which 200 (20%) were actually melanoma: 
‐ an estimated 292 would have an RCM result indicating melanoma was present, and of these, 112 (38%) would not be melanoma (false positive results); ‐ in the same group of 1000 lesions, dermoscopy would produce 408 false positive results, meaning RCM would avoid unnecessary surgery in 296 lesions compared to dermoscopy; ‐ of the 708 lesions with an RCM result indicating that melanoma was not present (and 412 lesions with a dermoscopy result indicating that melanoma was not present), 20 would actually have melanoma (false negative results). This equates to a false negative rate of 3% for RCM and 5% for dermoscopy. 
How reliable were the results of the studies of this review? 
In all included studies, the diagnosis of melanoma was made by lesion biopsy (RCM/dermoscopy positive) (a biopsy involves taking a sample of body cells and examining them under a microscope), and the absence of melanoma was confirmed by biopsy or by follow‐up over time to make sure the skin lesion remained negative for melanoma (RCM/dermoscopy negative)*. This is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether people really had melanoma. Only a small number of studies compared the accuracy of dermoscopy and RCM. Most were conducted by specialist research teams with high levels of experience with RCM. Therefore, RCM may have appeared more accurate than it actually was. Participants in the nine studies of any suspicious lesion may have had very obvious disease compared to that seen in practice leading to a lower number of false positive results than would actually occur. It is not possible to recommend a definition of a positive RCM test that will reliably produce the results presented here due to differences between studies. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Eleven studies were undertaken in Europe (61%), with the remainder undertaken in Oceania, North America, or more than one continent. Mean age ranged from 39 to 54.7 years. The percentage of people with melanoma ranged between 1.9% and 41.5% (a median (midpoint reading) of 19% for difficult to diagnose skin lesions and 32% for any suspicious lesion). The majority of studies only included people with certain types of skin lesion. In many studies, it was not clear what tests participants had received before RCM. 
What are the implications of this review? 
RCM appears to be an accurate test for identifying melanoma, and it may reduce the number of people receiving unnecessary surgery by up to three‐quarters compared to dermoscopy. There is considerable variation and uncertainty in results and in study conduct, reducing the reliability of findings. Use of RCM may be of most benefit in people with particularly difficult to diagnose lesions rather than people with any lesion suspicious for melanoma. Further research comparing RCM and dermoscopy in well described groups of people with difficult to diagnose skin lesions is needed. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.

","# Plain Language Summary: Testing a New Skin Imaging Tool to Find Melanoma

## Plain Title

How Well Does a New Skin Imaging Tool Called RCM Find Melanoma Compared to the Current Tool Called Dermoscopy?

## Rationale

**What is melanoma and why does it matter?**

Melanoma is a very serious type of skin cancer. It can spread to other parts of the body and may cause death if not found and removed early. Doctors need good tools to tell which skin spots are melanoma and which are not.

**What happens when tests get it wrong?**

Missing a melanoma (when the test says it is not cancer but it really is) means the cancer is not removed quickly. This lets it spread and become more dangerous.

Saying a spot is melanoma when it is not (when the test says it is cancer but it really is not) means people have surgery they do not need. This causes worry and extra doctor visits.

**What tools do doctors use now?**

Right now, doctors use a tool called dermoscopy to look at skin spots. Dermoscopy is a handheld device that uses regular light. It lets doctors see the skin better than with just their eyes. Any doctor can use it.

**What is the new tool being tested?**

The new tool is called RCM (reflectance confocal microscopy). RCM also looks at skin spots but uses a different type of light called infrared light. It can see deeper into the skin than dermoscopy. Both tools are painless.

However, RCM costs more money. It takes more time to use. Doctors need special training to use it. Only skin specialists would use RCM, not regular doctors.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if RCM works better than dermoscopy. They wanted to know if doctors should use RCM instead of dermoscopy or along with it.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at 18 published reports. These reports included information from 19 groups of people.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included adults with skin spots that might be melanoma. Most studies were done in Europe. Some were done in other parts of the world.

People in the studies were between 39 and 54 years old on average. Some studies looked at any suspicious skin spot. Other studies looked only at spots that were very hard to diagnose.

**How did researchers know if spots were really melanoma?**

Doctors took small samples of skin (called biopsies) from spots. They looked at these samples under a microscope. This told them if the spot was really melanoma or not.

For some spots, doctors watched them over time to make sure they stayed healthy.

**How long did the study last?**

This review looked at studies published up to August 2016.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The review looked at two groups of people:

**Group 1: People with any suspicious skin spot**

Imagine 1,000 skin spots. In reality, 300 of these spots are melanoma.

When doctors used RCM:
- RCM said 396 spots were melanoma
- Of these 396, about 126 were not really melanoma (wrong results)
- RCM said 604 spots were not melanoma
- Of these 604, about 30 were really melanoma (missed cancers)

When doctors used dermoscopy on the same 1,000 spots:
- Dermoscopy got 406 wrong results (said spots were melanoma when they were not)
- Dermoscopy missed 9 out of every 100 melanomas

This means RCM would prevent unnecessary surgery in 280 people compared to dermoscopy.

**Group 2: People with very hard to diagnose skin spots**

Imagine 1,000 skin spots. In reality, 200 of these spots are melanoma.

When doctors used RCM:
- RCM said 292 spots were melanoma
- Of these 292, about 112 were not really melanoma (wrong results)
- RCM said 708 spots were not melanoma
- Of these 708, about 20 were really melanoma (missed cancers)

When doctors used dermoscopy on the same 1,000 spots:
- Dermoscopy got 408 wrong results
- Dermoscopy missed 5 out of every 100 melanomas

This means RCM would prevent unnecessary surgery in 296 people compared to dermoscopy.

**How reliable are these results?**

Only a few studies compared RCM directly to dermoscopy. Most studies were done by experts with lots of RCM experience. This might make RCM look better than it really is in regular practice.

**What do the results mean?**

RCM appears to work well for finding melanoma. It may reduce unnecessary surgeries by up to three-quarters compared to dermoscopy.

RCM may help most with spots that are very hard to diagnose. More research is needed to know exactly when doctors should use RCM."

What is the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is on its own or compared to inspection of a skin lesion with the naked eye alone or using a hand‐held microscope called dermoscopy for diagnosing two common forms of keratinocyte skin cancer: basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) in adults. Review authors in Cochrane included 10 studies to answer this question. 
Why is improving the diagnosis of BCC or cSCC important? 
There are a number of different types of skin cancer. BCC and cSCC are usually localised skin cancers. Making the correct diagnosis is important because mistaking one skin cancer for another can lead to the wrong treatment being used or lead to a delay in effective treatment. A missed diagnosis of BCC (known as a false‐negative result) can result in the missed BCC growing and causing disfigurement. A missed diagnosis of cSCC is more serious as it could spread to other parts of the body. Diagnosing a skin cancer when it is not actually present (a false‐positive result) may result in unnecessary biopsy or treatment and can cause discomfort and worry to patients. 
What was studied in the review? 
Microscopic techniques are used by skin cancer specialists to provide a more detailed, magnified examination of suspicious skin lesions than can be achieved using the naked eye alone. Currently, dermoscopy is used by doctors as part of the examination of suspicious skin lesions. RCM is a new microscopic technique to increase the magnification. It is a hand‐held device or static unit using infrared light that can visualise deeper layers of the skin when compared with dermoscopy. Both techniques are painless procedures, but RCM is more expensive, time consuming, and requires additional specialised training. Dermoscopy can be used by general practitioners (GP) whereas RCM is likely to only be used by hospital specialists for people who have been referred with a skin lesion that is suspected to be a skin cancer. We wanted to see if RCM should be used instead of, or as well as, inspection of a skin lesion with the naked eye alone or using dermoscopy to diagnose BCC or cSCC. The accuracy of the test was looked at when used on people with any suspicious skin lesion and also in people with skin lesions that were tricky to diagnose. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found 10 studies that included information on 11 groups of people with lesions suspicious for skin cancer. The main results were based on seven of the 11 sets of data: four in any lesion suspicious for skin cancer and three in particularly difficult to diagnose skin lesions. 
For the comparison of RCM versus dermoscopy, we found four sets of data that included 912 suspicious skin lesions. The results suggested that in a group of 1000 people with any suspicious lesion, of whom 125 (12.5%) really do have BCC: 
‐ an estimated 139 people will have an RCM result indicating BCC is present;
‐ of these, 44 (32%) people will not have BCC (false‐positive results) including one person with a melanoma mistaken for a BCC; 
‐ of the 861 people with an RCM result indicating that BCC is not present, 30 (3%) will actually have BCC. 
The review also included three sets of data on people that had 668 particularly difficult to diagnose skin lesions, one comparing RCM to dermoscopy. The results suggested that if RCM was to be used by skin specialists in a group of 1000 people, of whom 150 (15%) really do have BCC: 
‐ an estimated 269 people will have an RCM result indicating BCC is present;
‐ of these, 128 (48%) people will not have a BCC (known as a false‐positive result), including as many as 19 people with melanomas mistaken for BCCs; 
‐ of the 732 people with an RCM result indicating that BCC is not present, nine (1%) will actually have BCC. 
There was not enough evidence to determine the accuracy of RCM for the detection of cSCC in either population group. 
How reliable are the results of this review? 
There was a lot of variation in the results of the studies in this review. Poor reporting of study conduct made assessment of the reliability of studies difficult. It was unclear whether studies were representative of populations eligible for testing with RCM, and test interpretation was often undertaken using images, remotely from the patient and the interpreter blinded to clinical information that would normally be available in practice. Only one study compared the accuracy of dermoscopy and RCM. Most studies were conducted by specialist research teams with high levels of training and experience with RCM, meaning that RCM may appear better than it would be when used in everyday practice. Most studies reported diagnosis based on observers' subjective views, which might not be the same for people using the technique in everyday practice. In nine studies, the diagnosis of skin cancer was made by a skin biopsy or by following up those people over time to make sure they remained negative for skin cancer*. This is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether patients really had skin cancer. In one study, the absence of skin cancer was made by experts looking at the skin, a method that may be less reliable for deciding whether patients really had skin cancer. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Five studies were carried out in Europe (61%), and the rest in Asia, Oceania, North America, or more than one continent. The average ages of people who took part ranged from 41 to 65 years. The percentage of people with BCC in these studies ranged from 6% to 83% (a middle value of 12% for any suspicious lesion and 15% for difficult to diagnose skin lesions). For studies of RCM used for cSCC, the percentage of people with cSCC ranged between 4% and 13%. In many studies it was not clear what tests people taking part had received before RCM. 
What are the implications of this review? 
There was not enough good evidence to support the use of RCM for the diagnosis of BCC or cSCC outside of research studies. There was a lot of variation and uncertainty in results and in the ways studies were carried out, reducing the reliability of findings. Using RCM might avoid the need for a diagnostic biopsy in people who see a doctor with a high suspicion of a BCC lesion, but more research is needed to confirm this. Such research should compare RCM to dermoscopy in well‐described groups of people with suspicious skin lesions and they must say whether other skin cancers end up being missed or being wrongly classified as BCC.

","# Plain Language Summary: Testing a New Skin Imaging Tool to Find Skin Cancer

## Plain Title

How Well Does a Special Microscope Called RCM Find Two Common Types of Skin Cancer?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Skin cancer is a disease where skin cells grow out of control. Two common types are basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). BCC usually stays in one place on the skin. If doctors miss it, it can grow larger and damage the skin. cSCC is more serious because it can spread to other body parts.

**Why is getting the right diagnosis important?**

When doctors make mistakes, patients can have problems. If doctors miss a skin cancer, the cancer keeps growing. If doctors think a skin cancer is there when it is not, patients may have tests or treatments they do not need. This causes worry and discomfort.

**What is being tested?**

Doctors use special tools to look closely at spots on the skin. Right now, many doctors use a hand-held microscope called a dermoscope. This review looked at a newer tool called reflectance confocal microscopy, or RCM. RCM uses infrared light to see deeper into the skin than a dermoscope can. RCM costs more money and takes more time. Doctors need special training to use it. Hospital skin doctors would likely use RCM, not family doctors.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if RCM works better than dermoscopy for finding BCC and cSCC. They wanted to see if RCM should replace dermoscopy or be used along with it.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a single study. Researchers looked at 10 different studies done by other scientists. These studies included 11 groups of people. The researchers focused on 7 of these groups for their main findings.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included adults with spots on their skin that might be cancer. Some studies looked at any suspicious spot. Other studies looked at spots that were very hard to diagnose. People in the studies were between 41 and 65 years old on average. The studies took place mostly in Europe, but also in Asia, Australia, and North America.

**How many people were studied?**

For comparing RCM to dermoscopy in any suspicious spot, 912 skin spots were examined. For hard-to-diagnose spots, 668 skin spots were examined.

**How did researchers know if someone really had cancer?**

In 9 studies, doctors took a small piece of skin (called a biopsy) to test. Or they watched patients over time to make sure no cancer appeared. In 1 study, experts just looked at the skin carefully.

## Results

**What did the study find for any suspicious skin spot?**

The researchers looked at what would happen in a group of 1,000 people where 125 people actually have BCC.

Using RCM, 139 people would get a result saying BCC is present. Of these 139 people, 44 would not actually have BCC. This is called a false alarm. One of these false alarms would be melanoma, a different type of skin cancer, mistaken for BCC.

Of the 861 people whose RCM result said no BCC, 30 would actually have BCC. This means the cancer was missed.

**What did the study find for hard-to-diagnose spots?**

The researchers looked at what would happen in a group of 1,000 people where 150 people actually have BCC.

Using RCM, 269 people would get a result saying BCC is present. Of these 269 people, 128 would not actually have BCC. This includes up to 19 people with melanoma mistaken for BCC.

Of the 732 people whose RCM result said no BCC, 9 would actually have BCC.

**What about the other type of skin cancer (cSCC)?**

There was not enough information to know how well RCM finds cSCC.

**What do these results mean?**

There is not enough good evidence to recommend using RCM outside of research studies. The studies had many differences and problems. Most studies were done by expert teams with lots of training. RCM might not work as well when regular doctors use it. RCM might help avoid taking a biopsy in some cases, but more research is needed.

**What research is still needed?**

Future studies should compare RCM directly to dermoscopy. They should clearly describe the people being tested. They should report if other skin cancers get missed or wrongly labeled as BCC.

10.1002-14651858.CD013192-pls.txt,"How accurate are smartphone applications ('apps') for detecting melanoma in adults?
What is the aim of the review? 
We wanted to find out how well smartphone applications can help the general public understand whether their skin lesions might be melanoma. 
Why is improving the diagnosis of malignant melanoma skin cancer important? 
Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer. Not recognising a melanoma (a false negative test result) could delay seeking appropriate advice and surgery to remove it. This increases the risk of the cancer spreading to other organs in the body and possibly causing death. Diagnosing a skin lesion as a melanoma when it is not present (a false positive result) may cause anxiety and lead to unnecessary surgery and further investigations. 
What was studied in the review? 
Specialised applications ('apps') that provide advice on skin lesions or moles that might cause people concern are widely available for smartphones. Some apps allow people to photograph any skin lesion they might be worried about and then receive guidance on whether to get medical advice. Apps may automatically classify lesions as high or low risk, while others can act as store‐and‐forward devices where images are sent to an experienced professional, such as a dermatologist, who then makes a risk assessment based on the photo. Cochrane researchers found two studies, evaluating five apps that used automated analysis of images and one that used a store‐and‐forward approach, to evaluate suspicious skin lesions. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review included two studies with 332 lesions, including 86 melanomas, analysed by at least one smartphone application. Both studies used photographs of moles or skin lesions that were about to be removed because doctors had already decided they could be melanomas. The photographs were taken by doctors instead of people taking pictures of their lesions with their own smartphones. For these reasons, we are not able to make a reliable estimate about how well the apps actually work. 
Four apps that produce an immediate (automated) assessment of a skin lesion or mole that has been photographed by the smartphone missed between 7 and 55 melanomas. 
One app that sends the photograph of a mole or skin lesion to a dermatologist for assessment missed only one melanoma. Another 6 melanomas examined by the dermatologist via the application were not classified as high risk; instead the dermatologist was not able to classify the lesion as either 'atypical' (possibly a melanoma) or 'typical' (definitely not a melanoma). 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
The small number and poor quality of included studies reduces the reliability of findings. The people included were not typical of those who would use the applications in real life. The final diagnosis of melanoma was made by histology, which is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether patients really had melanoma*. However, the studies excluded between 2% and 18% of images because the applications failed to produce a recommendation. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies took place in the USA and Germany. They did not report key patient information such as age and gender. The percentage of people with a final diagnosis of melanoma was 18% and 35%, much higher than that observed in community settings. The definition of eligible patients was narrow in comparison to likely users of the applications. The photographs used were taken by doctors rather than by smartphone users, which seriously impacts the applicability of results. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Current smartphone applications using automated analysis are observed to have a high chance of missing melanomas (false negatives). Store‐and‐forward image applications could have a potential role in the timely identification of people with potentially malignant lesions by facilitating early engagement of those with suspicious skin lesions, but they have resource and workload implications. 
The development of applications to help identify people who might have melanoma is a fast‐moving field. The emergence of new applications, higher quality and better reported studies could change the conclusions of this review substantially.

## Plain Title
Testing Smartphone Apps That Check Moles and Skin Spots for Melanoma

## Rationale

**What is melanoma and why does it matter?**

Melanoma is a very serious type of skin cancer. It can spread to other parts of the body and cause death if not found early. Finding melanoma early is very important. Doctors can remove it with surgery before it spreads.

**Why is getting the right answer important?**

Missing a melanoma (saying it is safe when it is not) is dangerous. People may wait too long to see a doctor. The cancer could spread during this time.

Saying a mole is melanoma when it is not also causes problems. People may worry too much. They may have surgery they do not need.

**Why was this study needed?**

Many smartphone apps now claim they can check moles and skin spots. Some apps look at photos and tell you right away if you should worry. Other apps send your photo to a skin doctor who looks at it later.

People use these apps at home. But do they really work? Researchers wanted to find out how accurate these apps are.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked for studies that tested smartphone apps. They found two studies that tested six different apps.

The studies included 332 moles or skin spots. Of these, 86 were melanomas. The rest were not cancer.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies used photos of moles that doctors had already decided to remove. Doctors thought these moles might be melanomas. This is important because real app users would photograph all kinds of moles, not just worrying ones.

**Important limitation:**

Doctors took the photos in these studies. In real life, people would take their own photos at home. This makes a big difference in how well the apps might work.

**How did researchers know the final answer?**

After removal, doctors tested the moles in a lab. This is called a biopsy. This test is very accurate. It showed which moles were really melanomas.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The results were not good for most apps.

**Apps that give instant answers:**

Four apps looked at photos and gave answers right away. These apps missed many melanomas. They missed between 7 and 55 melanomas out of 86 total. This means many people with cancer would be told they were safe.

**Apps that send photos to doctors:**

One app sent photos to a skin doctor for review. This app only missed 1 melanoma. However, the doctor could not decide about 6 other melanomas. The doctor marked these as unclear instead of high risk.

**How reliable are these results?**

The results are not very reliable. Here is why:

- Only two small studies were done
- Doctors took the photos, not regular people
- The studies had more melanomas than normal (18 to 35 out of 100 moles)
- In real life, far fewer moles are melanomas
- Some apps could not read between 2 and 18 photos out of 100

**What do these results mean?**

Apps that give instant answers missed too many melanomas. They are not safe to use right now.

Apps that send photos to doctors might be more helpful. They could help people decide when to see a doctor. But this would require many doctors to look at photos. This takes time and money.

**Important note:**

This field changes very fast. New apps come out all the time. Better studies may change what we know. This review only includes studies up to August 2016.

**Bottom line:**

Current smartphone apps that check moles automatically are not accurate enough. They miss too many melanomas. If you are worried about a mole, see a doctor in person. Do not rely on an app alone.

Apps that connect you to a real skin doctor might be useful. But more research is needed.

10.1002-14651858.CD013193-pls.txt,"What is the diagnostic accuracy of teledermatology for the diagnosis of skin cancer in adults? 
Why is improving the diagnosis of skin cancer important? 
There are different types of skin cancer. Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms and it is important to identify it early so that it can be removed. If it is not recognised when first brought to the attention of doctors (also known as a false‐negative test result) treatment can be delayed resulting in the melanoma spreading to other organs in the body and possibly causing early death. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) are usually localised skin cancers, although cSCC can spread to other parts of the body and BCC can cause disfigurement if not recognised early. Calling something a skin cancer when it is not really a skin cancer (a false‐positive result) may result in unnecessary surgery and other investigations that can cause stress and worry to the patient. Making the correct diagnosis is important. Mistaking one skin cancer for another can lead to the wrong treatment being used or lead to a delay in effective treatment. 
What is the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether teledermatology is accurate enough to identify which people with skin lesions need to be referred to see a specialist dermatologist (a doctor concerned with disease of the skin) and who can be safely reassured that their lesion (damage or change of the skin) is not malignant. We included 22 studies to answer this question. 
What was studied in the review? 
Teledermatology means sending pictures of skin lesions or rashes to a specialist for advice on diagnosis or management. It is a way for primary care doctors (general practitioners (GPs)) to get an opinion from a specialist dermatologist without having to refer patients through the normal referral pathway. Teledermatology can involve sending photographs or magnified images of a skin lesion taken with a special camera (dermatoscope) to a skin specialist to look at or it might involve immediate discussion about a skin lesion between a GP and a skin specialist using videoconferencing. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review included 22 studies, 16 studies comparing teledermatology diagnoses to the final lesion diagnoses (diagnostic accuracy) for 4057 lesions and 879 malignant cases and five studies comparing teledermatology decisions to the decisions that would be made with the patient present (referral accuracy) for 1449 lesions and 270 'positive' cases. 
The studies were very different from each other in terms of the types of people with suspicious skin cancer lesions included and the type of teledermatology used. A single reliable estimate of the accuracy of teledermatology could not be made. For the correct diagnosis of a lesion to be a skin cancer, data suggested that less than 7% of malignant skin lesions were missed by teledermatology. Study results were too variable to tell us how many people would be referred unnecessarily for a specialist dermatology appointment following a teledermatology consultation. Without access to teledermatology services however, most of the lesions included in these studies would likely be referred to a dermatologist. 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
In the included studies, the final diagnosis of skin cancer was made by lesion biopsy (taking a small sample of the lesion so it could be examined under a microscope) and the absence of skin cancer was confirmed by biopsy or by follow‐up over time to make sure the skin lesion remained negative for melanoma. This is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether people really had skin cancer. In a few studies, a diagnosis of no skin cancer was made by a skin specialist rather than biopsy. This is less likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether people really had skin cancer*. Poor reporting of what was done in the study made it difficult for us to say how reliable the study results are. Selecting some patients from specialist clinics instead of primary care along with different ways of doing teledermatology were common problems. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies were conducted in: Europe (64%), North America (18%), South America (9%) or Oceania (9%). The average age of people who were studied was 52 years; however, several studies included at least some people under the age of 16 years. The percentage of people with skin cancer ranged between 2% and 88% with an average of 30%, which is much higher than would be observed in a primary care setting in the UK. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Teledermatology is likely to be a good way of helping GPs to decide which skin lesions need to be seen by a skin specialist. Our review suggests that using magnified images, in addition to photographs of the lesion, improves accuracy. More research is needed to establish the best way of providing teledermatology services. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies, biopsy, clinical follow‐up or specialist clinician diagnosis were the reference comparisons. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing if Remote Skin Checks Can Find Skin Cancer

## Plain Title
Can Doctors Diagnose Skin Cancer by Looking at Photos Sent from Other Doctors?

## Rationale

**What is skin cancer and why does it matter?**

Skin cancer comes in different types. Melanoma is one of the most deadly kinds. Doctors need to find it early so they can remove it. If doctors miss melanoma, it can spread to other body parts. This can lead to early death.

Two other types are basal cell cancer and squamous cell cancer. These usually stay in one spot on the skin. But squamous cell cancer can sometimes spread. Basal cell cancer can cause harm to how a person looks if not found early.

**What happens when doctors get it wrong?**

Sometimes doctors might think a spot is cancer when it is not. This is called a false positive. It can lead to surgery that was not needed. This causes worry and stress for patients.

Sometimes doctors might miss a real cancer. This is called a false negative. It can delay treatment. The cancer might get worse during this delay.

Getting the right answer matters. Mixing up one type of skin cancer for another can lead to wrong treatment or delays.

**Why study remote skin checks?**

Teledermatology means sending pictures of skin spots to a skin expert. The expert looks at the pictures and gives advice. This helps family doctors get expert opinions without sending patients to see the specialist in person.

Family doctors can send regular photos or special close-up images. These close-up images use a special camera called a dermatoscope. Sometimes doctors talk about the skin spot using video calls.

This study wanted to know if teledermatology works well enough. Can it help doctors decide who needs to see a skin specialist? Can it help doctors know when a skin spot is safe?

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 22 different studies. These studies tested how well teledermatology works.

Sixteen studies checked if teledermatology gave the right diagnosis. These studies looked at 4,057 skin spots. Of these spots, 879 were cancer.

Five studies checked if teledermatology helped doctors make good referral choices. These studies looked at 1,449 skin spots. Of these, 270 needed specialist care.

**Who was in these studies?**

Most studies took place in Europe. Some were in North America, South America, or Oceania.

The average age of people in the studies was 52 years. Some studies included people under 16 years old.

In these studies, 30 out of 100 skin spots were cancer. This is much higher than what family doctors normally see. In regular family doctor offices in the UK, far fewer spots are cancer.

**How did researchers check the results?**

Doctors took small samples of skin spots. They looked at these samples under a microscope. This showed if the spot was really cancer or not.

For spots that were not cancer, doctors either took samples or watched the spots over time. They made sure the spots stayed safe.

Some studies had skin experts look at spots without taking samples. This method is less reliable.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The studies were very different from each other. They looked at different types of people. They used different types of teledermatology. Because of this, researchers could not give one clear accuracy number.

The good news is that teledermatology missed fewer than 7 out of 100 real cancers. This means it catches most cancers.

The results varied too much to say how many people would be sent to specialists when they did not need to go. But remember, without teledermatology, most of these people would be sent to specialists anyway.

**What does this mean?**

Teledermatology seems to be a good tool. It helps family doctors decide which skin spots need expert care. Using special close-up images along with regular photos works better than photos alone.

**What is needed next?**

More research is needed. Scientists need to find the best way to provide these remote skin check services.

**How reliable are these findings?**

Some things made it hard to judge how reliable the results are. Studies did not always explain clearly what they did. Some studies looked at patients from specialist clinics instead of family doctor offices. Different studies used teledermatology in different ways.

**When was this review done?**

Researchers looked at studies published up to August 2016."
10.1002-14651858.CD013194-pls.txt,"How accurate is visual inspection of skin lesions with the naked eye for diagnosis of melanoma in adults? 
What is the aim of the review? 
Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer. The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate checking suspicious skin lesions (lumps, bumps, wounds, scratches or grazes) with the naked eye (visual inspection) can be to diagnose melanoma (diagnostic accuracy). The Review also investigated whether diagnostic accuracy was different depending on whether the clinician was face to face with the patient (in‐person visual inspection), or looked at an image of the lesion (image‐based visual inspection). Cochrane researchers included 19 studies to answer this question. 
Why is it important to know the diagnostic accuracy of visual examination of skin lesions suspected to be melanomas? 
Not recognising a melanoma when it is present (a false‐negative test result) delays surgery to remove it (excision), risking cancer spreading to other organs in the body and possibly death. Diagnosing a skin lesion (a mole or area of skin with an unusual appearance in comparison with the surrounding skin) as a melanoma when it is not (a false‐positive result) may result in unnecessary surgery, further investigations, and patient anxiety. Visual inspection of suspicious skin lesions by a clinician using the naked eye is usually the first of a series of ‘tests’ to diagnose melanoma. Knowing the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection alone is important to decide whether additional tests, such as a biopsy (removing a part of the lesion for examination under a microscope) are needed to improve accuracy to an acceptable level. 
What did the review study? 
Researchers wanted to find out the diagnostic accuracy of in‐person compared with image‐based visual inspection of suspicious skin lesions. Researchers also wanted to find out whether diagnostic accuracy was improved if doctors used a 'visual inspection checklist' or depending on how experienced in visual inspection they were (level of clinical expertise). They considered the diagnostic accuracy of the first visual inspection of a lesion, for example, by a general practitioner (GP), and of lesions that had been referred for further evaluation, for example, by a dermatologist (doctor specialising in skin problems). 
What are the main results of the review? 
Only 19 studies (17 in‐person studies and 2 image‐based studies) were clear whether the test was the first visual inspection of a lesion or was a visual inspection following referral (for example, when patients are referred by a GP to skin specialists for visual inspection). 
First in‐person visual inspection (3 studies) 
The results of three studies of 1339 suspicious skin lesions suggest that in a group of 1000 lesions, of which 90 (9%) actually are melanoma: 
‐ An estimated 268 will have a visual inspection result indicating melanoma is present. Of these, 185 will not be melanoma and will result in an unnecessary biopsy (false‐positive results). 
‐ An estimated 732 will have a visual inspection result indicating that melanoma is not present. Of these, seven will actually have melanoma and would not be sent for biopsy (false‐negative results). 
Two further studies restricted to 4228 suspicious skin lesions that were all selected to be excised found similar results. 
In‐person visual inspection after referral, all lesions selected to be excised (8 studies) 
The results of eight studies of 5331 suspicious skin lesions suggest that in a group of 1000 lesions, of which 90 (9%) actually are melanoma: 
‐ An estimated 108 will have a visual inspection result indicating melanoma is present, and of these, 39 will not be melanoma and will result in an unnecessary biopsy (false‐positive results). 
‐ Of the 892 lesions with a visual inspection result indicating that melanoma is not present, 21 will actually be melanoma and would not be sent for biopsy (false‐negative results). 
Overall, the number of false‐positive results (diagnosing a skin lesion as a melanoma when it is not) was observed to be higher and the number of false‐negative results (not recognising a melanoma when it is present) lower for first visual inspections of suspicious skin lesions compared to visual inspection following referral. 
Visual inspection of images of suspicious skin lesions (2 studies) 
Accuracy was much lower for visual inspection of images of lesions compared to visual inspection in person. 
Value of visual inspection checklists 
There was no evidence that use of a visual inspection checklist or the level of clinical expertise changed diagnostic accuracy. 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
The majority of included studies diagnosed melanoma by lesion biopsy and confirmed that melanoma was not present by biopsy or by follow‐up over time to make sure the skin lesion remained negative for melanoma. In these studies, biopsy, clinical follow‐up, or specialist clinician diagnosis were the reference standards (means of establishing final diagnoses). Biopsy or follow‐up are likely to have been reliable methods for deciding whether patients really had melanoma. In a few studies, experts diagnosed the absence of melanoma (expert diagnosis), which is less likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether patients really had melanoma. There was lots of variation in the results of the studies in this review and the studies did not always describe fully the methods they used, which made it difficult to assess their reliability. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Thirteen studies were undertaken in Europe (68%), with the remainder undertaken in Asia (n = 1), Oceania (n = 4), and North America (n = 1). Mean age ranged from 30 to 73.6 years (reported in 10 studies). The percentage of individuals with melanoma ranged between 4% and 20% in first visualised lesions and between 1% and 50% in studies of referred lesions. In the majority of studies, the lesions were unlikely to be representative of the range of those seen in practice, for example, only including skin lesions of a certain size or with a specific appearance. In addition, variation in the expertise of clinicians performing visual inspection and in the definition used to decide whether or not melanoma was present across studies makes it unclear as to how visual inspection should be carried out and by whom in order to achieve the accuracy observed in studies. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Error rates from visual inspection are too high for it to be relied upon alone. Although not evaluated in this review, other technologies need to be used to ensure accurate diagnosis of skin cancer. There is considerable variation and uncertainty about the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection alone for the diagnosis of melanoma. There is no evidence to suggest that visual inspection checklists reliably improve the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection, so recommendations cannot be made about when they should be used. Despite the existence of numerous research studies, further, well‐reported studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection with and without visual inspection checklists and by clinicians with different levels of expertise are needed. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
","# Plain Language Summary: How Well Can Doctors Spot Skin Cancer by Looking at the Skin?

## Plain Title
How Well Can Doctors Find Melanoma Skin Cancer by Looking at Skin Spots?

## Rationale

### What is melanoma and why does it matter?
Melanoma is a very dangerous type of skin cancer. It can look like a mole or an unusual spot on the skin. If doctors do not find melanoma early, it can spread to other parts of the body. This can lead to death.

### Why is this study important?
Doctors need to know if they can find melanoma just by looking at the skin. If they miss a melanoma, the patient may not get treatment in time. If they think a normal spot is melanoma, the patient may have surgery they do not need. This can cause worry and harm.

### What happens during a skin check?
When you see a doctor about a skin spot, they first look at it with their eyes. This is called visual inspection. The doctor decides if the spot needs more tests. A biopsy means taking a small piece of skin to look at under a microscope.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors need to know how good visual inspection is at finding melanoma. This helps them decide if more tests are needed. The study looked at whether doctors do better when they see patients in person or look at pictures. It also checked if using a checklist helps doctors be more accurate.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked at 19 past studies. These studies tested how well doctors could find melanoma by looking at skin spots. The researchers wanted to see how many times doctors were right or wrong.

### What did the studies include?
Most studies (17 studies) looked at doctors checking patients in person. Two studies looked at doctors checking pictures of skin spots. Some studies looked at first visits to a family doctor. Other studies looked at visits to skin specialists after a family doctor sent the patient there.

### Who was in these studies?
The studies included people from many countries. Most studies were from Europe. People in the studies were between 30 and 74 years old on average. The studies looked at thousands of skin spots that doctors thought might be melanoma.

### How did researchers know the real answer?
Doctors did a biopsy on most skin spots. They looked at the skin under a microscope. This showed if the spot was really melanoma or not. Some studies watched patients over time to make sure spots stayed normal.

## Results

### What did the study find about first doctor visits?
Three studies looked at first visits to a doctor. Imagine 1,000 skin spots where 90 are really melanoma:
- Doctors would say 268 spots look like melanoma
- Of these 268 spots, 185 would not really be melanoma (wrong answer)
- Doctors would say 732 spots do not look like melanoma
- Of these 732 spots, 7 would really be melanoma (missed cancer)

### What about visits to skin specialists?
Eight studies looked at visits after a family doctor sent patients to a specialist. Again, imagine 1,000 skin spots where 90 are really melanoma:
- Doctors would say 108 spots look like melanoma
- Of these 108 spots, 39 would not really be melanoma (wrong answer)
- Doctors would say 892 spots do not look like melanoma
- Of these 892 spots, 21 would really be melanoma (missed cancer)

### What about looking at pictures?
Two studies looked at doctors checking pictures instead of seeing patients. Doctors made more mistakes when looking at pictures than when seeing patients in person.

### Did checklists help?
Some doctors used checklists when looking at skin spots. The studies found no proof that checklists made doctors more accurate.

### Did doctor experience matter?
The studies looked at doctors with different levels of training. There was no clear proof that more experienced doctors were more accurate.

### What does this mean for patients?
Visual inspection alone makes too many mistakes. Doctors miss some melanomas. They also think some normal spots are melanoma. Other tests are needed to make sure the diagnosis is right. More research is needed to find the best way for doctors to check skin spots.

### How reliable were these results?
The studies used good methods to check if spots were really melanoma. But the studies were very different from each other. This makes it hard to know exactly how accurate visual inspection is. The results may not apply to all patients or all doctors.

10.1002-14651858.CD013196.pub2-pls.txt,"Telehealth technologies for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
Review question 
Do telehealth technologies help improve the health of people who have COPD?
Background 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes a group of lung conditions that cause breathing difficulties. Symptoms include shortness of breath (dyspnoea), coughing, and increased mucus. COPD causes limited airflow in the lungs when breathing out; this can be measured by spirometry (a measure to assess how well the lungs function). The spirometer takes two measurements: volume of air when breathing out forcefully in one second, and total amount of air breathed out. When COPD gets worse over time, this leads to greater symptom severity and can reduce quality of life. Disease progression and sudden flare‐ups (exacerbations) of symptoms can increase someone's risks of hospitalisation and death. Telehealth technologies could improve delivery of health care for people with COPD, which could reduce exacerbations, improve quality of life, and lower rates of hospitalisation. However, it is unclear whether providing telehealth care improves health‐related outcomes for people with COPD. We wanted to explore whether telehealth technologies were helpful for people with COPD. 
What are telehealth technologies? 
Study investigators used a range of telehealth technologies. Some included remote monitoring technology, which requires daily use of a laptop or a tablet with monitoring equipment, with results received by the healthcare professional. Typical monitoring equipment included a stethoscope (to measure blood pressure and heart rate), a pulse oximeter (to measure oxygen levels in the blood), a spirometer (to measure lung function), a thermometer, and other devices. Interventions involved regular phone calls with healthcare professionals for patients to talk about their symptoms and completion of health questionnaires. 
Identifying and selecting studies 
We searched online databases up until April 2020. We searched for studies published worldwide, in any language, at any time. Two review authors looked at lists of studies separately, then agreed on which studies should be included. 
To find the best answer to our question, we looked for studies that recruited people with COPD of any severity. To make the comparison fair, we looked for studies in which investigators compared remote monitoring, remote monitoring plus usual care, and multi‐component treatments. People included in these studies had to have the same random chance (like the flip of a coin) to receive one of these teleheath technologies or usual care. 
Key results 
We found 29 studies (5654 people with moderate to very severe COPD) that were suitable for inclusion in our review. Duration of these studies ranged from 3 to 12 months. 
We did not find any important benefits or harms for patients who were monitored with any of the telehealth technologies when we looked at number of exacerbations, improvement in quality of life, and reduction in breathing distress symptoms, hospitalisations, or death. However, people who were monitored through telehealth technology plus usual care had some reduction in risk of hospital re‐admission. Thus, telehealth technologies that were part of a care package reduced COPD‐related hospital re‐admissions. 
We could not be certain of any harms of stand‐alone remote monitoring. We are also uncertain of any benefits or harms of stand‐alone remote monitoring of patient experiences or reports of breathing distress. 
Quality of evidence 
Currently, no good quality evidence is available. We are very uncertain about evidence for exacerbations, quality of life, dyspnoea symptoms, hospitalisations, deaths, and side effects. However, we are moderately certain about our findings for hospital re‐admissions. 
Conclusion 
We are not clear whether telehealth technologies for monitoring or consultation provide benefit, but we have not found any information on harms. Telehealth could play a role in the care and management of people with COPD. Telehealth as part of multi‐component care packages may provide short‐term benefit for quality of life and hospital re‐admissions. Telehealth in the form of remote monitoring in addition to usual care may reduce the risk of hospital re‐admission. There is little impact on exacerbations, quality of life, and death. Owing to limited information, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. More studies are needed to determine whether telehealth provides any long‐term benefits for people with COPD of varying severity. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Telehealth Technologies for People with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

## Plain Title
Can Remote Health Technology Help People with Lung Disease Called COPD?

## Rationale

**What is COPD?**
COPD is a lung disease that makes it hard to breathe. People with COPD have trouble getting air out of their lungs. They may feel short of breath, cough a lot, and have extra mucus. Over time, COPD can get worse. This means more symptoms and a harder time doing daily tasks.

**Why is COPD a problem?**
When COPD gets worse, people may have sudden flare-ups. These are times when symptoms get much worse very quickly. Flare-ups can send people to the hospital. They can also lead to death. COPD makes life harder and less enjoyable for many people.

**What is telehealth?**
Telehealth means using technology to get health care from home. This can include phone calls with nurses or doctors. It can also mean using devices at home to check your health. The devices send information to your health care team.

**Why study telehealth for COPD?**
Researchers wanted to know if telehealth could help people with COPD. They thought it might reduce flare-ups. It might also help people stay out of the hospital. It could make life better for people with COPD. This study looked at whether telehealth really works for COPD patients.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was not one study. Researchers looked at 29 different studies. They combined the results to find patterns. This helps give better answers than one study alone.

**Who was in these studies?**
The studies included 5,654 people total. All had COPD. Their COPD ranged from moderate to very severe. The studies included both men and women. They included adults of different ages.

**What did people in the studies do?**
Some people used telehealth technology. Others got usual care only. The choice was random, like flipping a coin. This made the comparison fair.

The telehealth tools included:
- Devices to check blood pressure and heart rate
- Devices to check oxygen levels in blood
- Devices to check lung function
- Thermometers
- Regular phone calls with health care workers
- Health questionnaires

**How long did the studies last?**
The studies lasted between 3 and 12 months. People used the telehealth tools during this time.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers looked at several important things:
- Number of flare-ups
- Quality of life
- Breathing problems
- Hospital visits
- Deaths
- Going back to the hospital after being discharged

**Main findings:**
Telehealth did not show major benefits for most things measured. People using telehealth had about the same number of flare-ups as others. Their quality of life was similar. They had similar breathing problems. Hospital visits and deaths were about the same.

However, one finding was different. People who used telehealth plus usual care went back to the hospital less often. This was especially true when telehealth was part of a larger care package.

**Were there any harms?**
The researchers did not find clear evidence of harm from telehealth. But they also could not be certain it was completely safe.

**How good was the evidence?**
Most of the evidence was not very strong. The researchers were not very certain about most findings. They were moderately certain only about hospital readmissions.

**What do these results mean?**
Telehealth might help reduce hospital readmissions when combined with usual care. But it does not seem to help much with other COPD problems. More research is needed to know if telehealth truly helps people with COPD.

**Conclusions from researchers:**
The researchers said we cannot be sure if telehealth helps people with COPD. They did not find proof of harm. Telehealth as part of a full care plan might help in the short term. It might keep people out of the hospital. But more studies are needed. Future studies should look at long-term benefits. They should include people with different levels of COPD severity.

**Important note:**
These findings should be viewed with caution. The evidence was limited. Better quality studies are needed to give clearer answers."

Review question 
Which preventative antibiotic is effective and safe for reducing exacerbations, improving quality of life, and reducing serious side effects in people with COPD? 
What is COPD? 
COPD is a lung condition that can cause long‐term breathing problems. Symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, and sputum production. Flare‐ups (so‐called exacerbations) can be triggered by infection or inflammation, causing worsening symptoms and lung damage. Frequent exacerbations can lead to reduced quality of life and can increase the risk of death. 
Why did we do this review? 
We wanted to find out if one type of preventative antibiotic was better than another in reducing exacerbations, improving quality of life, and reducing side effects. We did this by using information from two previous reviews and comparing different antibiotics with each other, and with a control treatment (called placebo), by creating networks. As information was limited, the networks allowed us to combine information and determine the best preventative antibiotics by ranking them in order of ability to reduce exacerbations, improve quality of life, and reduce serious side effects. 
What evidence did we find? 
We tested three types of antibiotics: macrolides, quinolones, and tetracyclines. Macrolides were better in reducing exacerbations compared to control treatment. There was no clear difference in exacerbations when quinolone or tetracycline was compared with a control treatment. Tetracyclines were ranked lower than placebo in reducing exacerbations. We used the data for each antibiotic group to rank antibiotic groups in order of their ability to reduce exacerbations. We found that macrolides ranked first, followed by quinolones (second). Tetracyclines were ranked fourth and were not better than control treatment (ranked third). 
Macrolides improved quality of life compared with control treatment. Quinolones did not appear to impact quality of life, and tetracyclines may have been associated with worsening quality of life compared to control treatment. 
Macrolides were more effective in reducing serious unwanted events. There was no clear benefit for serious unwanted events with quinolone, tetracycline, or combined macrolide plus tetracycline compared with control treatment. 
We could not clearly show benefit or harm of preventative antibiotic use for microbial resistance. 
Quality of the evidence 
We did not find any concerns about the ways in which studies were carried out, except that for some studies, people collecting the information knew (1) which patient was included in which treatment group, and (2) patient results when treatments were completed. Overall, the numerical information was robust and was unlikely to be influenced by differences noted between individual studies. 
Conclusion 
We found that exacerbations were reduced, quality of life was improved, and unwanted events were fewer with macrolides compared with control treatment. We could not determine whether quinolones or tetracyclines were of benefit compared with control treatment. Macrolides were ranked highest, followed by quinolones, which ranked second. Tetracyclines were no better than control treatment (ranked fourth and third, respectively). Although these NMAs show some benefit of using macrolides, they are based on a limited number of studies, and concerns remain about antibiotic resistance with long‐term use of antibiotics. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Antibiotics to Prevent Flare-Ups in People with COPD

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Antibiotics to Prevent Breathing Flare-Ups in People with COPD

## Rationale

**What is COPD?**
COPD is a lung disease that makes it hard to breathe. People with COPD often feel short of breath. They may cough a lot and bring up mucus. These problems can last a long time.

**What are flare-ups?**
People with COPD can have flare-ups. These are also called attacks. During a flare-up, breathing gets much worse. Flare-ups happen when germs infect the lungs or when the lungs get inflamed. Each flare-up can damage the lungs more. People who have many flare-ups may feel worse overall. They may not be able to do daily tasks. Flare-ups can also increase the risk of death.

**Why did researchers do this study?**
Doctors sometimes give antibiotics to people with COPD. The goal is to prevent flare-ups before they start. These are called preventative antibiotics. Researchers wanted to know which type of antibiotic works best. They wanted to find out which ones:
- Reduce flare-ups the most
- Help people feel better in daily life
- Cause fewer harmful side effects

**Why might antibiotics help?**
Antibiotics kill germs that can cause lung infections. By taking antibiotics regularly, people might have fewer infections. This could mean fewer flare-ups and less lung damage.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was not a single study. Researchers looked at many past studies together. They compared three types of antibiotics:
- Macrolides
- Quinolones
- Tetracyclines

They also compared these antibiotics to placebo. A placebo is a fake treatment with no medicine. This helps show if the real medicine works.

**What made this study special?**
Researchers used a network method. This let them compare all the antibiotics to each other. They could then rank them from best to worst.

**Who was in these studies?**
The studies included adults with COPD. Both men and women took part. The studies looked at people of different ages.

**How long did the studies last?**
The length of time varied across different studies. People took the antibiotics for several months.

## Results

**What did researchers find about flare-ups?**
Macrolides worked better than placebo at reducing flare-ups. Quinolones and tetracyclines did not clearly reduce flare-ups. When researchers ranked all the antibiotics:
- Macrolides ranked first (best)
- Quinolones ranked second
- Placebo ranked third
- Tetracyclines ranked fourth (worst)

This means macrolides were the most helpful. Tetracyclines were not better than taking no antibiotic at all.

**What about quality of life?**
Quality of life means how well people feel day to day. Macrolides helped people feel better in their daily lives. Quinolones did not seem to change quality of life. Tetracyclines may have made quality of life worse.

**What about side effects?**
All medicines can cause unwanted effects. Researchers looked at serious harmful events. Macrolides caused fewer serious problems than placebo. The other antibiotics did not show clear benefits for reducing serious side effects.

**What about germ resistance?**
When people take antibiotics for a long time, germs can become resistant. This means the antibiotics stop working. Researchers could not clearly show if these antibiotics caused more resistance. This is still a concern.

**How good was the evidence?**
Most studies were done well. In some studies, the people collecting information knew which treatment each person got. This could affect results. But overall, the numbers were reliable.

**What do these results mean?**
Macrolides appear to be the best choice for preventing flare-ups in people with COPD. They reduce flare-ups, improve daily life, and cause fewer serious problems. Quinolones might help some, but the evidence is less clear. Tetracyclines do not appear helpful.

**Important notes:**
These findings are based on a small number of studies. Doctors still worry about antibiotic resistance with long-term use. People with COPD should talk to their doctor. Together, they can decide if preventative antibiotics are right for them."

","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Can Stem Cell Treatment Help Premature Babies Who Have Brain Bleeding?

## Rationale

### What is the health problem?

Some babies are born too early. Doctors call these babies ""preterm."" Babies born before 28 weeks are at highest risk for problems. These very early babies sometimes get bleeding in their brain.

### What happens to babies with brain bleeding?

Some babies with mild bleeding get better on their own. They may have no problems or only small problems as they grow. Other babies have more serious bleeding. These babies may die or have problems later in life. Some may develop cerebral palsy. This means they have trouble moving their body. Others may have trouble learning or thinking. These problems can last their whole life.

### Why was this study needed?

Right now, doctors have no way to stop or treat brain bleeding in premature babies. Researchers wanted to know if a new treatment might help. This treatment is called stem cell therapy.

### What is stem cell therapy?

Stem cells are special cells that can help fix damaged parts of the body. Doctors give these cells to the baby, often through a shot. The stem cells can come from different places. They might come from cord blood, bone marrow, or other body parts. They can come from humans or animals. Once inside the baby, these cells travel to the brain. They try to repair the brain cells damaged by bleeding.

### What did researchers want to learn?

Researchers wanted to know if stem cell therapy could help premature babies with brain bleeding live longer. They also wanted to know if it could help babies grow and develop better over time.

## Trial Design

### How did researchers look for answers?

The researchers searched for studies done on this topic. They looked for studies up to January 7, 2019. They wanted to find studies that tested stem cell therapy in premature babies with brain bleeding.

### What kind of studies did they look for?

They looked for studies that compared babies who got stem cell therapy to babies who did not. They wanted studies that followed babies over time. This would show if the treatment helped babies survive and develop normally.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

The researchers found five studies about stem cell therapy for brain bleeding in premature babies. However, they could not use any of these studies. All five studies were ""phase 1"" studies. These are very early studies. They only test if a treatment is safe. They use very few patients. They do not test if a treatment actually works.

### What does this mean?

Because all the studies were phase 1 studies, the researchers could not answer their question. They could not tell if stem cell therapy helps premature babies with brain bleeding. They could not tell if it helps babies live longer. They could not tell if it helps babies develop better.

### What are the main conclusions?

Right now, there is no good evidence about stem cell therapy for brain bleeding in premature babies. More research is needed. Future studies need to test whether stem cell therapy actually works. They need to include more babies. They need to follow babies for a long time. Only then can doctors know if this treatment is helpful.

### What does this mean for families?

Families of premature babies with brain bleeding still have limited treatment options. Stem cell therapy is still being studied. It is not ready to use as a standard treatment. More research must be done first. Families should talk to their doctors about all available options for their baby."

","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Can Stem Cell Treatment Help Babies Whose Brains Were Harmed by Low Oxygen at Birth?

## Rationale

### What is the health problem?

Some babies do not get enough oxygen during birth. This can hurt their brain. Doctors call this ""poor brain oxygenation at birth.""

### What happens to these babies?

Babies with mild brain harm may get better on their own. They may have only small problems later.

Babies with more serious brain harm may die. Or they may have problems as they grow up. These problems can include:
- Trouble moving their body (called cerebral palsy)
- Trouble learning and thinking
- Other health issues

### What treatment exists now?

Right now, doctors can only use cooling to treat these babies. They cool the baby's body to help protect the brain.

### What is stem cell treatment?

Stem cells are special cells that can help fix damaged parts of the body. Doctors give these cells to the baby, often through a shot. The stem cells can come from:
- Cord blood (blood from the umbilical cord)
- Bone marrow (the soft part inside bones)
- Other parts of the body

The stem cells may come from humans or animals. These cells travel to the brain. They work to repair brain cells that were hurt by low oxygen.

### Why was this study needed?

Doctors wanted to know if stem cell treatment could help these babies. They wanted to see if it could:
- Save more babies' lives
- Help babies grow and develop better over time

## Trial Design

### How did researchers look for answers?

The researchers searched for studies done by other doctors. They looked for studies that tested stem cell treatment in newborn babies. These babies had brain harm from low oxygen at birth.

They searched through June 2020.

### What did they find?

The researchers found three studies. But they could not use any of them. These studies were very early tests (called phase 1 studies). They were designed to check if the treatment was safe. They were not designed to answer whether stem cell treatment works.

The researchers also found 15 studies that are still going on. These studies have not finished yet.

## Results

### What were the main results?

The researchers could not include any finished studies in their review. This means they cannot yet answer the question: Does stem cell treatment help babies whose brains were harmed by low oxygen at birth?

### What does this mean?

We still do not know if stem cell treatment works for these babies. We need to wait for more studies to finish.

The 15 ongoing studies may give us answers in the future. When these studies are done, we will learn more about:
- Whether stem cell treatment saves lives
- Whether it helps babies develop better
- Whether it is safe

### What should happen next?

Doctors and researchers need to finish the ongoing studies. Only then can we know if stem cell treatment should be used for babies with brain harm from low oxygen at birth.

Right now, cooling remains the only proven treatment for these babies.

---

**Note:** This review was done by researchers who looked at all available studies. They followed strict rules to make sure their findings were accurate. They only wanted to include studies that could truly answer whether stem cell treatment works. Since no studies met their standards yet, we must wait for better research to be completed."
10.1002-14651858.CD013206.pub2-pls.txt,"Which oral or injected medicines work best to treat moderate to severe eczema?
Why this question is important 
Eczema is a persistent condition that causes dry, cracked, and itchy skin. People with mild eczema have small patches of dry skin, and people with moderate eczema have larger, redder, or swollen areas of skin. People with severe eczema have red crusts and broken skin (which may ooze fluid) that develop all over the body. 
Although there is currently no cure for eczema, treatments that aim to relieve symptoms are available. Usually, the first treatment option is to apply creams, ointments, or liquids to the affected skin. If this does not work, it is possible to take oral or injected (systemic) medicines that work throughout the body. 
Many systemic medicines are available for eczema. To help people decide which one is most appropriate for managing their symptoms, we reviewed the evidence on benefits and risks of different systemic medicines for people with moderate or severe eczema. We particularly wanted to find out: 
• whether some medicines were more likely than others to have an important positive effect on symptoms (defined as either at least a 75% improvement on the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), or improvement on the Patient‐Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM)—two scales that are used by clinicians to evaluate changes in eczema symptoms); and 
• whether some medicines are associated with more serious unwanted events, including infection, than others. 
How we identified and assessed the evidence 
First, we searched the medical literature for randomised controlled studies (studies where people are randomly divided into different treatment groups) because these studies provide the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We then compared study results and summarised the evidence from all studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, the size of studies, and the consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate, or high certainty. 
What we found 
We found 74 studies that involved a total of 8177 people with moderate to severe eczema. Studies lasted between 2 weeks and 60 months. Treatments received varied from a single, one‐off dose to weekly doses for 60 months. These studies evaluated 29 different medicines by comparing them to a placebo (fake treatment) or to another medicine, or by comparing different doses of the same medicine. The medicine that was studied most frequently was dupilumab (12 studies), a laboratory‐made version of a protein, which blocks parts of the immune system involved in causing eczema. 
Dupilumab versus placebo 
High‐certainty evidence shows that, compared to a placebo or other laboratory‐made proteins, dupilumab improves the symptoms of people with moderate to severe eczema in the short term (within 16 weeks of treatment). It is unclear whether this improvement is sustained after 16 weeks because no studies have looked at changes in POEM scores beyond that time, and because the evidence from studies that measured EASI scores was of very low certainty. Dupilumab may be associated with fewer serious unwanted events than placebo (low‐certainty evidence). 
Other systemic medicines versus placebo 
Evidence on the benefits and risks of other systemic medicines compared to placebo is limited because no studies have measured their effects on symptom improvement or serious unwanted effects, or because the certainty of the evidence is low or very low. 
Comparing different systemic medicines with one another 
Reviewers found too few studies that compared different systemic medicines against one another to determine which worked best for people with moderate to severe eczema. 
What this means 
Evidence shows that, compared to placebo, dupilumab improves the symptoms of people with moderate to severe eczema within 16 weeks of treatment and may be associated with fewer serious unwanted events. 
Reviewers found too few robust studies to conclude whether dupilumab improves symptoms beyond 16 weeks, or whether this medicine works better than older systemic medicines. Future studies need to compare different systemic treatments beyond 16 weeks in people with moderate to severe eczema. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to August 2019.

## Plain Title

Comparing Oral and Injected Medicines for People with Moderate to Severe Eczema

## Rationale

**What is eczema and why does it matter?**

Eczema is a long-lasting skin condition. It makes skin dry, cracked, and itchy. People with mild eczema have small dry patches. People with moderate eczema have larger, redder, or swollen areas. People with severe eczema have red crusts and broken skin all over their body. The broken skin may leak fluid.

**Why was this study needed?**

There is no cure for eczema right now. But treatments can help with symptoms. Most people first try creams or ointments on their skin. If these do not work, they can try medicines that go inside the body. These are called systemic medicines. They can be pills or shots.

Many different systemic medicines exist for eczema. Doctors and patients need to know which ones work best. They also need to know which ones are safest.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to find out two main things:
- Which medicines help symptoms the most?
- Which medicines cause the fewest serious side effects?

They looked at how much symptoms improved. They used two measurement scales. One is called EASI. The other is called POEM. Doctors use these scales to track changes in eczema.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review of many studies. Researchers looked at 74 different studies. These studies included 8,177 people total. All of these people had moderate to severe eczema.

The studies tested 29 different medicines. Some studies compared a medicine to a fake treatment (called a placebo). Other studies compared two different medicines. Some studies compared different doses of the same medicine.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included adults and children with moderate to severe eczema. Both men and women were included.

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies lasted different amounts of time. The shortest study was 2 weeks. The longest study was 60 months (5 years). People received treatments in different ways. Some got a single dose one time. Others got weekly doses for up to 60 months.

**Which medicine was studied most?**

The medicine studied most often was dupilumab. Twelve studies looked at this medicine. Dupilumab is a lab-made protein. It blocks parts of the immune system that cause eczema.

## Results

**What did researchers find about dupilumab?**

Dupilumab works better than fake treatment for moderate to severe eczema. This finding is very reliable (high-certainty evidence). Dupilumab improves symptoms within 16 weeks of treatment.

Dupilumab may cause fewer serious side effects than fake treatment. This finding is fairly reliable (low-certainty evidence).

Researchers do not know if dupilumab keeps working after 16 weeks. Not enough studies looked at this question. The evidence available was not reliable enough.

**What about other medicines?**

Researchers found limited information about other systemic medicines. Many studies did not measure symptom improvement. Many did not track serious side effects. When studies did measure these things, the evidence was not reliable enough to draw conclusions.

**Can we compare different medicines to each other?**

No, not yet. Too few studies compared different systemic medicines directly. Researchers cannot say which medicine works best.

**What does this mean for patients?**

Dupilumab improves eczema symptoms within 16 weeks. It may be safer than fake treatment. This is good news for people with moderate to severe eczema.

However, more research is needed. We need to know if dupilumab keeps working after 16 weeks. We need to know how dupilumab compares to older medicines.

**What research is needed next?**

Future studies should compare different systemic medicines directly. These studies should last longer than 16 weeks. They should include people with moderate to severe eczema.

**How current is this information?**

This review includes studies published up to August 2019."

Why is improving the diagnosis of HIV infection important? 
It is estimated that 1.5 million infants are still exposed to HIV every year. If left untreated, about 50% to 60% of HIV‐infected infants will die by the age of two years. Children infected before birth are especially at high risk of death. HIV is incurable; however, there are medications that suppress HIV, known as antiretroviral drugs (ART). When HIV is detected early, severe illness and death from HIV‐related infections can be prevented by taking this medication. A test that detects HIV viral genetic molecules quickly and accurately at or near the patient's side (point‐of‐care) therefore can increase access to early appropriate treatment and minimize missing treatments in those whose HIV remains undetected. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To determine the accuracy of molecular point‐of‐care tests for detecting the main types of HIV infection (HIV‐1/HIV‐2) in infants and children aged 18 months or less. 
What was studied in this review? 
Published reports of molecular point‐of‐care tests with results measured against laboratory viral‐based tests (benchmark). 
What are the main results of this review? 
Twelve studies which completed 15 evaluations involving 15,120 participants compared molecular point‐of‐care tests for diagnosing HIV infection. 
What are the strengths and limitations of this review? 
The review included sufficient studies and participants. All studies were conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa, making the results highly applicable for use in communities where the disease is regularly found and where disease control programmes are often targeted. However, one in three included evaluations of the molecular point‐of‐care tests were conducted in a laboratory setting and not near the patient but there was no difference in the test accuracy between settings. 
To whom do the results of this review apply? 
Infants and children aged 18 months or less who were exposed to HIV infection.
What are the implications of this review? 
In theory, for a population of 1000 children aged 18 months or less where 100 have HIV infection, 100 children will be positive with the molecular point‐of‐care test, of which one will not have the infection (false‐positive result), and 900 will be negative with the molecular point‐of‐care test, of which one will indeed have the infection (false‐negative result).

","# Plain Language Summary: Testing Babies and Young Children for HIV at the Point of Care

## Plain Title
Quick HIV Tests Done Near the Patient for Babies and Young Children

## Rationale

**What is HIV and why is it a problem for babies?**

HIV is a virus that attacks the body. About 1.5 million babies are exposed to HIV each year. Without treatment, half of babies born with HIV will die before age two. Babies who get HIV before birth face the highest risk of death.

**Why is early testing important?**

HIV cannot be cured. But there are drugs that can control the virus. These drugs are called antiretroviral drugs or ART. When doctors find HIV early, they can start treatment right away. This treatment stops babies from getting very sick or dying.

**What is a point-of-care test?**

A point-of-care test is done at or near where the patient is. It gives results quickly. This means doctors can start treatment faster. It also helps make sure no baby with HIV gets missed.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know how well these quick tests work. They needed to check if the tests could find HIV correctly in babies and young children. Good tests help more babies get the treatment they need.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at other studies that had already been done. They gathered information from 12 studies. These studies included 15 different test checks. In total, 15,120 babies and young children were tested.

**Who was in these studies?**

All children were 18 months old or younger. All had been exposed to HIV. This means the virus could have passed to them from their mothers.

**Where were these studies done?**

All studies took place in sub-Saharan Africa. This is where most babies with HIV live. This makes the results very useful for the places that need them most.

**How did researchers check if the tests worked?**

They compared the quick point-of-care tests to lab tests. Lab tests are the standard way to check for HIV. They are very accurate but take longer to get results.

**What about test location?**

Some tests were done right near patients. Others were done in labs. Researchers checked if location made a difference. It did not. The tests worked the same in both places.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The quick point-of-care tests worked very well. They found almost all babies who had HIV. They also correctly identified almost all babies who did not have HIV.

**How accurate were the tests?**

Here is an easy way to understand the results. Imagine 1,000 babies get tested. Of these babies, 100 actually have HIV.

The test will show:
- 100 babies test positive for HIV
- Of these 100, only 1 baby does not actually have HIV (wrong result)
- 900 babies test negative for HIV  
- Of these 900, only 1 baby actually has HIV (missed case)

**What does this mean for patients?**

These tests are very good at finding HIV in babies. They rarely miss a baby who has HIV. They also rarely say a baby has HIV when they do not.

**Why is this important?**

Quick and accurate tests mean babies can start treatment faster. This saves lives. It also helps in places where lab tests are hard to get.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

Point-of-care tests for HIV work very well in babies and young children. They can be used near the patient. They give results quickly. They help doctors start life-saving treatment right away.

These tests are especially helpful in Africa. This is where most babies with HIV live. The tests can reach more babies in more places.

**How current is this information?**

This review includes all studies published up to February 2, 2021."

High virus levels indicate that the medications are failing to suppress the virus, a condition known as ART treatment failure, which has a risk of severe illness and death.

Point‐of‐care tests for viral load detection with results measured against central laboratory tests (reference test). We included all forms of tests with POC platforms for VL regardless of the healthcare facility in which the test was conducted. 
What are the main results in this review? 
Fourteen studies that completed 20 evaluations involving 8659 participants compared molecular POC tests for diagnosing high virus levels at the clinically recommended positivity threshold of ≥ 1000 copies/mL. 
What are the strengths and limitations of this review? 
The review included sufficient studies done on samples from PLHIV retrieved from routine HIV/AIDS care centres or health facilities, but it was unclear if all included participants were on ART. Also, none of the included tests was a true POC test conducted at the patient's side: half of the included studies (n = 10) evaluated POC tests in onsite laboratories near the patient, and the other half were tests with POC platforms evaluated in a central or reference laboratory (n = 10). 
To whom do the results of this review apply? 
PLHIV with suspected high viral loads attending healthcare facilities.
What are the implications of this review? 
In theory, for a population of 1000 PLHIV where 100 have high virus levels, 136 people would receive a positive result with the molecular POC test; of these, 39 will not have high viral levels (false‐positive result) and would be incorrectly identified as not responding to ART treatment, possibly leading to unnecessary testing or further treatment; and 864 would receive a negative test result with the molecular POC test; of these, three will actually have high virus levels (false‐negative result) and would be missed whilst failing ART treatment. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence is current to 23 November 2020.

## Plain Title
Testing HIV Virus Levels Quickly at Health Clinics: How Well Do These Tests Work?

## Rationale

**What is HIV and why does virus level matter?**

HIV is a virus that attacks the body's defense system. People living with HIV take daily medicines called antiretroviral therapy or ART. These medicines work to keep the virus under control.

Doctors need to check if the medicines are working. They do this by measuring how much virus is in a person's blood. This is called viral load.

**Why is this study needed?**

Sometimes the medicines stop working well. When this happens, the virus level goes up. A high virus level means the person needs different medicines right away. If not treated, high virus levels can make people very sick.

Normally, blood samples go to a big lab far away. Results can take weeks. Quick tests done at the clinic could give results the same day. This means people could start new medicines faster.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know if quick tests done at clinics work as well as tests done at big labs. They wanted to see if these quick tests could correctly find people with high virus levels.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a single study. Researchers looked at 14 different studies done by other scientists. They combined all the results together.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included 8,659 people living with HIV. These people were getting care at health clinics. Most were taking HIV medicines. The studies did not always say how old people were or if they were men or women.

**What did the studies test?**

The studies tested quick tests that measure virus levels. Doctors took blood samples from people at clinics. They tested the blood using quick tests. Then they compared results to tests done at big labs.

The quick tests looked for high virus levels. High means 1,000 copies of virus or more in each drop of blood.

**Where were the tests done?**

Half the studies did quick tests in small labs at the clinic. The other half tested the quick test machines in big central labs. None of the tests were done right at the patient's bedside.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The quick tests work fairly well but are not perfect. Here is what would happen if 1,000 people living with HIV got tested:

- About 100 of these people actually have high virus levels
- The quick test would find 97 of these 100 people (this is good)
- But the test would miss 3 people who have high virus levels (this is bad)

The test would also give wrong results to some people:

- 39 people would test positive but do not actually have high virus levels
- These people might get worried or get tests they do not need
- They might even change medicines when they do not need to

**What does this mean for patients?**

Quick tests at clinics can help find most people with high virus levels. People can get results the same day instead of waiting weeks. This means they can start new medicines faster.

But the tests are not perfect. A few people with high virus levels will be missed. Some people will get wrong positive results.

**What do the researchers conclude?**

Quick tests done at clinics can help doctors find high virus levels faster. This could help people living with HIV get better treatment sooner. But doctors should know these tests can make mistakes. They may need to do more tests to be sure.

More research is needed on tests done right at the patient's side, not just in clinic labs."

What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out which drugs are most effective for maintaining remission in people with Crohn's disease who have undergone surgery to achieve remission. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. We examined these studies using a method known as network meta‐analysis (NMA) in order to compare and rank all the treatments in terms of clinical relapse, endoscopic relapse and safety. 
What was studied in the review? 
Crohn's disease is a chronic disease of the gut. It is known to change from periods when people experience a flare‐up of the disease (relapse) to periods of good health (remission). Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhoea and weight loss. People with Crohn's disease may undergo surgery to remove diseased parts of their gut and achieve remission. However, their symptoms return after a while. Different drugs can be given to ensure that people with Crohn's disease remain in remission for as long as possible. These drugs include mesalazine, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and adalimumab, amongst others. Whilst these drugs have been known to reduce inflammation (pain and swelling) in the gut, side effects can occur with their use. We attempted to find out which treatments are the safest and most effective for maintaining remission in people with Crohn's disease after surgery. 
How up‐to‐date is the review? 
We searched for studies published up to 15 January 2019.
What are the main results of the review? 
We included 35 relevant trials, which were published between 1976 and 2018. The studies included a total of 3249 participants who were mostly adults. Our NMA included 26 studies (2581 participants) and compared nine groups of treatments such as 5‐aminosalicylic acid, adalimumab, antibiotics, budesonide, infliximab, probiotics, purine analogues, sulfasalazine, and a combination of sulfasalazine and prednisolone, which are used in preventing relapse after surgery in people with Crohn's disease. Adalimumab may reduce the chance of clinical relapse compared with placebo (dummy treatment). 5‐aminosalicylic acid probably reduces the chance of clinical relapse compared with placebo. Budesonide may not be effective in preventing clinical relapse. The entire network evidence is of low certainty due to the small number of participants included in the studies and high risk of bias. This means that are confidence in these results is limited. Research to understand the effect of the treatments on endoscopic relapse and safety was limited, however cases of pancreatitis and leukopenia were reported in participants who received purine analogues. 
Key messages 
We uncertain about which treatments are most effective in preventing postoperative relapse in Crohn's disease. Alhough there is limited research on the harms (side effects) of these treatments, there were reported instances of pancreatitis and leukopenia in participants who received purine analogues. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
What medicines work best to keep Crohn's disease under control after surgery?

## Rationale

**What is Crohn's disease and why does it matter?**

Crohn's disease is a long-term illness that affects the gut. People with this disease go through good times and bad times. During bad times (called flare-ups), they have belly pain, loose stools, and lose weight. During good times (called remission), they feel healthy.

Some people with Crohn's disease need surgery. Doctors remove the damaged parts of the gut. This helps people feel better for a while. But the symptoms often come back later.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors want to find medicines that help people stay healthy longer after surgery. Several types of medicines might work. These include mesalazine, antibiotics, steroids, and adalimumab. These medicines can reduce pain and swelling in the gut. But they can also cause side effects.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to find out which medicine works best. They also wanted to know which medicines are safest. This would help doctors choose the right treatment for their patients.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a single study. Instead, researchers looked at 35 different studies done by other scientists. These studies were published between 1976 and 2018. The researchers searched for all studies up to January 15, 2019.

**Who was in these studies?**

A total of 3,249 people took part in all the studies. Most were adults with Crohn's disease who had surgery.

**What did the researchers compare?**

The researchers compared nine different treatments. These included:
- 5-aminosalicylic acid
- Adalimumab
- Antibiotics
- Budesonide
- Infliximab
- Probiotics
- Purine analogues
- Sulfasalazine
- Sulfasalazine combined with prednisolone

They compared these medicines to dummy pills (called placebo). They used a special method to compare all treatments at once.

**What did researchers measure?**

They looked at how many people had their symptoms come back. They also checked for side effects.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

Adalimumab may help keep symptoms away better than dummy pills. 5-aminosalicylic acid probably also helps keep symptoms away. Budesonide may not work well to prevent symptoms from coming back.

**What about safety?**

There was not much information about side effects. However, some people who took purine analogues had problems. These included pancreatitis (swelling of an organ that helps digest food) and leukopenia (low white blood cell count).

**How strong are these findings?**

The researchers are not very confident in these results. This is because:
- The studies included only small numbers of people
- Some studies were not well designed
- There was not enough information about all the treatments

**What does this mean?**

We still do not know for sure which medicine works best. More research is needed. Doctors and patients should talk about the possible benefits and risks of each treatment.

**Why is this important?**

Finding the right medicine could help people with Crohn's disease stay healthy longer after surgery. This would mean less pain, fewer symptoms, and a better quality of life. But we need better studies to know which treatment is truly best."
10.1002-14651858.CD013212.pub2-pls.txt,"Screening strategies for hypertension
Review question 
What effects do the different ways of screening for hypertension (mass, targeted, or opportunistic) have in decreasing illness and death? 
Background 
Hypertension is a long‐term non‐communicable disease (NCD), also known as high, raised, or elevated blood pressure. Blood pressure is expressed by two measurements (systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) pressures), which are the maximum and minimum pressures. High blood pressure is generally diagnosed when resting blood pressure is persistently at SBP ≥ 130/140 millimetres mercury (mmHg) or at DBP ≥ 80/90 mmHg for adults. 
Even though blood pressure in the arteries is continuously raised, in many cases, high blood pressure does not cause symptoms. Nonetheless, hypertension can increase the risk for heart failure, stroke, vision loss, and chronic kidney disease, and so on, in the long term. People who have unhealthy diets, consume harmful amounts of alcohol and/or tobacco, and are physically inactive are at higher risk of hypertension. 
Early detection, adequate treatment, and good control of high blood pressure can lower the risk of complications associated with hypertension. Although early detection through screening of hypertension has the potential to contain health‐related costs, reducing the burden of hypertension will to some extent involve addressing behavioural and socioeconomic risk factors (such as income, occupation, and level of education). Therefore, it is unclear whether early detection of mild hypertension can positively impact health‐related costs in the long term and improve health outcomes by reducing the need for hospitalisation and management of hypertension‐related complications, which can be severe. 
Review methods 
We searched various electronic databases on this topic until 9 April 2020. We searched for studies written in any language, whether published or not. We planned to include studies that compared one type of screening strategy for hypertension versus no screening strategy, that is, mass screening versus no screening, targeted screening versus no screening, and opportunistic screening versus no screening. We were interested in studies in which participants were healthy adolescents, adults, and elderly people, and in which researchers measured clinical outcomes, health system outcomes, and adverse events. 
Key results 
We found no studies that met the criteria described above.
Quality of the evidence 
High‐certainty evidence that can tell us whether mass, targeted, or opportunistic screening strategies are effective for reducing illness and death associated with hypertension is lacking. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Do Different Ways of Checking People for High Blood Pressure Help Prevent Illness and Death?

## Rationale

**What is high blood pressure?**

High blood pressure is also called hypertension. Your blood pressure has two numbers. The top number is called systolic. The bottom number is called diastolic. Doctors measure blood pressure in units called mmHg. You have high blood pressure when your numbers stay at 130/140 or higher for the top number. Or when the bottom number stays at 80/90 or higher.

**Why is high blood pressure a problem?**

Many people with high blood pressure feel fine. They have no symptoms. But over time, high blood pressure can harm your body. It can cause:
- Heart failure
- Stroke
- Vision loss
- Kidney disease

**Who gets high blood pressure?**

Some people have higher risk. This includes people who:
- Eat unhealthy foods
- Drink too much alcohol
- Use tobacco
- Do not exercise enough
- Have lower income or less education

**Why did researchers want to do this study?**

Finding high blood pressure early can help. When doctors find it early, they can treat it. Good treatment can lower the risk of health problems. This might also save money on health care costs.

But researchers were not sure if checking people early really helps. They wanted to know if different ways of checking for high blood pressure work. They wanted to see if checking people could prevent illness and death.

**What are the different ways to check for high blood pressure?**

There are three main ways:
- Mass screening: Check everyone in a group
- Targeted screening: Check only people at high risk
- Opportunistic screening: Check people when they visit the doctor for other reasons

## Trial Design

**How did researchers look for answers?**

The researchers did not do a new study. Instead, they searched for studies that other scientists had already done. They looked in many medical databases. They searched until April 9, 2020.

**What kind of studies did they want to find?**

They wanted studies that compared screening to no screening. They looked for studies with:
- Healthy teenagers, adults, and older people
- Different screening methods tested against no screening
- Results about illness, death, and health care use

They searched for studies in any language. They looked for both published and unpublished studies.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found no studies that met their needs. Not a single study compared screening for high blood pressure to no screening in the way they needed.

**What does this mean?**

We do not have good evidence to answer the question. We cannot say if mass screening works better than no screening. We cannot say if targeted screening works. We cannot say if opportunistic screening helps prevent illness and death.

**What is the quality of the evidence?**

There is no high-quality evidence available. Scientists need to do more research. We need studies that test if screening for high blood pressure saves lives. We need to know if screening prevents illness.

**What are the conclusions?**

Right now, we do not know which screening method works best. We do not know if screening helps at all. More research is needed to answer these important questions.

This matters because high blood pressure affects many people. Finding the best way to check for it could help millions of people stay healthy. But first, scientists need to do the right studies."
10.1002-14651858.CD013217.pub2-pls.txt,"Non‐pharmacological care for opioid withdrawal in newborns
Review question 
Do one or more specific non‐pharmacological (treatments other than medicines) care practices benefit newborns with opioid withdrawal after birth? 
Background 
Newborns of mothers who take opioids during pregnancy often experience symptoms of withdrawal after delivery, such as high‐pitched cry, tremors, and high tone. Non‐pharmacological care is the first treatment for symptoms of withdrawal. If symptoms worsen despite non‐pharmacological care, a medication such as morphine, methadone, or buprenorphine is the second treatment to reduce symptoms. Though non‐pharmacological care is the first approach to symptom management, it is not the same at every hospital. We wanted to discover whether one or more non‐pharmacological care practices benefit newborns with opioid withdrawal after birth. 
Study characteristics 
We looked at randomized controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) of opioid‐exposed newborns treated with one or more non‐pharmacological care practice. Non‐pharmacological care practices include changes to the environment to reduce stimulation or provide soothing, changes to feeding frequency or type, changes that increase maternal care of the newborn or maternal wellness, and multiple changes such as occur in a new site or system of care. Search is up to date as of October 2019. 
Key results 
This review included six RCTs that enrolled 353 opioid‐exposed newborns. The studies were published between 1975 and 2018. We also identified seven ongoing studies that may qualify for inclusion at review update when complete. 
Of the six RCTs, four assessed changes to the environment to reduce stimulation or provide soothing. These studies examined the effect of a mechanical rocking bed, prone positioning (lying on tummy), non‐oscillating waterbed, and a low‐stimulation nursery. We are uncertain whether modifying environmental stimulation is associated with length of hospitalization based on one study with 30 infants. Modifying environmental stimulation may be associated with little or no difference in use of pharmacological treatment based on three studies with 92 infants. We are uncertain whether modifying environmental stimulation is associated with weight nadir (lowest weight recorded during birth hospitalization) based on one study with 194 infants. 
One study assessed a change to the feeding type comparing higher‐calorie formula to standard‐calorie formula. We are uncertain whether feeding practices are associated with use of medicines, days to regain birth weight, or weight nadir based on one study with 46 infants. 
One study assessed changes to support the mother with tailored breastfeeding support. We are uncertain whether support of the mother‐infant dyad is associated with length of hospitalization, use of medicines, or neonatal intensive care unit admission based on one study with 14 infants. 
Many potential important effects were not reported, and others were not reported in all studies. 
Quality of evidence 
We are uncertain whether one or more specific non‐pharmacological care practices benefit newborns with opioid withdrawal after birth. The quality of evidence for all outcomes is very low to low and provides limited information to inform individual non‐pharmacological care practices or combinations of non‐pharmacological care practices. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Non-Medicine Care for Newborns Going Through Opioid Withdrawal

## Plain Title
Do Non-Medicine Treatments Help Newborns Who Are Withdrawing from Opioids?

## Rationale

### What is the health problem?
Some mothers take opioid drugs during pregnancy. Opioids are strong pain medicines. When babies are born to these mothers, they often have withdrawal symptoms. This means their bodies are used to the opioid and react when it is no longer there.

### What symptoms do these babies have?
These newborns may cry in a high-pitched way. They may shake or have tremors. Their muscles may be very tight or tense. These symptoms can make babies very uncomfortable.

### How are these babies usually treated?
Doctors first try non-medicine treatments. These are ways to help the baby feel better without using drugs. If the baby still has bad symptoms, doctors then give medicine like morphine to help.

### What is the problem?
Different hospitals use different non-medicine treatments. Doctors do not know which treatments work best. Some hospitals might keep the room very quiet. Others might change how they feed the baby. Some might help the mother care for her baby more.

### Why was this study needed?
Researchers wanted to find out if certain non-medicine treatments really help these babies. They wanted to know which treatments work best. This would help doctors know what to do first when caring for these newborns.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked at six different studies. These studies tested different non-medicine treatments. The studies were done between 1975 and 2018. In total, 353 babies were in these studies.

### What types of treatments were tested?
Four studies tested ways to change the baby's surroundings. These included:
- A bed that rocks by itself
- Placing babies on their tummies
- A special waterbed
- A quiet nursery with less activity

One study tested different types of formula. It compared high-calorie formula to regular formula.

One study tested extra help for mothers. This included special support for breastfeeding.

### Who were the babies in these studies?
All babies were born to mothers who took opioids during pregnancy. All babies showed signs of withdrawal after birth.

### How were babies assigned to treatments?
Each study randomly put babies into different groups. This means chance decided which treatment each baby got. This helps make the study fair.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

The researchers could not say for sure if these treatments help. The quality of the evidence was very low to low.

**For treatments that changed the baby's surroundings:**
- Researchers are not sure if these treatments change how long babies stay in the hospital.
- These treatments may make little or no difference in whether babies need medicine.
- Researchers are not sure if these treatments affect the baby's lowest weight.

**For the feeding study:**
- Researchers are not sure if high-calorie formula helps. They cannot say if it changes the need for medicine. They cannot say if it helps babies gain weight faster.

**For the mother support study:**
- Researchers are not sure if extra breastfeeding help shortens hospital stays. They cannot say if it reduces the need for medicine.

### What does this mean?
The studies did not give clear answers. The evidence was not strong enough. Doctors still do not know which non-medicine treatments work best.

### What is missing?
Many important things were not measured in these studies. Different studies measured different things. This made it hard to compare results.

### What do we need?
We need better studies with more babies. These studies should measure the same things. This would help doctors know which treatments really help newborns with opioid withdrawal.

10.1002-14651858.CD013218.pub2-pls.txt,"Rapid tests for diagnosing malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax in people living in areas where malaria is very common 
What is the aim of the review? 
Malaria infection is caused mainly by two species of malaria parasite: Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. The aim of this review was to evaluate rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to diagnose P vivax infection. 
Why are rapid tests for P vivax malaria important? 
For clinical management, knowing which parasite species is causing the malaria is important as the drug treatments differ. For P vivax infection, an additional drug is required to eliminate the infection from the liver. For public health control of malaria, we know that P falciparum is declining over the previous 15 years, and infections from P vivax have therefore increased in importance. 
What was studied in this review? 
RDTs provide results quickly and are often as a dipstick. We studied RDTs that specifically test for P vivax malaria. RDTs are simple to use, point‐of‐care tests. They are suitable for use in rural settings by primary healthcare workers, using drop of blood on the dipstick that causes colour change and a distinct line that indicates a positive test result. Healthcare workers in rural areas can perform RDTs for P vivax without needing a laboratory or special equipment. We wanted to find out which brands of RDTs were the most accurate for diagnosing P vivax malaria. We compared the new tests against the standard form of diagnosis with microscopy, and also more recent methods polymerase chain reaction (PCR): a molecular method to identify P vivax DNA in blood samples. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We included 10 studies that looked at the accuracy of six diagnostic test brands for detecting P vivax malaria in people with suspected malaria symptoms. The studies were conducted in Ethiopia (four studies), India (two studies) and Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, and Sudan (one study each). 
Compared with microscopy, the Care Start Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test performed well with 99% sensitivity and specificity (four studies). This means that: 
• for every 100 people tested who have P vivax malaria, one person will have a negative test result, and might not receive the right treatment soon enough; 
• for every 100 people tested who do not have P vivax malaria, one will have a positive result, and might receive unnecessary treatment. 
Compared with microscopy, the Falcivax Device Rapid test had a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 99% (two studies). This means that: 
• For every 100 people tested who have P vivax malaria, 23 people will have a negative test result; and, 
• for every 100 people tested who do not have P vivax malaria, one person will have a positive result. 
We are moderately confident (certain) in the accuracy results for the Care Start Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test. The results are from a small number of studies (four), so our findings may change when results from further studies become available. 
We are less confident in the accuracy results for the Falcivax Device Rapid test, because these came from only two studies. Our findings for this test will probably change when results from further studies become available. 
Our results are based on a small number of studies, so we could not reliably assess all six brands of antibody test or compare their accuracy. Most studies included in this review had limitations: it was not clear how people were selected for testing, or how the study results were assessed and checked, which could have affected the results. Some rapid antibody tests were investigated by only one study. Some studies did not report clearly how common P malaria was in the area where the study was done. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for studies published up to 30 July 2019.
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing for a Type of Malaria Called P. vivax

## Plain Title
How Well Do Quick Tests Work to Find P. vivax Malaria?

## Rationale

### What is malaria?
Malaria is a disease you can get from mosquito bites. Two main types of germs cause malaria. These germs are called P. falciparum and P. vivax.

### Why does the type of malaria matter?
Doctors need to know which type of malaria you have. This is because each type needs different drugs to cure it. If you have P. vivax malaria, you need an extra drug. This extra drug kills the germs hiding in your liver. Without this drug, you can get sick again later.

### Why is P. vivax important now?
Over the past 15 years, P. falciparum malaria has become less common. This means P. vivax malaria is now more important to find and treat.

### What did researchers want to learn?
Researchers wanted to test quick tests for P. vivax malaria. These quick tests are called rapid diagnostic tests or RDTs. They wanted to know which test brands work best.

### Why are quick tests helpful?
Quick tests are easy to use. Health workers in rural areas can use them. They do not need a lab or special tools. The test uses just one drop of blood. If you have malaria, a colored line appears on the test stick. This makes it easy to see the result.

## Trial Design

### How did researchers do this study?
Researchers looked at 10 studies from different countries. These countries were Ethiopia, India, Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, and Sudan.

### Who was tested?
The studies tested people who might have malaria. These people had symptoms like fever.

### What did researchers compare?
Researchers compared the quick tests to two other methods:
- Looking at blood under a microscope (the standard way)
- A lab test called PCR that finds malaria DNA in blood

### How many test brands were studied?
The studies looked at six different brands of quick tests.

## Results

### What did the study find?

#### Care Start Malaria Test
One test called Care Start Malaria Pf/Pv Combo worked very well. Four studies tested this brand.

When 100 people with P. vivax malaria were tested:
- 99 people got a correct positive result
- 1 person got a wrong negative result

When 100 people without P. vivax malaria were tested:
- 99 people got a correct negative result
- 1 person got a wrong positive result

This means the test is very accurate.

#### Falcivax Device Rapid Test
Another test called Falcivax Device Rapid worked less well. Two studies tested this brand.

When 100 people with P. vivax malaria were tested:
- 77 people got a correct positive result
- 23 people got a wrong negative result

When 100 people without P. vivax malaria were tested:
- 99 people got a correct negative result
- 1 person got a wrong positive result

This test missed more people who had malaria.

### Why might wrong results matter?
If the test says you do not have malaria when you do, you might not get treatment fast enough. If the test says you have malaria when you do not, you might get drugs you do not need.

### How sure are researchers about these results?
Researchers are fairly confident about the Care Start test results. They are less confident about the Falcivax test results. This is because only a few studies tested each brand.

### What problems did the studies have?
Some studies had issues:
- They did not explain clearly how they picked people to test
- They did not explain how they checked their results
- Some test brands were only studied once
- Some studies did not say how common malaria was in their area

### What does this mean?
The Care Start Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test works well for finding P. vivax malaria. More studies are needed to be more sure about all the test brands.

### When was this review done?
Researchers looked at studies published up to July 30, 2019.

10.1002-14651858.CD013224.pub2-pls.txt,"Proton radiation therapy versus conventional radiation treatment (i.e. photon radiation) for the treatment of chordoma 
What is the issue?Chordoma is a rare tumour that can grow at any location in the spine. Because some of the locations are difficult to reach, some of the tumour may be left behind, even after aggressive surgery. When this happens, radiation to the postoperative area can help reduce the chance of the tumour coming back. Given the closeness to the spinal cord and other important organs, special radiation techniques are required to maximise tumour control, while minimising harm to normal tissues in the body. 
Why is this review important?At the time of this review, there is a lack of evidence to confirm a benefit with proton therapy compared to conventional photon radiation treatment. However, it is important to note that this review found a number of delivery techniques for both proton and photon therapy. As evidence comparing the latest techniques for proton and photon therapy emerges, we will update this review. 
The aim of the review:The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether proton therapy is more effective than photon therapy for improving local control, and reducing mortality, recurrence, and treatment‐related toxicity. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. 
What are the main findings?We included six studies that enrolled 187 adults with chordoma, four of which we included in a meta‐analysis. We are uncertain whether proton radiation therapy compared to conventional photon radiation treatment improves local control, because our confidence in the evidence was very low (2 observational studies, 39 participants). We are uncertain whether proton therapy compared to photon therapy reduces mortality (4 observational studies, 65 participants), recurrence (4 observational studies, 94 participants), or treatment‐related toxicity (1 observational study, 33 participants). 
Quality of the Evidence:We found very low‐certainty evidence for all outcomes due to high risk of bias in all the included observational studies, very small sample sizes, and varying ranges in the duration of participants' follow‐up period between studies. 
Authors' conclusions:From the currently available evidence, we do not know if proton therapy, used for adults with chordoma, is associated with clinically appreciable benefits and acceptable harms. 
The existing research on this question is solely of non‐randomised design, and is underpowered, with substantial imprecision. Any estimates of effect based on the existing insufficient evidence is very uncertain and is likely to change with future research.

## Plain Title
Comparing Two Types of Radiation Treatment for People with Chordoma, a Rare Bone Tumor

## Rationale

**What is chordoma?**
Chordoma is a rare type of tumor. It can grow anywhere along the spine. The spine is the column of bones that runs down your back.

**Why is chordoma a problem?**
Some chordomas grow in places that are hard for doctors to reach. This means surgery cannot always remove all of the tumor. Even after surgery, some tumor may be left behind. When this happens, the tumor can grow back.

**How can radiation help?**
Doctors can use radiation after surgery. Radiation is a treatment that uses special rays to kill tumor cells. This can help stop the tumor from coming back.

**Why is treating chordoma difficult?**
The spine is close to many important body parts. These include the spinal cord and other organs. Doctors must be very careful when giving radiation. They want to kill the tumor but not harm healthy parts of the body.

**What are the two types of radiation?**
There are two main types of radiation treatment. One type uses photons. This is the regular or conventional type. The other type uses protons. Some doctors think proton therapy might work better. It might kill more tumor cells while causing less harm to healthy tissue.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors do not know which type of radiation works best for chordoma. This study looked at the research to find out if proton therapy is better than photon therapy.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**
This was not a single study. Instead, researchers looked at six different studies. They combined the results from these studies. Four of the six studies could be compared together.

**Who was in these studies?**
All studies included adults with chordoma. In total, 187 adults took part across all six studies. The studies were small. Some studies had very few people in them.

**What did researchers compare?**
Researchers compared proton radiation to photon radiation. They wanted to see which one worked better.

**What did researchers measure?**
They looked at several things:
- Did the radiation control the tumor in one place?
- Did people die from their disease?
- Did the tumor come back?
- Did the radiation cause harmful side effects?

**How long were people followed?**
The time people were watched after treatment was different in each study. Some studies followed people for a short time. Others followed people for a longer time.

## Results

**What were the main results?**
The researchers could not tell if proton therapy works better than photon therapy. Here is what they found:

**Tumor control:** Two studies with 39 people looked at this. The researchers are not sure if proton therapy controls tumors better than photon therapy.

**Death from disease:** Four studies with 65 people looked at this. The researchers are not sure if proton therapy reduces deaths compared to photon therapy.

**Tumor coming back:** Four studies with 94 people looked at this. The researchers are not sure if proton therapy stops tumors from coming back better than photon therapy.

**Side effects:** One study with 33 people looked at this. The researchers are not sure if proton therapy causes fewer side effects than photon therapy.

**Why are researchers unsure?**
The quality of the evidence was very low. This means we cannot trust the results very much. There were several problems:
- The studies were very small
- The studies were not designed in the best way
- People were followed for different amounts of time
- The studies had a high risk of errors

**What do the authors conclude?**
Based on current research, we do not know if proton therapy is better than photon therapy for adults with chordoma. More research is needed. Better studies with more people are required. Future research will likely give different answers than what we know now."
10.1002-14651858.CD013225.pub3-pls.txt,"Treatments for seizures in catamenial (menstrual‐related) epilepsy
Background 
Catamenial (menstrual) epilepsy describes a worsening of seizures in relation to the menstrual cycle and may affect around 40% of women with epilepsy. There are specific times within the menstrual cycle when women are most at risk: in the days leading up to a menstrual period and during a menstrual period (perimenstrual or catamenial type 1 pattern); at the time of ovulation (catamenial type 2 pattern); and in the second half of their cycle (luteal phase, or catamenial type 3 pattern). The reason for this increased risk may relate to changes in the levels of progesterone (a hormone released by the ovaries) around the time of a menstrual period and oestrogen (a female sex hormone) surge around ovulation. Studies in animals have demonstrated that lower progesterone may affect how the brain reacts to the brain chemical gamma‐Aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is important in preventing seizures. The link between high levels of oestrogen and risk of seizures remains unclear. 
Current treatment of catamenial epilepsy depends on whether a woman has regular or irregular menstrual periods. If a woman has regular periods, hormonal (e.g. progesterone supplements) and non‐hormonal treatments (e.g. clobazam or acetazolamide) taken prior to and during a period may be used. In women who do not have regular periods, and who therefore cannot predict their period days, stopping periods using synthetic hormones (e.g. medroxyprogesterone (Depo‐Provera) or gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues (triptorelin and goserelin)) are treatment options. 
Catamenial epilepsy is common in women with epilepsy, and may have a significant negative impact on quality of life. Women may not receive appropriate treatment for their catamenial seizures. There is uncertainty regarding which treatment works best and when in the menstrual cycle treatments should be taken. There are also concerns about the possible impact on fertility, the menstrual cycle, bone health, and cardiovascular health. This review aimed to address these issues in order to inform clinical practice and future research. 
Objectives 
The aim of this review was to examine the effectiveness of hormonal and non‐hormonal treatments in stopping seizures in women with catamenial epilepsy. 
Methods 
We searched electronic databases to find relevant studies in which treatment was continued for at least 12 weeks. Our outcomes of interest were: average change in seizures, percentage of women achieving a reduction in seizures by at least 50%, and percentage of women who became seizure‐free. We also examined the reasons why women dropped out of the studies and any reported side effects. 
Results 
We included four randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) of hormonal treatments in the review, two trials evaluating progesterone and two evaluating norethisterone. In all of these studies, the treatment was compared to a placebo (a harmless sugar pill). We did not find any studies testing non‐hormonal treatments or any studies in women with irregular periods. The four included studies involved a total of 192 women aged between 13 and 45 years experiencing catamenial epilepsy. The included studies did not demonstrate any significant differences between groups when comparing progesterone or norethisterone to placebo for seizure outcomes. The included studies reported limited information on side effects, but women taking progesterone were no more likely to withdraw from the study due to side effects than those receiving placebo. 
The evidence is current to July 2021.
Certainty of the evidence 
We judged the certainty of the evidence to be very low to moderate, as the included studies provided unclear information on methods of blinding, recruited small numbers of participants, and were inconsistent in reporting treatment outcomes. 
Conclusions 
We found very limited, mostly low‐certainty evidence, of no difference in seizure outcomes for norethisterone and progesterone versus placebo in women with catamenial epilepsy. Our review highlights an overall lack of information on the effectiveness of a wide range of other hormonal and non‐hormonal treatments currently being used. Further studies in women with catamenial epilepsy are needed in this area. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Treatments for Seizures Related to Menstrual Cycles in Women with Epilepsy

## Plain Title
Do hormone treatments or other medicines help reduce seizures that get worse around menstrual periods in women with epilepsy?

## Rationale

### What is catamenial epilepsy?
Some women with epilepsy have more seizures at certain times during their monthly menstrual cycle. This is called catamenial epilepsy. About 4 out of 10 women with epilepsy may have this problem.

### When do these seizures happen?
Seizures may get worse at three different times:
- In the days before and during a menstrual period
- Around the time of ovulation (when an egg is released)
- During the second half of the monthly cycle

### Why does this happen?
The body makes hormones that change during the menstrual cycle. Two important hormones are progesterone and estrogen. When progesterone levels drop, the brain may not control seizures as well. High estrogen levels may also play a role, but doctors are not sure how.

### Why was this study needed?
Catamenial epilepsy can make life harder for women. Many women may not get the right treatment. Doctors are not sure which treatments work best. They also worry about how treatments might affect fertility, menstrual cycles, bone health, and heart health. This study looked at what treatments might help.

### What treatments are currently used?
For women with regular periods, doctors may prescribe:
- Hormone treatments like progesterone
- Other medicines like clobazam or acetazolamide

For women with irregular periods, doctors may use:
- Medicines that stop periods completely
- Synthetic hormones

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers searched medical databases for studies. They looked for studies that lasted at least 12 weeks. They wanted to find studies that tested both hormone treatments and other medicines.

### What type of studies did they find?
They found four studies. All four were randomized controlled trials. This means women were randomly put into different treatment groups. Some women got real medicine. Others got a placebo (a sugar pill with no medicine).

### Who was in these studies?
A total of 192 women took part. They were between 13 and 45 years old. All had catamenial epilepsy.

### What treatments were tested?
Two studies tested progesterone. Two studies tested norethisterone (another hormone). All studies compared the hormone treatment to a placebo.

### What did researchers not find?
They did not find studies testing:
- Non-hormone medicines
- Treatments for women with irregular periods

## Results

### What did the studies measure?
Researchers looked at:
- How much seizures changed on average
- How many women had at least half as many seizures
- How many women became seizure-free
- Why women stopped taking part in the studies
- What side effects happened

### What were the main findings?
The studies showed no clear difference between hormone treatments and placebo. Women taking progesterone or norethisterone did not have fewer seizures than women taking placebo.

### What about side effects?
The studies gave limited information about side effects. Women taking progesterone were not more likely to stop the study because of side effects than women taking placebo.

### How strong is this evidence?
The evidence quality was very low to moderate. This means we cannot be very confident in the results. The studies had some problems:
- They did not clearly explain all their methods
- They included small numbers of women
- They did not all measure results the same way

### What do these results mean?
There is not enough good evidence to show that progesterone or norethisterone helps reduce seizures in women with catamenial epilepsy. Many other treatments are being used, but no studies have tested them properly.

### What is needed next?
More research is needed. Future studies should:
- Test other hormone and non-hormone treatments
- Include more women
- Use better methods
- Measure results in the same way

This will help doctors know which treatments work best for women with catamenial epilepsy."
10.1002-14651858.CD013228-pls.txt,"Short‐acting insulin analogues versus regular human insulin for type 2 diabetes mellitus
Review question 
Are short‐acting insulin analogues better than regular human insulin for adult, non‐pregnant people with type 2 diabetes? 
Background 
Short‐acting insulin analogues act more quickly than regular human insulin. They can be injected immediately before meals and lead to lower blood sugar levels after food intake. Whether people with diabetes really profit from these newer insulins is debated. 
Study characteristics 
We found 10 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing the short‐acting insulin analogues insulin lispro, insulin aspart, or insulin glulisine to regular human insulin in 2751 participants. The people in the included trials were monitored (followed) for 24 to 104 weeks. 
This evidence is up to date as of 31 October 2018.
Key results 
We are uncertain whether short‐acting insulin analogues are better than regular human insulin for long‐term blood glucose control or for reducing the number of times blood sugar levels drop below normal (hypoglycaemic episodes). The studies were too short to reliably investigate death from any cause. We found no clear effect of insulin analogues on health‐related quality of life. We found no information on late diabetes complications, such as problems with the eyes, kidneys, or feet. No study reported on socioeconomic effects, such as costs of the intervention and absence from work. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The overall certainty of the included studies was low or very low for most outcomes, mainly because all studies were carried out in an open‐labelled fashion (study participants and study personnel knew who was getting which treatment). Several studies also showed inconsistencies in the reporting of methods, and results were imprecise. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Fast-Acting Insulin to Regular Insulin for Type 2 Diabetes

## Plain Title
Comparing Fast-Acting Insulin to Regular Insulin for Adults with Type 2 Diabetes

## Rationale

**What is type 2 diabetes?**
Type 2 diabetes is a condition where the body cannot control blood sugar levels properly. High blood sugar can damage the body over time. It can harm the eyes, kidneys, and feet. People with diabetes often need insulin to help control their blood sugar.

**What are the different types of insulin?**
Regular human insulin has been used for many years. Fast-acting insulin is a newer type. Fast-acting insulin works more quickly in the body than regular insulin. People can inject it right before eating. It helps lower blood sugar after meals.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors are not sure if fast-acting insulin works better than regular insulin. This study looked at whether fast-acting insulin helps people with type 2 diabetes more than regular insulin does.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at 10 different studies. These studies compared fast-acting insulin to regular human insulin. The fast-acting insulins tested were insulin lispro, insulin aspart, and insulin glulisine.

**Who was in the studies?**
A total of 2,751 adults with type 2 diabetes took part. The studies did not include pregnant women.

**How long did the studies last?**
People in the studies were followed for 24 to 104 weeks. This means some studies lasted about 6 months. Others lasted about 2 years.

**When was this information collected?**
The researchers looked at all studies published up to October 31, 2018.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers could not tell if fast-acting insulin works better than regular insulin. Here is what they found:

**Blood sugar control:** The studies did not clearly show that fast-acting insulin controls blood sugar better over time.

**Low blood sugar episodes:** Sometimes insulin can make blood sugar drop too low. This is called hypoglycemia. The researchers could not tell if fast-acting insulin causes fewer of these episodes than regular insulin.

**Quality of life:** The studies did not show clear differences in how people felt about their daily life.

**Death:** The studies were too short to know if one type of insulin affects how long people live.

**Long-term complications:** The studies did not report on long-term diabetes problems. These include damage to the eyes, kidneys, or feet.

**Cost and work:** No studies looked at the cost of treatment. They also did not look at time missed from work.

**Quality of the evidence:**
The quality of the studies was low or very low. This means we cannot be very confident in the results. Here are the main problems:

- People in the studies knew which insulin they were getting. This can affect the results.
- Some studies did not clearly explain their methods.
- The results were not precise enough to draw strong conclusions.

**What does this mean?**
Based on these studies, we cannot say if fast-acting insulin is better than regular insulin for people with type 2 diabetes. More high-quality studies are needed. These studies should last longer and be designed better. They should look at long-term health outcomes and quality of life."
10.1002-14651858.CD013229.pub2-pls.txt,"Does behavioural support help people to stop smoking?
Key messages 
Behavioural support can help more people to stop smoking for six months or longer, without causing unwanted effects. 
Some types of support appear to work better than others. More studies are needed to identify the best ways to support people who are trying to stop smoking, and to identify the best people to support them. 
Stopping smoking 
The best thing people who smoke can do for their health is to stop smoking.
Most people who smoke want to stop, but many find it difficult. People who smoke may use medicines to help them stop. Behavioural support provides an alternative – or additional – way to help people stop smoking. Sometimes behavioural support can be combined with nicotine replacement or other medicines to help people stop smoking. 
Types of behavioural support can include: advice and counselling on ways to make it easier to stop smoking; information about why or how to stop; or a combination. Behavioural support can be given in group sessions or one‐to‐one. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out:
– which types of behavioural support work best to help people stop smoking;
– the best ways to give behavioural support (including the best people to give it); and 
– what aspects of behavioural support help someone to stop smoking.
We also wanted to know if behavioural support can cause any unwanted effects.
What did we do? 
We searched for Cochrane Reviews of behavioural support to stop smoking, to identify relevant studies of adults who smoked. We then compared the studies with each other, to find out how well the different types of behavioural support helped people to stop smoking. 
Search date: we included evidence published up to July 2020. 
What we found 
We found 33 Cochrane Reviews, from which we identified 312 relevant studies in 250,503 adults (aged 18 to 63 years) who smoked cigarettes. The studies investigated 437 different combinations of ways to stop smoking. 
Most studies were conducted in the USA or Western Europe; 115 studies took place in healthcare settings and 195 took place in the community. On average, people taking part in the studies were followed up for 10.5 months. 
The studies compared the effects of behavioural support with:
– no behavioural support;
– usual or standard care;
– less‐intense forms of the behavioural support; or other approaches.
We compared all treatments with each other using a mathematical method called network meta‐analysis. 
What are the main results of our review? 
Compared with no behavioural support it was clear that some types of behavioural support increased people's chances of quitting for six months or longer, including: counselling and giving them money for successfully stopping smoking. More people stopped smoking with these types of support whether or not they were also taking medicines to help them stop smoking. 
Behavioural support by text messages probably helped more people to stop smoking than no support. 
Compared with no support, tailoring behavioural support to the person, or group of people, trying to stop smoking probably slightly increased how many of them stopped smoking, as did support that focused on how to stop smoking. 
Increasing the intensity of the support given, such as contacting people more often or having longer sessions, modestly increased how many people stopped smoking. 
We are uncertain about:
– the effects of other types of behavioural support, including hypnotherapy, exercise‐based support, and entering competitions; and 
– the effect of who gives the behavioural support.
Only some studies reported results for unwanted effects; in these, behavioural support did not increase the numbers of any unwanted effects. 
How confident are we in our results? 
We are confident that counselling and rewards of money help people to stop smoking; we do not expect that more evidence will change these results. 
We are less confident in our results for other types of behavioural support, and about who gives the support and how. We found limitations with some of the studies, including how they were designed, conducted, and reported. These results are likely to change when more evidence becomes available. More studies are needed. 
","# Plain Language Summary: How Behavioral Support Helps People Quit Smoking

## Plain Title
Can Talking to People and Giving Them Support Help Them Stop Smoking?

## Rationale

**What is the problem?**
Smoking is very bad for health. Most people who smoke want to quit. But stopping smoking is hard for many people.

**What can help people quit?**
Some people use medicines to help them stop smoking. Another way to help is called behavioral support. This means giving people advice, tips, and help to make quitting easier.

Behavioral support can include:
- Talking with someone about ways to quit
- Getting information about why and how to stop
- Meeting with others in a group
- Getting one-on-one help

People can use behavioral support alone. Or they can use it along with medicines that help them quit.

**Why did researchers do this study?**
Researchers wanted to find out:
- Which types of support work best
- Who should give the support
- How to give the support in the best way
- If support causes any problems

This study was needed to help more people quit smoking successfully.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this?**
Researchers looked at 33 large reviews of studies. These reviews included 312 studies. Over 250,000 adults took part in these studies.

**Who was in the studies?**
- Adults aged 18 to 63 years
- All of them smoked cigarettes
- Most studies were done in the USA or Western Europe
- Some studies were done in hospitals or clinics
- Other studies were done in the community

**What did the studies test?**
The studies tested 437 different ways to help people quit. They compared people who got behavioral support to people who got:
- No support at all
- Regular care only
- Less intense support
- Other types of help

**How long did the studies last?**
On average, researchers followed people for about 10 and a half months.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

Some types of support clearly helped more people quit smoking for 6 months or longer:

**Counseling works well.** Talking with a counselor about quitting helped people stop smoking. This worked whether or not people also used medicines.

**Money rewards work well.** Giving people money when they successfully quit helped them stop smoking.

Researchers are confident these two methods work. More studies will likely show the same results.

**Text messages probably help.** Getting support through text messages on a phone probably helped more people quit than getting no support.

**Personalized support probably helps a little.** Making the support fit each person's needs probably helped a bit more people quit.

**Focus on ""how to quit"" probably helps.** Support that taught people how to stop smoking probably helped a bit.

**More intense support helps some.** Giving more support helped more people quit. This means:
- Talking to people more often
- Having longer sessions with them

**What about other types of support?**
Researchers are not sure about some methods. These include:
- Hypnosis
- Exercise programs
- Contests or competitions

More studies are needed to know if these work.

**Who should give the support?**
The studies did not clearly show who is best to give support. More research is needed.

**Were there any bad effects?**
Some studies looked at unwanted effects. Behavioral support did not cause any problems or bad effects.

**What do these results mean?**
Behavioral support can help people quit smoking. It does not cause harm. Some types work better than others. Counseling and money rewards work best.

**What is needed next?**
More studies are needed to find:
- The best ways to support people
- The best people to give support
- How to make support work even better

**Bottom line:** If you want to quit smoking, behavioral support can help. Talk to your doctor about getting counseling or other support to help you quit."

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effects of first aid treatments for poisoning that could be feasibly given by people who are not health professionals. 
Background 
Many first aid treatments are recommended for treating people who have ingested poisonous substances. Some treatments, such as activated charcoal (AC), bind to the poison, limiting the body's absorption of it. Others may induce vomiting (such as syrup of ipecac) or dilute or neutralize the poison (such as drinking water, milk or juices). Adjusting the person's body position may also have an effect. 
Study characteristics 
In December 2018 we searched for high‐quality studies (randomly dividing participants into different treatment groups) investigating treatments for poisoning that laypeople can perform. We found 24 studies with 7099 participants. All but one study took place in hospitals; the remaining one was in a home setting. 
Fourteen studies either did not specify the type of poison or studied different kinds. The others investigated overdoses of specific medicines (paracetamol, carbamazepine, antidepressant, benzodiazepine) or poisonous plants (yellow oleander or poisonous berries). 
Twenty‐one trials studied different treatments with activated charcoal: as a single dose or multiple doses, with or without other first aid treatments (a substance to speed up bowel transit), and with or without hospital treatments. Six studies compared syrup of ipecac, with or without other first aid treatments (single‐dose activated charcoal plus bowel transit enhancing substance) versus no treatment. We found no studies that investigated the neutralization or dilution of the poison or the use of certain body positions. 
Key results 
Two studies compared a single dose of activated charcoal to no treatment following poisoning with paracetamol or different kinds of poisoning. We are uncertain about the treatment's side effects, admission to intensive care or worsening of the patient, and there was no information about effects on death, symptom duration, poison uptake or hospitalization. 
One study compared a single dose of activated charcoal to ipecac in mixed types of poisoning. We are uncertain about the effect of activated charcoal compared to ipecac, on the patient's level of coma or the number of unwanted effects. There was no information about effects on death, symptom duration, poison uptake, hospitalization or intensive care admission. 
One study compared ipecac to no treatment in children who ate poisonous berries at home. There may be an increase in the number of unwanted effects for ipecac. There was no information about effects on death, poisoning symptoms, symptoms duration, poison uptake, hospitalization or intensive care admission. 
We also investigated the use of single‐dose or multi‐dose activated charcoal, with or without hospital treatment, compared to each other or no treatment. Furthermore, we investigated the added value of ipecac to single‐dose activated charcoal and the added value of adding bowel transit enhancing substances to AC. 
Certainty of the evidence 
All but one study took place in a hospital setting, which means that the results cannot be directly applied to the lay setting. Because studies did not always report the methods they used, we are uncertain about the quality of the research conduct for many. Outcomes important to patients and pre‐specified by us as important outcomes for this review were often absent or incompletely reported. Our certainty about the results of this review is mostly low to very low. Therefore future research is highly likely to change the findings. 
Conclusion 
Based on the identified evidence, we cannot draw any conclusions about the effects of any of the investigated first aid treatments in a lay setting. 
","# Plain Language Summary: First Aid Treatments for Oral Poisoning

## Plain Title
Can People Without Medical Training Safely Give First Aid to Someone Who Swallowed Poison?

## Rationale

**What is poisoning and why is it a problem?**

Poisoning happens when someone swallows something harmful. This could be too much medicine, cleaning products, or poisonous plants. Poisoning can make people very sick. It can even cause death. Many people get poisoned each year. Quick treatment can help save lives.

**What first aid treatments exist?**

Several first aid treatments are used for poisoning. Activated charcoal is a black powder that sticks to poison in the stomach. This stops the body from taking in the poison. Syrup of ipecac makes people vomit up the poison. Some people give water, milk, or juice to dilute the poison. Others change the person's body position.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors wanted to know if these first aid treatments really work. They wanted to know if people without medical training can safely give these treatments. They also wanted to know which treatments work best. This information could help save lives when poisoning happens at home or before reaching a hospital.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked for high-quality studies from around the world. They searched until December 2018. They found 24 studies with 7,099 people total. These studies tested different first aid treatments for poisoning.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included people of different ages who had swallowed poison. Some studies looked at children who ate poisonous berries. Others studied people who took too much medicine. The medicines included pain relievers, seizure drugs, and antidepressants. Some studies looked at people who ate poisonous plants.

**Where did the studies happen?**

Almost all studies (23 out of 24) took place in hospitals. Only one study happened in homes. This is important because the researchers wanted to know about treatments people can give at home.

**What treatments did researchers test?**

Most studies (21 studies) tested activated charcoal in different ways. Some gave one dose. Others gave multiple doses. Some combined it with other treatments. Six studies tested syrup of ipecac. Researchers did not find any studies testing water, milk, juice, or body positions.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers could not make clear conclusions. Here is what they found for each treatment:

**Activated charcoal versus no treatment:**
Two studies tested this. The researchers are not sure if activated charcoal helps or causes problems. The studies did not report if people died, how long symptoms lasted, or if people needed hospital care.

**Activated charcoal versus ipecac:**
One study compared these two treatments. The researchers are not sure which works better. The study did not report deaths, symptom length, or hospital stays.

**Ipecac versus no treatment:**
One study tested ipecac in children who ate poisonous berries at home. Ipecac may cause more side effects. The study did not report other important information.

**Why are the results unclear?**

The researchers found several problems with these studies. Almost all studies happened in hospitals, not homes. This means the results may not apply to home settings. Many studies did not report important information. They did not say if people died or how long they stayed sick. The quality of the research was often unclear.

**What does this mean?**

Based on these studies, researchers cannot say which first aid treatments work for poisoning. They cannot say if people without medical training should give these treatments. More research is needed. Future studies should happen in home settings. They should report all important outcomes.

**Final conclusion:**
If someone swallows poison, call emergency services right away. Do not give first aid treatments unless emergency services tell you to. The current research does not show which treatments are safe and effective for people without medical training to give."

Review question 
Does the use of respiratory support without endotracheal tube (i.e. non‐invasive) in babies with rapid breathing (transient tachypnea of the newborn) improve lung function and reduce the need for invasive respiratory support with an endotracheal tube? 
Background 
Transient tachypnea (abnormally rapid breathing) of the newborn is characterized by high respiratory rate (more than 60 breaths per minute) and signs of respiratory distress (difficulty in breathing). It typically appears within the first two hours of life in infants born at or after 34 weeks' gestational age. Although transient tachypnea of the newborn usually improves without treatment, it might be associated with wheezing in late childhood. The idea behind using non‐invasive respiratory support for transient tachypnea of the newborn consists of reducing fluid from small cavities within the lungs called the alveoli and providing support to the baby with breathing difficulties. This review reports and critically analyzes the available evidence on the benefit and harms of non‐invasive respiratory support in the management of transient tachypnea of the newborn. 
Study characteristics 
We identified and included three studies (150 newborns in total) comparing the use of non‐invasive respiratory support with oxygen (one study), or different types of non‐invasive respiratory support (two studies). We found two ongoing studies. Evidence is up to date as of February 2019. 
Results 
The very limited available evidence cannot answer our review question. Non‐invasive respiratory support did not improve lung function or reduce the need for respiratory support.  
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Does Breathing Support Without a Tube Help Newborn Babies Who Are Breathing Too Fast?

## Rationale

### What is the condition?
Some newborn babies breathe very fast right after they are born. Doctors call this ""transient tachypnea of the newborn."" These babies take more than 60 breaths each minute. Normal babies take fewer breaths. These babies also show signs that breathing is hard for them. This problem usually starts in the first two hours after birth. It happens most often in babies born at 34 weeks or later.

### Why is this a problem?
Fast breathing can make babies work very hard to breathe. Most babies with this problem get better on their own without treatment. But some of these babies may have wheezing problems later in childhood. This makes it a concern for parents and doctors.

### What did researchers want to learn?
Researchers wanted to know if a special type of breathing support could help these babies. This support helps babies breathe without putting a tube down their throat. The tube that goes down the throat is called an endotracheal tube. Doctors want to avoid using this tube when possible.

### How might this treatment help?
The breathing support without a tube might help in two ways. First, it could help remove extra fluid from tiny air sacs in the lungs. These air sacs are called alveoli. Second, it could make breathing easier for babies who are struggling.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was a review study. Researchers looked at other studies that had already been done. They searched for all studies about this topic up to February 2019.

### Who was in the studies?
The researchers found three studies they could use. These three studies included 150 newborn babies in total. All the babies had the fast breathing problem. The researchers also found two more studies that are still ongoing.

### What did the studies compare?
The studies looked at different types of breathing support. One study compared breathing support without a tube to just giving oxygen alone. Two other studies compared different types of breathing support without tubes to each other.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
The researchers could not answer their main question. There were not enough studies with enough babies to know if the treatment works. The evidence they found was very limited.

### Did the treatment help?
Based on the studies reviewed, the breathing support without a tube did not clearly improve how well the babies' lungs worked. It also did not reduce how often babies needed a breathing tube down their throat.

### What does this mean?
Right now, doctors do not have enough information to know if breathing support without a tube helps babies with fast breathing. More research is needed. Larger studies with more babies would help doctors understand if this treatment works.

### What comes next?
The two ongoing studies may provide more information in the future. Until then, doctors must make decisions based on very limited evidence. They will continue to care for each baby based on what that baby needs.

### Why is this important?
Finding the best way to help newborn babies breathe is very important. Treatments that work without tubes are gentler for babies. But doctors need proof that these treatments actually help before using them routinely."
10.1002-14651858.CD013235.pub2-pls.txt,"Tests for identifying the most suitable antibiotics for a bacterial blood infection: are rapid tests better than standard tests? 
What is the aim of this Cochrane Review? 
People with blood infections need urgent treatment with antibiotics. Identifying the bacteria causing the infection helps ensure the right antibiotic is given. Rapid susceptibility tests are a technology to do this quickly, and aim to improve care. We sought to evaluate whether their use reduce deaths or shortens the illness. 
Key messages 
Rapid susceptibility tests to identify an appropriate antibiotic quickly for people with blood sepsis may make little to no difference to: 
· how many people die within 30 days of diagnosis of blood sepsis;
· how long people stay in hospital; 
· whether given a suitable antibiotic. 
Larger studies will help determine if using rapid susceptibility tests improves these outcomes. 
What was studied in this review? 
Susceptibility tests are done in a laboratory, and measure whether bacteria can grow when exposed to a variety of antibiotics, to assure that the antibiotics given are active against the organism causing the infection. The standard approach is to culture the blood samples, but this takes up to 36 hours to obtain a result. Rapid tests to identify bacteria causing blood infections, and their susceptibilities to antibiotics, provide results in eight hours or less. These rapid susceptibility tests include: 
· tests that look at the direct effect of antibiotics on bacteria (called phenotypic tests); and 
· tests that look for particular genes in the bacteria to see if they are susceptible, or resistant, to an antibiotic (called genotypic tests). 
What are the main results of this review? 
We found six studies that involved 1638 adults with blood infections. All studies took place in specialized medical centres in high‐income countries in Europe, the USA, and East Asia. 
Compared with standard tests, rapid susceptibility tests may make little to no difference to 
· how many people died within 30 days (evidence from six studies in 1638 people);
· how long people stayed in hospital (4 studies in 1165 people); or
· how long it took for people to be given the right antibiotic to treat the infection (5 studies in 1493 people). 
Phenotypic rapid susceptibility tests may reduce the time it takes to receive the right antibiotic; but this is uncertain (evidence from 2 studies in 564 people). 
Genotypic rapid susceptibility tests may make little or no difference to the time it takes to receive the right antibiotic (evidence from 4 studies in 1074 people). 
Our confidence in the results is limited because:
· the numbers of deaths reported in the studies were too low to show an important difference; 
· the tests used and the results from the studies varied widely;
· the studies did not include enough participants to enable firm conclusions.
Further research is likely to change these results.
How up to date is this review? 
We included evidence published up to 21 October 2020.

## Plain Title
Do Fast Tests Help Doctors Choose the Right Antibiotic for Blood Infections Better Than Standard Tests?

## Rationale

**What is a blood infection and why does it matter?**

A blood infection happens when germs get into the blood. This is very serious. People with blood infections can become very sick or die. They need the right antibiotic medicine right away.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors need to know which germ is causing the infection. This helps them pick the right antibiotic. Standard tests take a long time. They can take up to 36 hours to show results. Fast tests can give results in 8 hours or less.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to know if fast tests help patients do better than standard tests. They wanted to see if fast tests help:
- Fewer people die
- People leave the hospital sooner
- People get the right antibiotic faster

**How do these tests work?**

There are two types of fast tests:
- Some tests watch how germs react to different antibiotics. These are called phenotypic tests.
- Other tests look for special genes in the germs. These genes show if the germ can fight off certain antibiotics. These are called genotypic tests.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 6 studies that other scientists had done. They combined the results from all these studies.

**Who was in these studies?**

- 1,638 adults with blood infections
- All studies happened in hospitals in wealthy countries
- Countries included places in Europe, the USA, and East Asia

**What did researchers compare?**

They compared two groups:
- People who had fast tests
- People who had standard tests

They looked at what happened to people in each group.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The fast tests may not help much compared to standard tests. Here is what researchers found:

**Deaths:** About the same number of people died in both groups within 30 days. Fast tests did not seem to save more lives.

**Time in hospital:** People stayed in the hospital about the same amount of time with both types of tests.

**Getting the right antibiotic:** People got the right antibiotic at about the same time with both types of tests.

**Different types of fast tests:** The phenotypic tests (tests that watch germ reactions) might help people get the right antibiotic a bit faster. But researchers are not sure about this. The genotypic tests (tests that look for genes) did not seem to make much difference.

**Why are researchers not completely sure about these results?**

- Not many people died in the studies. This made it hard to see clear differences.
- The studies used different tests and got different results.
- The studies did not include enough people.
- More research could change these findings.

**What does this mean?**

Right now, fast tests do not seem to work much better than standard tests for people with blood infections. Doctors need bigger studies with more people to know for sure if fast tests really help. Future research may show different results.

**How current is this information?**

Researchers looked at all studies published up to October 21, 2020."
10.1002-14651858.CD013240.pub2-pls.txt,"Long‐term pituitary down‐regulation before in vitro fertilisation (IVF) for women with endometriosis 
Review question 
We reviewed the efficacy and safety of treating women with known endometriosis (a disease characterised by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the cavity of the womb) with gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist medication for a period of three to six months prior to in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). We aimed to compare this intervention to no treatment prior to IVF/ICSI, pretreatment with long‐term continuous combined oral contraception (COC) or surgical treatment to remove endometriomas (cysts forming in the ovaries as a consequence of endometriosis). 
Background 
Many women affected by endometriosis suffer with infertility and may, as a result, seek IVF/ICSI treatment. IVF/ICSI is known to be less successful in women with endometriosis and a variety of interventions prior to IVF/ICSI have been proposed to try and improve outcomes. These include long‐term GnRH agonist therapy, long‐term continuous COC therapy or surgery to remove endometriomas. 
Study characteristics 
We found eight randomised controlled trials comparing long‐term GnRH agonist therapy with no pretreatment including a total of 640 women with endometriosis prior to IVF/ICSI. The evidence is current to January 2019. 
Key results 
Compared to no pretreatment, we are uncertain whether long‐term GnRH agonist therapy prior to IVF/ICSI in women with endometriosis affects the live birth rate. The evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth rate is assumed to be 36% with no pretreatment, the chance following long‐term GnRH agonist therapy would be between 9% and 31%. We are also uncertain whether this intervention affects complication rate, clinical pregnancy rate, multiple pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, mean number of oocytes and mean number of embryos. No studies compared long‐term GnRH agonist therapy to long‐term continuous COC therapy or surgery to remove endometriomas. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of very low quality. The main limitations in the evidence were lack of blinding (the process where the women participating in the trial, as well as the research staff, are not aware of the intervention used), inconsistency (differences between different studies) and imprecision (random error and small size of each study).

## Plain Title
Using Hormone Medicine Before IVF Treatment in Women With Endometriosis

## Rationale

**What is endometriosis and why is it a problem?**

Endometriosis is a disease where tissue that normally lines the inside of the womb grows outside of it. This tissue can grow on the ovaries and other areas. Many women with endometriosis have trouble getting pregnant. They may need IVF treatment to help them have a baby.

**What is IVF?**

IVF stands for in vitro fertilization. Doctors take eggs from a woman's ovaries. They mix the eggs with sperm in a lab. If an egg and sperm join, they form an embryo. Doctors then place the embryo in the woman's womb.

**Why was this study needed?**

IVF does not work as well in women with endometriosis. Doctors wanted to find ways to help these women. One idea was to give women hormone medicine before starting IVF. This medicine is called GnRH agonist. It stops the ovaries from working for a few months. Doctors thought this might help IVF work better.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know if taking GnRH agonist medicine for three to six months before IVF would help more women have babies. They also wanted to see if this medicine was safe.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at eight different studies. These studies tested whether GnRH agonist medicine helped women with endometriosis before IVF.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included 640 women total. All the women had endometriosis. All the women were planning to have IVF treatment.

**What did the studies compare?**

The studies compared two groups of women:
- Women who took GnRH agonist medicine for three to six months before IVF
- Women who did not take any medicine before IVF

**How long were women in the studies?**

Women took the medicine for three to six months. Then they had IVF treatment. Researchers followed them to see if they had babies.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers could not tell if the hormone medicine helped or not. The studies were not clear enough to give good answers.

**Live births:**

Researchers are not sure if the medicine helps more women have babies. Out of 100 women who did not take medicine, about 36 had babies. Out of 100 women who took the medicine, between 9 and 31 might have babies. This range is very wide. It means the studies could not show if the medicine really helps.

**Other results:**

Researchers also looked at:
- How many women had problems or side effects
- How many women got pregnant
- How many women had twins or triplets
- How many women had miscarriages
- How many eggs doctors collected
- How many embryos formed

For all of these, the researchers could not tell if the medicine made a difference.

**What was missing?**

No studies compared the hormone medicine to other treatments. These other treatments include birth control pills or surgery to remove cysts.

**Why were the results unclear?**

The studies had several problems:
- The women and doctors knew which treatment was given. This can affect results.
- Different studies showed different results.
- The studies were small. Small studies can give unclear answers.

**What do these results mean?**

Right now, doctors do not have clear proof that GnRH agonist medicine helps women with endometriosis before IVF. More and better studies are needed. These studies should be larger. They should be designed more carefully. Only then can doctors know if this medicine really helps women have babies."
10.1002-14651858.CD013243.pub2-pls.txt,"Animal‐assisted therapy for people with dementia
Review question 
Do therapy sessions that involve live animals help people with dementia?
Background 
Dementia is an increasingly common condition across the world. People with dementia have progressive loss of the ability to think, remember, and communicate; to manage their daily activities; and to mix successfully with other people. Many people with dementia also develop depression and related problems. To date, no treatment has proven able to cure the disease or stop it from getting worse. However, many treatments are in use which aim to improve the well‐being of people with dementia and the people who look after them. Animal‐assisted therapy (AAT) is one of the types of treatment that has been studied. It is thought that animals could help people with dementia by providing companionship and support in daily activities and that this might lead to improvements in physical and mental health, including better mood and fewer problematic behaviours. 
Search date 
We searched medical databases to September 2019.
Key characteristics of included studies 
We included nine randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), involving 305 people with dementia, which compared AAT to a control treatment (either usual care or an alternative treatment). All studies took place in Europe or the US. Seven studies compared AAT to usual care or to another activity which had nothing to do with animals. Two studies compared AAT (using live animals) to the use of robotic animals. One study compared AAT to the use of a soft toy cat. There were some features of the studies which could have biased the results. Study participants and care staff knew what treatment a person was receiving and this might have affected some results. Also, it was not always clear that the randomisation to treatments had been done as well as possible. 
Funding sources 
The studies received funding from various sources, including research grants (four studies), personal donation (one study), and support from an institute that promotes AAT (two studies). Two studies did not describe how they were funded. 
Key results 
We found evidence from two studies with 83 participants that people with dementia who had AAT were possibly slightly less depressed at the end of treatment than people who had standard care or other interventions not related to animals. We also found evidence from three studies with 164 participants that people who received AAT had no clear difference in their quality of life compared to those who did not. However, we found no evidence of an effect on social functioning (interactions with their environment and families), behaviour, agitation, activities of daily living, self‐care ability or balance. There were no clear differences when AAT was compared with the use of a robotic animal in two studies with 156 participants (in social functioning, behaviour, and quality of life), or with the use of a soft toy cat in one study with 64 participants (in social functioning). There were no data on harmful effects of the treatment on the participants and nothing was reported about the effect on the animals in any study. 
Certainty of the evidence 
We took several factors into account when deciding how certain we could be of our results. In this review, two main factors reduced our level of certainty. First, for all the outcomes we looked at, there was only a small number of studies and participants. Second, we thought there was a significant risk that all of the results could have been biased by the way the studies were designed or conducted. For a few outcomes, our confidence was also reduced by inconsistent results between studies. Overall, our certainty about the results ranged from very low to moderate. 
Conclusions 
AAT may slightly reduce depressive symptoms. Otherwise, no conclusions can yet be drawn on whether AAT is beneficial or safe for people with dementia. The small size of the included studies, and the diversity of outcomes and outcome measures, were major issues. We recommend further well‐conducted studies with the inclusion of important outcomes such as emotional and social well‐being, quality of life, side effects, and effects on the animals. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Animal-Assisted Therapy for People with Dementia

## Plain Title

Can spending time with live animals help people with dementia?

## Rationale

**What is dementia?**

Dementia is a brain condition that is becoming more common around the world. People with dementia slowly lose their ability to think clearly and remember things. They may have trouble talking with others and doing daily tasks like getting dressed or eating. Many people with dementia also feel sad or depressed. The disease gets worse over time.

**Why was this study needed?**

Right now, no treatment can cure dementia or stop it from getting worse. However, doctors and caregivers use many treatments to help people with dementia feel better. One treatment being studied is called animal-assisted therapy, or AAT. This means spending time with live animals during therapy sessions.

**How might animals help?**

Researchers think that animals could provide friendship and support to people with dementia. Animals might help people feel less alone. They might also encourage people to be more active. This could lead to better physical health and mental health. People might feel happier and have fewer behavior problems.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at nine different studies. These studies included 305 people with dementia. All studies took place in Europe or the United States.

In these studies, people were randomly put into different groups. Some people received animal-assisted therapy. Other people received usual care or a different treatment. Some studies compared live animals to robotic animals. One study compared live animals to a soft toy cat.

**Who was in the studies?**

All participants had dementia. The studies did not provide detailed information about ages or gender in this summary.

**How long did the studies last?**

The summary does not specify the exact length of time people spent in these studies.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers looked at many different things to see if AAT helped people with dementia.

**Depression:** Two studies with 83 people found that AAT might help reduce feelings of sadness or depression slightly. People who spent time with animals felt a little less depressed than people who did not.

**Quality of life:** Three studies with 164 people looked at overall quality of life. They found no clear difference between people who had AAT and those who did not.

**Other measures:** The researchers found no clear benefits for:
- How people interact with others and their families
- Behavior problems
- Feelings of restlessness or agitation
- Ability to do daily tasks like eating or dressing
- Ability to take care of themselves
- Physical balance

**Comparing live animals to robotic animals:** Two studies with 156 people compared live animals to robotic animals. They found no clear differences in how people interacted with others, their behavior, or their quality of life.

**Comparing live animals to toy cats:** One study with 64 people compared live animals to soft toy cats. They found no clear difference in how people interacted with others.

**Safety:** None of the studies reported harmful effects on the people in the studies. The studies also did not report any effects on the animals used in therapy.

**How certain are these results?**

The researchers were not very certain about these results. There were only a small number of studies. Each study had only a few people. The way the studies were done could have affected the results. People in the studies knew what treatment they were getting. This might have changed how they responded.

**What do these results mean?**

Animal-assisted therapy might help reduce sadness in people with dementia slightly. However, more research is needed. The studies were too small to draw strong conclusions. Different studies measured different things in different ways.

The researchers recommend doing more and better studies in the future. These studies should look at important outcomes like emotional well-being, social well-being, quality of life, side effects, and effects on the animals."
10.1002-14651858.CD013245.pub2-pls.txt,"Adding abiraterone acetate to androgen deprivation therapy for the treatment of metastatic hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer 
Review question 
The aim of this review was to find out what the effect of adding abiraterone was, in men with prostate cancer, who were receiving and still responding to hormone therapy. 
Background 
Abiraterone acetate is a medication that blocks the effect of male sex hormones, and thereby, slows down prostate cancer growth.  
More than 15% of men diagnosed with prostate cancer present with disease that has spread beyond the prostate. Another 15% to 30% of men who undergo primary treatment will experience a return of their cancer. Hormone therapy (drugs to reduce the level of male hormones) has been the main treatment for advanced disease, but this does not work forever. Recent studies have looked at whether drugs that block the growth of prostate cancer cells, such as abiraterone acetate, can improve how men do. 
Study characteristics 
We found two studies (specifically, studies in which 'chance' decided what treatment men got), with a total of 2201 men. The studies compared abiraterone acetate and hormone therapy to hormone therapy alone. In one of the studies, most of the included men had high risk prostate cancer, and had previously undergone local treatment. In the other study, most men had not had previous treatment to their prostate. The evidence is current to 15 May 2020. 
Key results 
Adding abiraterone acetate to hormone therapy improves overall survival but probably not quality of life. It probably improves cancer‐specific survival and reduces disease progression. However, there is also an increase in severe and life‐threatening side effects, likely leading to discontinued treatment, with the addition of abiraterone acetate. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the certainty of the evidence to be high for overall survival (time to death from any cause), and severe and life‐threatening side effects. This means that our estimates are likely to be close to the actual effect for these outcomes. The certainty of the evidence was moderate for quality of life, cancer‐specific survival (time to death from prostate cancer), time to disease progression, and discontinued treatment due to adverse events. This means that our estimates are likely to be close to the actual effect, but there were some limitations in the studies that reduced our confidence in the results.

## Plain Title
Adding Abiraterone to Hormone Treatment for Men with Prostate Cancer That Has Spread

## Rationale

**What is prostate cancer and why is it a problem?**

Prostate cancer is a disease that affects the prostate gland in men. More than 15 out of 100 men learn their cancer has already spread beyond the prostate when first diagnosed. Another 15 to 30 out of 100 men will see their cancer come back after initial treatment. When cancer spreads, it causes serious health problems and can shorten life.

**What treatments are available?**

Doctors use hormone therapy as the main treatment. This means giving drugs that lower male hormones in the body. These hormones help prostate cancer grow. However, hormone therapy stops working well over time.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if adding another drug could help men live longer. Abiraterone acetate is a drug that blocks male hormones in a different way. It may slow down cancer growth better than hormone therapy alone. This study looked at whether adding abiraterone to regular hormone therapy would help men with prostate cancer that had spread.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers reviewed two studies. These studies used a method where chance decided which treatment each man received. This helps make sure the results are fair.

The two studies included 2,201 men total. All men had prostate cancer that had spread to other parts of the body. All men were still responding to hormone therapy.

**What treatments did men receive?**

Some men received hormone therapy plus abiraterone acetate. Other men received hormone therapy alone. Researchers then compared how the two groups did.

**What types of men were in the study?**

In one study, most men had high-risk cancer. They had already received treatment directly to their prostate. In the other study, most men had not received any prostate treatment before.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

Men who took abiraterone with hormone therapy lived longer overall. They also lived longer without their cancer getting worse. Fewer men died from prostate cancer specifically.

However, quality of life did not improve much. Quality of life means how well men felt day to day.

**What were the downsides?**

Men taking abiraterone had more serious side effects. These were severe or life-threatening problems. More men likely stopped treatment because of these side effects.

**How reliable are these results?**

Researchers felt very confident about some findings. They were very sure that abiraterone helps men live longer. They were also very sure it causes more serious side effects.

They were fairly confident about other findings. These included quality of life, cancer-specific survival, and disease progression. Some study limitations made them slightly less certain about these results.

**What does this mean?**

Adding abiraterone to hormone therapy helps men with spreading prostate cancer live longer. It also slows down cancer growth. However, men must balance these benefits against more serious side effects. Men should talk with their doctors about whether this treatment is right for them.

**Conclusion**

This review shows that abiraterone acetate added to hormone therapy provides important benefits for men with prostate cancer that has spread. Men live longer and their cancer grows more slowly. However, the treatment causes more serious side effects. Doctors and patients should discuss both the benefits and risks when choosing treatment.

10.1002-14651858.CD013246.pub2-pls.txt,"Digital interventions for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
Review question 
Do digital interventions help people to improve their self‐management of COPD and their health? Do they help to change their behaviour about managing their symptoms? 
What is COPD? 
COPD is a chronic and progressive condition affecting the airways and lungs. Typically, COPD results from prolonged exposure to harmful chemicals found in tobacco smoke, leading to inflammation of the airways, as well as abnormal expansion of the airspaces of the lungs. Owing to the highly varied nature of COPD, there is much variety in how the condition affects individuals’ lives. A persistent cough and breathlessness are characteristic symptoms of COPD, worsening during flare‐ups (exacerbations) and becoming more severe over time. This makes activities of daily living more difficult and greatly impacts quality of life. 
Managing COPD is complex and varies depending on the severity of the condition. Self‐management techniques often play a role in relieving symptoms, such as breathing exercises, as well as a combination of medication and supplementary oxygen. 
'Digital interventions' and 'telehealth' are terms used to encompass the use of technology to communicate and send information between a patient and a healthcare provider ‐ helping to manage the patient’s condition remotely. This may involve (but is not restricted to) the use of a mobile phone or tablet computer application to log symptoms and lung function, allowing a clinician to adjust medications in real‐time. It may also involve remotely training a patient in self‐management techniques. There is scope for those living with COPD to greatly benefit from the use of such interventions, offering convenient and accessible healthcare provision. 
Why did we do this review? 
We wanted to find out if digital interventions were helpful for people with COPD in terms of managing their condition, and if these interventions played a part in changing their behaviour towards self‐management. Additionally, we wanted to understand the behaviour change techniques incorporated in different digital interventions. 
What evidence did we find? 
Mostly, digital interventions or multi component approaches did not improve walking distance or betterment in one's own belief in managing their condition. There was small short‐term improvement in quality of life with Internet‐based interventions but we cannot be certain whether the improvement is seen long term. Breathing difficulties may improve with long‐term use of digital interventions, but they may have little to no effect on flare‐ups. Due to limited data available, we cannot say with confidence that digital interventions can be used to improve health in people with COPD, or that they reduce harm. There is little or no evidence about possible unwanted side‐effects of digital interventions. More research in this field can provide more robust conclusions for their use and insight into people's behaviours towards these novel approaches. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Can Digital Health Tools Help People Manage Their Lung Disease (COPD)?

## Rationale

**What is COPD?**

COPD is a long-term lung disease. It gets worse over time. Most people get COPD from breathing in harmful chemicals. These chemicals are often found in cigarette smoke.

COPD causes swelling in the airways. It also damages the air sacs in the lungs. People with COPD often cough a lot. They feel short of breath. These problems get worse during flare-ups. Over time, daily tasks become harder to do. This greatly affects quality of life.

**Managing COPD**

Managing COPD can be complex. Treatment depends on how severe the disease is. People often need to learn self-care skills. These include breathing exercises. Many people also need medicines and oxygen.

**What are digital interventions?**

Digital interventions use technology to help manage health. They connect patients with their healthcare team from far away. Examples include phone apps or tablet programs. Patients can track their symptoms on these devices. They can check their lung function. Doctors can then adjust medicines right away. These tools can also teach self-care skills remotely.

**Why was this study needed?**

Digital tools could make healthcare easier to access. They could help people with COPD manage their disease at home. Researchers wanted to know if these tools really work. They wanted to see if digital tools help people take better care of themselves.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at many different studies together. They searched for studies that tested digital health tools. All studies included people with COPD.

The studies tested different types of digital tools. Some used internet-based programs. Others used phone or tablet apps. Some combined digital tools with other treatments.

The review included people of different ages with COPD. It included both men and women. The studies lasted different amounts of time. Some were short-term. Others followed people for longer periods.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The digital tools did not improve walking distance. They did not help people feel more confident about managing their disease.

Internet-based programs showed small improvements in quality of life. But this was only in the short term. Researchers are not sure if the benefits last long term.

Breathing problems might get better with long-term use of digital tools. But the tools may not help prevent flare-ups.

**What does this mean?**

The researchers cannot say for certain that digital tools improve health in COPD. There is not enough strong evidence yet. The studies did not report many side effects. But there is little information about possible harms.

**Conclusions**

More research is needed in this area. Better studies could give clearer answers. They could show if digital tools truly help people with COPD. They could also help us understand how people use these new tools. Right now, we need more proof before recommending digital tools for everyone with COPD.

The researchers believe future studies will provide better information. This will help doctors and patients make good choices about using digital health tools."

Key messages 
– Ocrelizumab is a recently approved medicine to treat people with multiple sclerosis (MS). In relapsing‐remitting MS (where people experience flare‐ups of symptoms), ocrelizumab probably substantially reduces flare‐ups, may substantially reduce worsening of symptoms, and probably makes little or no difference to unwanted effects compared with interferon beta‐1a (a standard treatment for MS), 96 weeks after treatment starts. 
– Compared to placebo (a dummy medicine) after 120 weeks of treatment for primary progressive MS (where people's symptoms worsen gradually), ocrelizumab may reduce worsening of symptoms. Ocrelizumab probably increases unwanted effects but makes little or no difference to the number of serious unwanted effects. 
– We need more, better‐designed studies to test the effectiveness of ocrelizumab and measure unwanted effects.  
What is multiple sclerosis? 
MS is a condition where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the nerves in the brain and spinal cord (the central nervous system). This damage prevents messages travelling from the central nervous system to other parts of the body. It causes a range of potential symptoms from pins and needles to difficulties with balance and walking.  
There are several types of MS. In relapsing‐remitting MS, people have 'flare‐ups' of disease followed by periods of recovery. In primary progressive MS, people's symptoms gradually worsen over time.  
What is ocrelizumab? 
Ocrelizumab is a medicine that has been recently approved to treat relapsing‐remitting MS and primary progressive MS. It is a disease‐modifying therapy, which is a type of medicine that treats the underlying symptoms of MS. Ocrelizumab targets white blood cells in the body's immune system. It sticks to a type of these cells called B cells, and stops them attacking the central nervous system. This prevents inflammation and nerve damage, reducing the number and severity of relapses and slowing the worsening of symptoms. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if ocrelizumab is more effective than any other medicine or placebo in people with relapsing‐remitting MS and primary progressive MS. 
We were interested in how many people:
– had symptom flare‐ups;
– had worsening symptoms;
– experienced unwanted effects; and
– stopped treatment due to unwanted effects.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared ocrelizumab against any other medicine or placebo for people with a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing‐remitting MS or primary progressive MS. People in the studies could be any age or sex, could have mild or severe symptoms, and could have had MS for any length of time. 
We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found four studies with 2551 people with MS. The largest study included 732 people and the smallest included 163 people. The studies were in countries around the world, but mostly in the USA. One study lasted for 24 weeks; two studies for 96 weeks; and one study for at least 120 weeks. Pharmaceutical companies funded the four studies. 
Three studies compared ocrelizumab with interferon beta‐1a in people with relapsing‐remitting MS. Interferon beta‐1a is an older type of disease‐modifying therapy. One study compared ocrelizumab with placebo for people with primary progressive MS. 
Main results 
Ocrelizumab compared with interferon beta‐1a for people with relapsing‐remitting MS, after 96 weeks of treatment: 
– probably substantially reduces the number of people who had flare‐ups;
– may substantially reduce the number of people whose symptoms got worse;
– probably makes little or no difference to unwanted effects; and 
– may substantially reduce the number of people who stopped having treatment due to unwanted effects.  
Ocrelizumab compared with placebo for people with primary progressive MS, after 120 weeks of treatment: 
– may reduce the number of people whose symptoms got worse; 
– probably increases unwanted effects;  and
– may make little or no difference to the number of serious unwanted effects and the number of people who stopped having treatment due to unwanted effects. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the results is moderate to low for several reasons. First, people dropped out of the studies unevenly, which meant more people had one treatment than the other. Second, there was not enough information about some of our points of interest to allow us to draw conclusions for outcomes, there was not enough information available for us to be confident in the results. Finally, changes in symptoms shown by scans could have been due to causes other than disease progression. 
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to 8 October 2021.

## Plain Title

Testing a New Medicine Called Ocrelizumab for People with Multiple Sclerosis

## Rationale

**What is multiple sclerosis?**

Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is a disease where the body attacks itself by mistake. The body's defense system harms the nerves in the brain and spine. These nerves send messages to the rest of the body. When they are damaged, messages cannot get through. This causes many problems. People may feel tingling. They may have trouble walking or keeping their balance.

**What types of MS are there?**

There are two main types of MS. In one type, called relapsing-remitting MS, people have flare-ups. This means their symptoms get worse for a while, then get better. In another type, called primary progressive MS, symptoms slowly get worse over time.

**Why was this study needed?**

MS is a burden for patients. It can make daily life very hard. Doctors need better medicines to help people with MS. Ocrelizumab is a new medicine. It was recently approved to treat both types of MS.

**How might ocrelizumab help?**

Ocrelizumab works by targeting the body's defense system. It sticks to certain white blood cells called B cells. These B cells attack the nerves by mistake. When ocrelizumab sticks to them, it stops them from causing harm. This reduces swelling and nerve damage. It may reduce flare-ups. It may also slow down worsening symptoms.

The study tested if ocrelizumab works better than other medicines or dummy medicines.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

Researchers looked for studies that tested ocrelizumab. They found four studies with 2,551 people who had MS. The studies took place around the world, mostly in the USA.

**Who was in the studies?**

All people in the studies had confirmed MS. They could be any age. They could be male or female. Some had mild symptoms. Others had severe symptoms. Some had MS for a short time. Others had it for many years.

**What did the studies compare?**

Three studies compared ocrelizumab to an older medicine called interferon beta-1a. These studies included people with relapsing-remitting MS. One study compared ocrelizumab to a dummy medicine. This study included people with primary progressive MS.

**How long did the studies last?**

One study lasted 24 weeks (about 6 months). Two studies lasted 96 weeks (about 2 years). One study lasted at least 120 weeks (about 2.5 years).

Drug companies paid for all four studies.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The researchers looked at several things. They counted how many people had flare-ups. They counted how many people got worse. They also looked at unwanted effects.

**For people with relapsing-remitting MS (after 96 weeks):**

When compared to interferon beta-1a, ocrelizumab:
- Probably greatly reduces flare-ups
- May greatly reduce worsening symptoms
- Probably causes about the same number of unwanted effects
- May greatly reduce the number of people who stopped treatment because of unwanted effects

**For people with primary progressive MS (after 120 weeks):**

When compared to dummy medicine, ocrelizumab:
- May reduce worsening symptoms
- Probably causes more unwanted effects overall
- May cause about the same number of serious unwanted effects
- May cause about the same number of people to stop treatment because of unwanted effects

**How relevant is this study?**

This study is important. It shows that ocrelizumab may help people with MS. For relapsing-remitting MS, it may work better than an older medicine. For primary progressive MS, it may slow down worsening symptoms.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

The researchers concluded that ocrelizumab shows promise. However, they need more studies. The studies need better designs. This will help doctors understand how well ocrelizumab works. It will also help them understand unwanted effects better.

**What are the limitations?**

The researchers had some concerns. Some people dropped out of the studies unevenly. There was not enough information about some outcomes. Some changes seen on scans might have had other causes. These issues mean we cannot be completely sure about all the results.

The evidence is current as of October 8, 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013251.pub2-pls.txt,"Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy for lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia 
Review Question 
What are the effects of convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy in men with bothersome urinary symptoms because of an enlarged prostate? 
Background 
Prostate enlargement is common in older men, and can cause bothersome urinary symptoms, such as having to pass their water (voiding) often, a weak stream while voiding, or dribbling. If lifestyle changes and medications don't help, a variety of surgical procedures, including transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), can improve these symptoms. They may also cause unwanted effects, such as problems with ejaculation or erections. Recently, a new procedure called 'convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy' has become available. It is unclear how it compares to other treatments, such as TURP. 
Study characteristics  We found a single study, with 197 men, that compared convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy to a sham procedure (men were made to believe they received treatment, while in reality, they did not), funded by the device company. The men's average age was 62.9 years, and most had a moderate degree of bothersome urinary symptoms. 
We found no studies that compared convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy to another form of active treatment, such as TURP that men with an enlarged prostate and bothersome symptoms might otherwise choose. 
Key results 
Compared to a sham procedure, and with a three‐month follow‐up, convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy may improve urinary symptoms (low certainty of evidence). Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy also likely improves quality of life (moderate certainty of evidence). We are very uncertain whether serious unwanted side effects are more common or not (very low certainty of evidence). Men's erections and ejaculations may be similar in men who have convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy and those who receive the sham procedure (low certainty of evidence). 
Findings of this review are up to date until 18 February 2020.
Certainty of the evidence 
We judged the certainty of the evidence for the outcomes to be moderate, low or very low. Reasons for not being so confident had to do with the study design and the study size. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Water Vapor Treatment for Urinary Problems in Men with Enlarged Prostate

## Plain Title
Testing a New Water Vapor Treatment for Men with Urinary Problems Caused by an Enlarged Prostate

## Rationale

### What is the health problem?
Many older men have an enlarged prostate. The prostate is a small gland near the bladder. When it gets bigger, it can cause problems with urination. Men may need to urinate often. They may have a weak stream. They may dribble after urinating. These problems can be very bothersome.

### What treatments are available?
First, doctors try lifestyle changes and medicines. If these do not work, surgery may help. One common surgery is called TURP. It removes part of the prostate. Surgery can improve symptoms. But it may also cause unwanted effects. Some men have problems with ejaculation. Some men have problems with erections.

### What is being tested?
A new treatment uses water vapor and heat. It is called convective radiofrequency water vapor thermal therapy. We will call it ""water vapor treatment"" in this summary. Doctors wanted to know if this treatment works. They wanted to know if it is safe. They wanted to compare it to other treatments.

### Why is this study needed?
This new water vapor treatment is now available. But doctors do not know how well it works. They do not know how it compares to other treatments like TURP. This study helps answer these questions.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers found one study. The study had 197 men. The men were about 63 years old on average. Most had moderate urinary problems.

### What did the study compare?
The study compared two groups. One group got the water vapor treatment. The other group got a fake treatment. The fake treatment is called a sham procedure. Men thought they got real treatment. But they did not. This helps researchers know if the real treatment works.

### What is missing?
Researchers found no studies comparing water vapor treatment to real surgery like TURP. This information would be helpful. But it is not available yet.

### How long did the study last?
The study followed men for three months after treatment.

## Results

### What did the study find about urinary symptoms?
The water vapor treatment may improve urinary symptoms. Men who got the real treatment had better symptoms than men who got the fake treatment. However, researchers are not very confident in this finding. The study was small. More research is needed.

### What did the study find about quality of life?
The water vapor treatment likely improves quality of life. Men who got the treatment felt better about their daily lives. Researchers are fairly confident about this finding.

### What about side effects?
Researchers are very uncertain about serious side effects. They do not know if serious problems happen more often with the real treatment. The study was too small to answer this question well.

### What about sexual function?
The treatment may not affect erections or ejaculation much. Men who got the real treatment had similar sexual function to men who got the fake treatment. However, researchers are not very confident about this finding.

### What are the main conclusions?
The water vapor treatment may help men with urinary problems from an enlarged prostate. It may improve symptoms and quality of life. Sexual function may stay the same. But researchers need more information. They need larger studies. They need studies that compare water vapor treatment to surgery like TURP.

### How confident are researchers?
Researchers have low to moderate confidence in most findings. The study was small. Only one study was available. More research will help doctors know if this treatment is a good choice.

### When was this information current?
This review includes studies found up to February 18, 2020."
10.1002-14651858.CD013253.pub2-pls.txt,"Do health education interventions lead to early treatment for women with symptoms of endometrial (womb) cancer 
Background Endometrial (womb) cancer arises from the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the lining of the womb. Diagnosis when the disease is still at an early stage (cancer is still within the womb, without spread into nearby tissues) is common, as most women with the disease experience abnormal vaginal bleeding and go to their doctors. However, delayed management of endometrial cancer still occurs. This is particularly a problem for women who are about to go through or are in the menopause. Providing educational information to women and healthcare providers regarding symptoms relating to endometrial cancer may raise awareness of the disease and reduce delayed treatment. We undertook this review to assess whether endometrial cancer education led to women with endometrial cancer symptoms visiting their doctors and being referred for treatment earlier than when there was no education. 
The aim of the review We undertook this review to assess whether endometrial cancer education led to women with endometrial cancer symptoms visiting their doctors and being referred for treatment earlier than when there was no educational information available. 
Main findings We planned to include randomised controlled trials (studies in which people or groups of people are allocated by chance to two or more groups, treating them differently). In the absence of randomised controlled trials, we planned to include studies where participants were not randomised but that included an assessment of the benefits of health education compared to no health education. We searched scientific databases and checked the titles and abstracts of 4880 possibly relevant articles and assessed the full text of 16 of these references. However, we found no studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Conclusions There is currently an absence of evidence to indicate whether providing health education to healthcare providers, or individuals or both, promotes early presentation and referral for women with symptoms of endometrial cancer. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Can teaching women and doctors about womb cancer signs help women get treatment sooner?

## Rationale

**What is womb cancer?**
Womb cancer (also called endometrial cancer) happens when abnormal cells grow out of control in the lining of the womb. The womb is the organ where a baby grows during pregnancy.

**What are the signs?**
Most women with womb cancer notice unusual bleeding from the vagina. This bleeding is not normal for them. Because of this clear sign, many women see their doctor early. Doctors can often find the cancer while it is still only in the womb and has not spread.

**What is the problem?**
Some women still wait too long before seeing their doctor. This delay is especially common in women who are going through menopause. Menopause is when a woman's monthly periods stop. These women may think their unusual bleeding is just part of menopause.

**Why was this study needed?**
Researchers wanted to know if teaching women and doctors about womb cancer signs would help. They thought that if women knew more about the warning signs, they might see their doctor sooner. If doctors knew more, they might send women for tests faster. Earlier treatment could help women have better outcomes.

**What did researchers want to find out?**
The researchers wanted to see if education about womb cancer helped women get treatment earlier. They compared education programs to no education at all.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers look for studies?**
The researchers searched for studies that tested health education programs. They looked for studies where some women or doctors got education and others did not. This way, they could compare the two groups.

They wanted to find studies where people were put into groups by chance. These are called randomized controlled trials. These studies give the best answers. If they could not find these studies, they would look for other types of studies that still compared education to no education.

**What did they search?**
The researchers searched scientific databases. These are collections of published studies. They looked at nearly 5,000 article titles and summaries. They read 16 full articles carefully to see if they fit.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**
The researchers found no studies that fit their needs. Not a single study tested whether education about womb cancer helped women see doctors sooner or get referred for treatment faster.

**What does this mean?**
Right now, we do not know if teaching women and doctors about womb cancer signs actually helps. There is no proof that education programs work. There is also no proof that they do not work. We simply do not have the information yet.

**Why is this important?**
Without studies, doctors and health programs cannot know if education is worth the time and money. They cannot tell women with confidence that learning about womb cancer signs will help them get better care.

**What needs to happen next?**
Researchers need to do studies that test education programs. These studies should measure if women see their doctors sooner after learning about warning signs. They should also measure if doctors refer women for tests faster after getting education.

**Main conclusion**
We need more research. Currently, there is no evidence to show whether health education helps women with womb cancer symptoms get treatment earlier. Good studies are needed to answer this important question."
10.1002-14651858.CD013256.pub2-pls.txt,"Infection risk after surgery in patients using medications for inflammatory bowel disease 
Background  
More than 1.2 million individuals in North America are affected by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is a condition that involves inflammation in the large and/or small intestine(s), resulting in symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain. Many of the medications used to treat IBD suppress the immune system. As a result, use of these medications increases the risk of infection. This increased risk of infection is particularly concerning in patients undergoing surgery. 
Review Question  
This systematic review examined the combined data from 68 previously published studies to determine whether patients using IBD medications around the time of surgery had more infections compared to those not using the same medications. 
Study Characteristics  
This systematic review is current up to 29 October 2019. It included 68 studies in patients with IBD who underwent surgery. Most participants were 18 years or older and both men and women were included. Five IBD medication groups were examined within our study. Infections were tracked up to 30 days after surgery. 
Key Results  
Analyses of this large set of data revealed that infection risk around the time of surgery varied depending on which type of IBD medication the patients were on. Patients being treated with corticosteroids or anti‐TNF agents seemed to have more infections after surgery, while those on 5‐ASA, immunomodulators or anti‐integrin agents did not seem to have more infections after surgery. These findings should be taken with caution as our review included studies which were of limited quality, and therefore we were not able to draw any firm conclusions.These findings could help doctors choose which medications to treat IBD patients with before surgery. Decisions should be tailored to each patient's unique health needs. In addition, this study suggests the need to carefully monitor for infections after surgery in patients who are on certain types of IBD medications.  
Limitations  
One limitation of this systematic review was its dependence on data from a wide range of previously published studies, with various approaches and quality control standards. Most studies examined had very low certainty regarding its conclusions. This review illustrates the need for future high‐quality research examining the impact of medications used to treat IBD on infection risk after surgery. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Do Medicines for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Increase Infection Risk After Surgery?

## Rationale

### What is inflammatory bowel disease?
More than 1.2 million people in North America have inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD. IBD causes swelling in the intestines. The intestines are the long tubes in your belly that digest food. When they swell, patients can have diarrhea and belly pain.

### How is IBD treated?
Doctors use medicines to treat IBD. Many of these medicines work by slowing down the immune system. The immune system is your body's defense against germs. When the immune system is slowed down, it is easier to get infections.

### Why was this study needed?
Getting an infection is especially risky for patients having surgery. Doctors needed to know which IBD medicines might make infections more likely after surgery. This information helps doctors choose the safest medicines for their patients.

### What did researchers want to learn?
Researchers wanted to find out if patients taking IBD medicines had more infections after surgery. They looked at five different types of IBD medicines.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was a systematic review. Researchers looked at 68 studies that were already published. They combined all the data together. This gave them a very large amount of information to study.

### Who was in the studies?
The studies included patients with IBD who had surgery. Most patients were 18 years old or older. Both men and women were included in the studies.

### What medicines did researchers study?
Researchers looked at five groups of IBD medicines:
- 5-ASA
- Corticosteroids
- Immunomodulators
- Anti-TNF agents
- Anti-integrin agents

### How long did researchers track patients?
Researchers tracked infections for up to 30 days after surgery.

### When was this review done?
The review included studies published up to October 29, 2019.

## Results

### What did the study find?
The risk of infection after surgery was different for each type of medicine.

**Medicines that seemed to increase infection risk:**
- Corticosteroids: Patients taking these had more infections after surgery
- Anti-TNF agents: Patients taking these had more infections after surgery

**Medicines that did not seem to increase infection risk:**
- 5-ASA: No increase in infections
- Immunomodulators: No increase in infections
- Anti-integrin agents: No increase in infections

### What do these results mean?
These findings can help doctors make better choices. They can pick safer medicines for patients before surgery. Doctors should watch patients closely for infections after surgery. This is especially important for patients taking certain medicines.

### Important caution about the results
Researchers warn that these findings should be used carefully. Many of the 68 studies they reviewed were not high quality. This means the conclusions are not certain. Doctors cannot make firm decisions based only on these results.

### What should happen next?
This review shows that better research is needed. Future studies should be higher quality. They should carefully examine how IBD medicines affect infection risk after surgery.

### How does this help patients?
This study gives doctors useful information. However, each patient is different. Doctors should make treatment choices based on each patient's unique health needs. The study reminds doctors to watch for infections after surgery in patients taking IBD medicines.

### Main conclusion
Some IBD medicines may increase infection risk after surgery. Others do not seem to increase this risk. More high-quality research is needed to be sure about these findings."
10.1002-14651858.CD013257.pub3-pls.txt,"Immunotherapy versus chemotherapy for people with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer who have not been not previously been treated 
Review question 
Is immunotherapy more effective and less toxic than chemotherapy for people diagnosed with non‐small cell lung cancer (a subtype of lung cancer) who have not previously been treated and who are not suitable for curative treatment? 
Background 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths and non‐small cell lung cancer represent more than 85% of all lung cancer cases. Curative surgery and radiotherapy are not treatment options when the disease is at an advanced stage and until recently these people were offered chemotherapy. Since 2016, immunotherapies (antibodies able to stimulate the immune system against cancer cells) have been shown to improve survival for these patients. 
Side effects of immunotherapies are mainly inflammation of the tissues caused by the activation of the immune system against different organs, while chemotherapy usually causes a reduction in the white blood cells and red blood cells, hair loss, nausea and vomiting.In this Cochrane Review, we tried to find out how effective and safe immunotherapies (given alone or as combinations) are compared to standard chemotherapy for people with non‐small cell lung cancer who are not suitable for possibly curative treatment. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the main databases and records of conference meetings up to 31st December 2020. We included seven studies (5893 participants) comparing immunotherapies (antibodies that interact with specific proteins called immune checkpoints) with chemotherapy for people with non‐small cell lung cancer not previously treated. 
Key results 
We reported the results by PD‐L1 levels (a protein produced by the tumour or immune cells and bound by immune checkpoint inhibitors) 
In people with more than 50% of tumour/immune cells expressing PD‐L1 protein, single immunotherapy might improve survival with fewer side effects. In addition, treatment with combined immunotherapies may improve survival in both people with high expression of PD‐L1 protein.The rate of toxic effects may be the same for people treated with combined immunotherapies or chemotherapy. 
Certainty of evidence 
Overall, the certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to low.
Conclusions 
For people with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer with a high expression of PD‐L1 protein, immunotherapies alone or combinations of immunotherapies prolonged life compared to chemotherapy. The frequency of side effects may be lower with the use of immunotherapies alone compared to chemotherapy. The frequency of side effects may not differ between combinations of immunotherapies and chemotherapy. 
 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Comparing Immune System Drugs to Standard Cancer Drugs for People with Advanced Lung Cancer Who Have Not Yet Received Treatment

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Lung cancer causes more deaths than any other cancer. Most lung cancer cases (more than 85 out of 100) are a type called non-small cell lung cancer. When this cancer spreads or grows large, doctors cannot cure it with surgery or radiation treatment. This is called advanced lung cancer.

**What treatments are available?**

For many years, doctors treated advanced lung cancer with chemotherapy. These are drugs that kill fast-growing cancer cells. However, chemotherapy often causes problems like low blood counts, hair loss, feeling sick, and throwing up.

Since 2016, doctors have a newer treatment option called immunotherapy. These drugs help the body's own defense system (the immune system) fight cancer cells. Immunotherapy can cause different side effects than chemotherapy, mainly swelling in body tissues.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to find out if immunotherapy works better than chemotherapy for people with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. They also wanted to know which treatment causes fewer side effects. This information helps doctors and patients choose the best treatment.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at seven different studies. These studies included 5,893 people total. All these people had advanced non-small cell lung cancer. None had received treatment before.

The studies compared two types of treatment:
- Immunotherapy (either alone or combined with other immunotherapy drugs)
- Standard chemotherapy

Researchers measured a protein called PD-L1 in the cancer cells. Some people had high levels of this protein (more than 50 out of 100 cells had it). Others had lower levels. This protein helps predict how well immunotherapy might work.

The researchers collected information up to December 31, 2020. They looked at how long people lived and what side effects they had.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The results depended on PD-L1 protein levels in the cancer.

**For people with high PD-L1 levels (more than 50 out of 100 cells):**

When people received immunotherapy alone, they lived longer than people who received chemotherapy. They also had fewer side effects.

When people received combined immunotherapy drugs, they also lived longer than people who received chemotherapy. However, side effects happened at similar rates in both groups.

**How strong is this evidence?**

The quality of evidence was moderate to low. This means researchers are somewhat confident in these findings, but more studies could change the results.

**What does this mean for patients?**

For people with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have high PD-L1 protein levels, immunotherapy appears to work better than chemotherapy. People live longer with this treatment.

Using immunotherapy alone may cause fewer side effects than chemotherapy. Using combined immunotherapy drugs may cause about the same number of side effects as chemotherapy.

These findings help doctors recommend the best treatment for each person. Patients with high PD-L1 levels may benefit most from immunotherapy instead of standard chemotherapy.

**Important note:**

These results apply mainly to people whose cancer cells have high levels of PD-L1 protein. Doctors test for this protein before deciding on treatment. People with lower PD-L1 levels may have different results."
10.1002-14651858.CD013259.pub2-pls.txt,"Preparing a patient with bowel cancer for surgery with multiple interventions
Aim of this review 
The aim of this review is to find out whether multiple interventions introduced in the period prior to surgery for bowel cancer could prepare a patient by increasing the patient's overall fitness, and thus improve outcomes after surgery. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all available randomised controlled trials on this topic. 
Key messages 
Only three studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, information was not available for all outcomes and the overall certainty of evidence was very low to moderate. More and larger studies are needed to gather evidence on this topic. 
What was studied in the review? 
Surgery is often given to cure patients diagnosed with early stage bowel cancer. Surgery has a negative impact on the overall fitness of the patient. The energy level decreases, patients are more dependent in their daily living activities, and quality of life decreases. Furthermore, complications may occur after surgery causing a further decrease of fitness. Preoperative interventions, such as exercise programmes, nutritional advice and supplements, as well as mental support, may increase the fitness of the patient, prior to surgery. This concept is called prehabilitation. The impact of surgery is diminished and consequently results in faster and better recovery. Combining such preoperative interventions results in better preparation for surgery because each interventions may help to strengthen the effects of the others. The review authors aimed to study the effect of such multiple‐intervention preparation programmes before surgery for patients with bowel cancer. The review authors focused on these outcomes: physical fitness, number of complications after surgery, death rate, quality of life (assessed with questionnaires), length of stay in the hospital, number of emergency department visits, number of re‐admissions after surgery, safety of the programme and adherence to the programme. They compared groups with prehabilitation programmes to groups not receiving any preparation prior to surgery, other than standard care. 
Main results of this review 
The review authors found three studies with 250 participants with bowel cancer, without metastases, scheduled for surgery. Studies were conducted in Canada. A total of 130 participants followed four‐week prehabilitation programmes prior to surgery, which included exercises, nutritional advice and supplements, as well as techniques to reduce anxiety about their cancer and its treatment. Another 120 participants followed identical programmes, but only started them after the surgery, when they were discharged from hospital. 
Overall, the review authors did not find an improvement in either group of participants. The certainty of evidence was very low to moderate, mainly because of the small numbers of studies and participants included in the review. Physical fitness potentially improves and the number of complications and emergency department visits may diminish in patients receiving prehabilitation programmes prior to surgery. On the other hand, more re‐admissions to the hospital occurred after prehabilitation programmes. Because data on death rates, quality of life, length of stay in the hospital, safety of the programme and adherence to the programme was not complete or not reported, the review authors did not analyse these outcomes. Due to the mostly low or very low certainty of the evidence, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to January 2021 and also looked for unpublished, ongoing studies up to March 2021. In a future update of this review, many ongoing studies will likely have been completed, which can be included to collect more evidence on this subject. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Preparing Patients for Bowel Cancer Surgery with Multiple Support Programs

## Plain Title
Can exercise, nutrition, and mental support programs before surgery help bowel cancer patients recover better?

## Rationale

**What is bowel cancer and why does surgery affect patients?**

Bowel cancer is a disease that affects the large intestine. Doctors often use surgery to remove the cancer in patients who are diagnosed early. However, surgery takes a toll on the body. After surgery, patients often feel very tired. They may need more help with daily tasks like getting dressed or cooking meals. Their overall quality of life goes down. Some patients also develop problems after surgery that make their recovery even harder.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to find out if helping patients get stronger before surgery could improve their recovery. They looked at programs that combine three types of support: exercise training, nutrition advice and supplements, and mental health support to reduce worry. This approach is called prehabilitation, which means getting ready before surgery. The idea is simple: if patients are fitter and stronger before surgery, they may handle the surgery better and recover faster.

**What did researchers hope to find?**

Researchers thought that combining exercise, nutrition, and mental support might work better than any single approach alone. Each type of support might make the others work better. They wanted to see if these combined programs could help patients stay more active, have fewer problems after surgery, and feel better overall.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked for all available studies on this topic. They found three studies that met their standards. These studies included 250 adults with bowel cancer. The cancer had not spread to other parts of the body. All patients were scheduled to have surgery.

**What did patients in the studies do?**

All studies took place in Canada. Half of the patients (130 people) joined a four-week program before their surgery. This program included three parts: exercise sessions, nutrition advice with supplements, and techniques to reduce anxiety about their cancer and treatment.

The other half (120 people) did the same program but started after surgery when they went home from the hospital. Researchers compared these two groups to see which approach worked better.

**How long did the study last?**

Patients in the preparation group did their program for four weeks before surgery. Researchers then followed all patients through their surgery and recovery period.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

Overall, researchers did not find major differences between the two groups. However, the results are uncertain because only three small studies were available.

**Possible benefits:**

Patients who did the preparation program before surgery might have improved their physical fitness. They may have had fewer complications after surgery. They may have needed fewer emergency department visits.

**Possible concerns:**

More patients who did the preparation program before surgery had to return to the hospital after going home. Researchers are not sure why this happened.

**Missing information:**

The studies did not provide complete information about several important questions. Researchers could not analyze death rates, quality of life scores, how long patients stayed in the hospital, whether the programs were safe, or how many patients completed the programs.

**What do these results mean?**

The researchers cannot make strong conclusions. The evidence quality was very low to moderate. This means the findings might change when more studies are done. Only three small studies were available, which is not enough to be certain about the results.

**What happens next?**

Many new studies are currently underway. When researchers update this review in the future, they will have more information. Larger studies with more patients are needed to determine whether these preparation programs truly help bowel cancer patients recover better after surgery.

**Important note:**

Because the evidence is limited and uncertain, patients should talk with their doctors about whether preparation programs might help them personally."

Key messages 
· Ketorolac may reduce short‐term pain after surgery by 50% (half) or more in more people than a placebo (dummy treatment).· There may be little to no difference between ketorolac and other anti‐inflammation medicines in the number of people whose pain is reduced by half or more.· Ketorolac probably causes slightly more unwanted effects than placebo and other anti‐inflammation medicines; more evidence is required to establish if it causes serious unwanted effects. 
Treating short‐term pain after surgery 
It is common for people to feel pain in the short term (within six hours) after surgery. Often, medicines called non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are given to relieve this pain. 
NSAIDS work by stopping the body’s production of chemicals that cause inflammation and pain. A potential advantage of using NSAIDs is that they may limit the need for stronger pain‐relief medicine such as opioids. Opioids can cause unwanted (adverse) events such as nausea and vomiting, constipation, breathing problems and allergic reactions. People may become addicted to opioids if they take a lot of them. 
NSAIDs can also cause unwanted effects. These include bleeding at the site of the surgical wound, and potential injury to the kidneys and gut. It is therefore important to weigh the benefits and risks of NSAIDs when considering using them to reduce pain shortly after surgery. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out about the benefits and risks of using a specific NSAID, ketorolac, for relief of short‐term pain after surgery. Ketorolac can be given as an injection, which may be useful when patients cannot take medicines by mouth. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that involved adults (aged over 18) and compared a single injection of ketorolac against: 
· a placebo (dummy treatment); or· another treatment. 
We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found 12 studies that involved 1905 people in total. The studies investigated the treatment of pain after surgery on the abdomen, pelvis, teeth, bones, joints and muscles. Most studies (10) treated people with a dose of 30 milligrams of ketorolac. They compared ketorolac against: 
· a placebo;· another NSAID; or· an opioid. 
Here we present the findings from comparisons between ketorolac and placebo or other NSAIDs. 
Pain reduction 
The evidence suggests that:
· around three times more people may have their pain reduced by 50% (half) or more within six hours of surgery when treated with ketorolac rather than placebo; and· there could be little to no difference between ketorolac and other NSAIDS in the number of people with pain reduced by 50% or more within four or six hours of surgery. 
Need for extra pain medicines (rescue medication) 
Ketorolac could delay the need for rescue medication compared to placebo or other NSAIDs. The evidence is not robust enough to show if fewer people need rescue medicine when treated with ketorolac. 
Adverse effects 
Ketorolac probably causes slightly more adverse effects than placebo and other NSAIDS. Serious adverse effects (such as blood collecting in the muscles around the abdomen, causing severe pain) were rare in the studies we found; the evidence suggested there may be little to no difference in the number of serious adverse events between ketorolac and placebo or other NSAIDS. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Studies were small, and most may have been conducted in ways that could introduce errors into their results. This limited our confidence in the evidence.

## Plain Title
Does a Single Shot of Ketorolac Help Adults with Pain After Surgery?

## Rationale

### What is the problem?
Most people feel pain right after surgery. This pain usually happens within the first six hours. Doctors need safe and effective ways to help reduce this pain.

### What medicines are used?
Doctors often use pain medicines called NSAIDs. These medicines stop the body from making chemicals that cause pain and swelling. Ketorolac is one type of NSAID. Doctors can give it as a shot. This is helpful when patients cannot swallow pills.

### Why is this study important?
Strong pain medicines called opioids work well but can cause problems. People may feel sick to their stomach. They may vomit or have trouble going to the bathroom. Some people have trouble breathing. Others may become addicted if they take too much. NSAIDs like ketorolac might help people need less opioid medicine.

However, NSAIDs can also cause problems. They may cause bleeding where the surgery was done. They might hurt the kidneys or stomach. Doctors need to know if the benefits of ketorolac are worth the risks.

### What did researchers want to learn?
Researchers wanted to find out if ketorolac works well for pain right after surgery. They also wanted to know what problems it might cause.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked for studies that tested ketorolac in adults over 18 years old. They found 12 studies with 1,905 people total.

### Who was in the studies?
The studies included people who had different types of surgery. Some had surgery on their belly or pelvis. Others had tooth surgery. Some had surgery on bones, joints, or muscles.

### What did researchers compare?
The studies compared ketorolac to other treatments:
- A fake treatment with no medicine (called placebo)
- Other NSAID medicines
- Opioid pain medicines

Most studies used 30 milligrams of ketorolac given as a shot.

### How long did the studies last?
The studies looked at pain relief within six hours after surgery.

## Results

### What did the study find about pain relief?
Ketorolac may work better than placebo. About three times more people had their pain cut in half when they got ketorolac instead of placebo.

Ketorolac may work about the same as other NSAIDs. There was little difference between ketorolac and other NSAID medicines in cutting pain in half.

### Did people need extra pain medicine?
People who got ketorolac may have waited longer before needing extra pain medicine. This was true compared to both placebo and other NSAIDs. The studies were not strong enough to show if fewer people needed extra medicine overall.

### What problems did ketorolac cause?
Ketorolac probably causes slightly more side effects than placebo or other NSAIDs. These side effects were usually not serious.

Serious problems were rare in all groups. One serious problem was blood collecting in muscles near the belly. This causes severe pain. The studies showed little difference in serious problems between ketorolac and other treatments.

### What are the study limits?
The studies were small. Many studies may have had errors in how they were done. This makes the results less certain. More research is needed to be sure about these findings.

### What do the results mean?
Ketorolac given as a shot may help reduce pain after surgery. It may work better than placebo. It seems to work about as well as other NSAID medicines. It probably causes some side effects but serious problems appear rare. Doctors can consider using ketorolac when patients need pain relief after surgery but cannot take pills.

### How current is this information?
Researchers looked for studies published up to April 2020."
10.1002-14651858.CD013264.pub2-pls.txt,"What are the benefits and risks of a single injection of ibuprofen (an anti‐inflammation medicine) for relieving short‐term pain after surgery in adults?  
Key messages 
‐ There is not enough evidence to determine whether intravenous (injection into a vein) ibuprofen is an effective treatment for adults with pain after surgery or if it can harm them.  
‐ It would be beneficial if future studies on this topic were well‐designed with a large number of patients to determine if ibuprofen is an effective treatment for the management of pain after surgery. 
‐ More evidence is required to establish if ibuprofen causes serious unwanted effects.
Treating short‐term pain after surgery 
Pain is common in the short term (within 6 hours) after surgery (postoperative pain). 
Non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, aspirin‐like drugs) are often delivered along with opioids (such as morphine) to treat this type of pain. However, NSAIDs can have side effects. NSAIDS (such as ibuprofen) may result in bleeding (e.g. at the site of an incision or wound) and may result in injury to the kidneys and gut.  
Patients need more and better treatment options to help manage short‐term pain after surgery. There is a lot of concern about using opioids to treat short‐term pain because of the risk that patients can develop unpleasant side effects or opioid over‐use disorder. It is therefore important to weigh the benefits and risks of NSAIDs when considering using them to reduce pain shortly after surgery. 
What did we want to find out? 
Ibuprofen is a NSAID that can be delivered intravenously. We wanted to know if intravenous ibuprofen (delivered by injection or drip) is a helpful treatment option to manage moderate‐to‐severe pain when patients cannot take medicines by mouth.  
What did we do? 
To make the comparison fair, patients in the studies must all have had the same random chance (like the flip of a coin) to receive the ibuprofen or the other treatment.  
We searched the medical literature (clinical studies) up to June 2021, where intravenous ibuprofen was used to treat pain after surgery in adults (aged over 18) and compared against: 
‐ a placebo (a control treatment, such as a bag of saline administered into a vein); or 
‐ another medicine.
What did we find? 
We found only one study which was suitable to include in our review. The study looked at the management of pain after bunionectomy. Bunionectomy is a surgery to remove a bunion at the base of the big toe. This study evaluated 201 people, mostly females. The study compared intravenous ibuprofen to: 
‐ a placebo; or
‐ another medicine, acetaminophen (paracetamol).
We were most interested in learning how many people had their pain reduced by 50% (half) or more within 4 or 6 hours of surgery.  
Pain reduction 
The study showed that:
‐ more people who received ibuprofen had their pain reduced by 50% (half) or more within 4 or 6 hours of surgery as compared to those who received placebo; and  
‐ there was little to no difference when ibuprofen was compared to another medicine, acetaminophen, i.e. the numbers of people with pain reduced by 50% (half) or more within 4 or 6 hours of surgery  
Need for extra pain medicines (rescue medication) 
Rescue medicine is an extra pain medication if the study medication is not treating the patient's pain well enough. The time (in minutes) to needing rescue medication was longer (delayed) with use of ibuprofen or acetaminophen than for those who received placebo.  
Adverse events 
There was not enough information in this study to assess side effects, but the rate at which they occurred appeared to be similar among all treatments. Very few patients dropped out because of side effects. This is usually the case in studies where patients are only in a study for a short period of time.  
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We only had results from one relatively small study. This limited our confidence in the evidence. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to June 2021.

## Plain Title
Can a Single Shot of Ibuprofen Help Adults with Pain After Surgery?

## Rationale

**What is pain after surgery?**
Pain is very common right after surgery. This pain usually happens within the first 6 hours after an operation. Doctors need to treat this pain to help patients feel better.

**How do doctors treat pain after surgery?**
Doctors often use two types of pain drugs together. One type is called opioids. Morphine is an opioid. The other type is called NSAIDs. These are drugs like aspirin or ibuprofen. NSAIDs help reduce swelling and pain.

**What problems can these drugs cause?**
Both types of drugs can cause problems. Opioids can make people feel sick. Some people may start to use too much of them. This is called opioid over-use disorder. NSAIDs like ibuprofen can also cause problems. They may cause bleeding at the surgery site. They may hurt the kidneys or stomach.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors need better ways to treat pain after surgery. They want to know if giving ibuprofen through a vein is safe and works well. This method might help patients who cannot swallow pills. Researchers wanted to see if the benefits of ibuprofen are greater than the risks.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked for studies that tested ibuprofen given through a vein. They searched medical records up to June 2021. They found only one study that met their needs.

**Who was in the study?**
The study included 201 adults. Most were women. All had surgery to remove a bunion. A bunion is a painful bump at the base of the big toe.

**What treatments did people get?**
Each person had an equal chance to get one of three treatments:
- Ibuprofen through a vein
- Acetaminophen through a vein (also called paracetamol)
- Placebo through a vein (salt water with no medicine)

This fair method is like flipping a coin. It helps make sure the results are trustworthy.

**How long were people in the study?**
People were watched for 4 to 6 hours after surgery. This is a short study.

## Results

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Researchers wanted to know how many people had their pain cut in half. They checked this at 4 hours and 6 hours after surgery.

**What were the main results?**

*Pain reduction:*
- More people who got ibuprofen had their pain cut in half compared to those who got placebo.
- Ibuprofen and acetaminophen worked about the same. Both helped reduce pain by half in similar numbers of people.

*Need for extra pain medicine:*
Some people needed extra pain medicine. This is called rescue medicine. People need it when their pain is still too strong. People who got ibuprofen or acetaminophen waited longer before needing rescue medicine. People who got placebo needed rescue medicine sooner.

*Side effects:*
The study did not have enough information about side effects. The side effects that did happen were similar in all three groups. Very few people left the study because of side effects. This is normal in short studies.

**What do the results mean?**
There is not enough evidence to say for sure if ibuprofen through a vein works well for pain after surgery. There is also not enough evidence to know if it causes serious harm.

**What are the problems with this evidence?**
Only one small study was found. This makes it hard to be confident about the results. More studies are needed.

**What is needed next?**
Future studies should include more patients. They should be well-designed. This will help doctors know if ibuprofen through a vein is a good choice for pain after surgery. More research is also needed to understand the risks.

**How current is this information?**
This evidence is current through June 2021."
10.1002-14651858.CD013268.pub2-pls.txt,"Statins for asthma
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of statins in people with asthma.
Background 
Asthma is a common chronic (persistent) airway disease. Asthma is caused by inflammation in the lungs and bronchoconstriction (tightening of the small tubes in the lungs in response to a trigger such as pollen or cold air). Inflammation and bronchoconstriction cause airflow obstruction (narrowing and blockage). People with asthma experience recurrent attacks of wheezing, difficultly in breathing, and chest tightness, with or without a cough. 
Statins are anti‐inflammatory medicines. We wanted to review the evidence for statins because the theory is that their anti‐inflammatory properties will help people with asthma. We wanted to discover whether using statin therapy was better or worse than other alternatives, such as usual care alone or different types of statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin). 
Study characteristics 
We found only one trial that assessed atorvastatin (a type of statin drug) and placebo (dummy treatment) in 60 adults with asthma over a period of 12 weeks. These people had chronic asthma (persistent airway disease) when they started treatment. 
Key results 
We found that the statin (atorvastatin) did not result in any clear improvement in lung function in people with asthma, but may be better in asthma control than the dummy drug. However, because there is only one trial, we cannot draw firm conclusions. 
The trial did not report on adverse effects or severe adverse effects (harms). We are uncertain whether statins may  have beneficial effects on relieving asthma or whether they may increase the risk of adverse events or non‐serious adverse events. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of very low certainty, so we cannot draw firm conclusions about whether statins are helpful and safe to be used by people with asthma. 
The evidence is current to 7 February 2020.
","# Plain Language Summary: Statins for Asthma

## Plain Title
Can Statin Drugs Help People with Asthma?

## Rationale

**What is asthma?**
Asthma is a long-term lung disease that many people have. When someone has asthma, the small tubes in their lungs get swollen and tight. This makes it hard for air to move in and out. 

**What causes asthma problems?**
Two main things happen in asthma:
- The lungs become swollen (this is called inflammation)
- The small tubes in the lungs squeeze tight when triggered by things like pollen or cold air

**What do people with asthma feel?**
People with asthma have attacks that come and go. During these attacks, they may:
- Wheeze (make a whistling sound when breathing)
- Have trouble breathing
- Feel tightness in their chest
- Cough

**Why study statins for asthma?**
Statins are drugs that fight swelling in the body. Doctors usually give statins to help with heart problems. Researchers wanted to test if statins could help asthma. The idea was that statins might reduce the swelling in the lungs. This could help people with asthma breathe better.

**Why was this study needed?**
Researchers wanted to find out if statins work better than other treatments for asthma. They also wanted to know if statins are safe for people with asthma to use.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was a review of research studies. The researchers looked for all studies that tested statins in people with asthma.

**What did they find?**
They found only one study to review. This study tested a statin drug called atorvastatin.

**Who was in the study?**
- 60 adults with asthma
- All had long-term asthma when they joined the study

**What did people in the study receive?**
- Some people got atorvastatin (the statin drug)
- Other people got a placebo (a dummy pill with no medicine)

**How long did the study last?**
The study lasted 12 weeks (about 3 months).

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The statin drug (atorvastatin) did not clearly improve how well the lungs worked. However, it might have helped people control their asthma better than the dummy pill.

**What about side effects?**
The study did not report information about harmful effects. We do not know if statins caused any problems for people in the study.

**What do these results mean?**
Because only one small study was found, we cannot be sure about the results. We need more research to know if statins really help people with asthma.

**Quality of the evidence**
The quality of the evidence was very low. This means we cannot trust the results enough to make firm decisions. We cannot say for sure whether:
- Statins help people with asthma
- Statins are safe for people with asthma to use

**What are the conclusions?**
More research is needed. Right now, we do not have enough good evidence to know if statins should be used to treat asthma. Doctors and patients should wait for more studies before using statins for asthma treatment.

**When was this review done?**
The researchers looked for studies up to February 7, 2020."
10.1002-14651858.CD013270.pub2-pls.txt,"Surgery on both eyes on the same day or on different days: which works better to treat cataract in both eyes? 
Key messages 
‐ Current evidence supports there may be no important difference between surgery on both eyes on the same day (ISBCS) and surgery on different days (DSBCS) for the following clinical outcomes: eye (ocular) infection (endophthalmitis, a severe, sight‐threatening but rare complication), spectacle correction after surgery (refraction), complications, vision with spectacle correction (if needed), and patient‐reported outcomes (PROMs; questionnaires on vision). 
‐ Current evidence supports the costs for ISBCS are lower compared to DSBCS, but evidence on the balance between the costs and how well it works (cost‐effectiveness) was lacking. 
‐ Overall, the amount and quality of the evidence was limited.
What is cataract and how is it treated? 
Age‐related cataract is a natural ageing process of the lens of the eye, in which the lens becomes cloudy and vision decreases. The only way to treat cataract is by surgery. During surgery, the clouded lens is removed and replaced by an artificial lens, implanted in the eye. Currently, most people undergo cataract surgery on both eyes on different days, with a period of days, weeks, or even months between surgeries, called delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery (DSBCS). However, it is also possible to have cataract surgery on both eyes on the same day, called immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS). 
Potential advantages to ISBCS include fewer visits to the hospital, faster visual recovery, and lower healthcare costs. However, there are also potential disadvantages, such as developing complications in both eyes. Also, in ISBCS, outcomes of the first eye cannot be used when performing second‐eye surgery, which may result in worse refractive outcomes (increased spectacle dependence). 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if cataract surgery on both eyes on the same day is as safe, effective, and cost‐effective as having surgery on both eyes on different days. 
What did we do?  
We searched for studies that looked at outcomes of ISBCS compared to DSBCS. We also searched for studies that looked at the balance between costs and outcomes for ISBCS compared to DSBCS (cost‐effectiveness). We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find?  
We found 14 studies that involved 276,260 people (7384 who had ISBCS and 268,876 who had DSBCS). The studies were conducted in Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Iran, (South) Korea, Spain (Canary Islands), Sweden, the UK, and the USA. Most studies lasted for around three months. 
Main results  
‐ Endophthalmitis: the type of surgery (ISBCS or DSBCS) may make little to no difference in the occurrence of endophthalmitis in one eye (up to six weeks after surgery). None of the studies reported endophthalmitis in both eyes, but this event is most likely too rare to be detected by these studies. 
‐ Refractive outcomes: there is probably little to no difference in refractive outcomes at one to three months after surgery with ISBCS compared to DSBCS. 
‐ Other complications: there may be little to no difference in other complications up to three months after surgery with ISBCS compared to DSBCS, but we are very uncertain about the results. 
‐ Costs: the economic studies in this review reported lower costs for ISBCS compared to DSBCS. One study reported that ISBCS is cost‐effective compared to DSBCS, but we are very uncertain about the results. 
‐ Best‐corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA; vision with spectacle correction if needed): the type of surgery (ISBCS or DSBCS) may have little to no effect on BCDVA at one to three months after surgery, but we are very uncertain about the results. 
‐ PROMs (measured in questionnaires): the type of surgery (ISBCS or DSBCS) probably makes little to no difference in PROMs at one to three months after surgery. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Overall, we had moderate to very little confidence in the evidence (endophthalmitis: little confidence, refractive outcomes: little to moderate confidence, complications: not confident, costs: little to no confidence, BCDVA: not confident, and PROMs: moderate confidence).  
Our confidence is limited because:
‐ the evidence on endophthalmitis was based on few cases of endophthalmitis;
‐ the studies assessed complications in different ways;
‐ there were not enough studies to be certain about refractive outcomes and complications;
‐ studies on costs reported costs for only one hospital and included different funding sources; 
‐ the studies assessed BCDVA in different ways and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results; 
‐ there were concerns regarding the possibility that people in the studies were aware of what treatment they were getting, and not all studies provided data about everything that we were interested in (most outcomes).  
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to 11 May 2021.
","# Plain Language Summary: Surgery on Both Eyes on the Same Day or Different Days for Cataracts

## Plain Title
Comparing Same-Day Surgery Versus Different-Day Surgery for Cataracts in Both Eyes

## Rationale

**What is a cataract?**
A cataract happens when the lens inside your eye gets cloudy as you age. This is a natural part of getting older. When you have a cataract, your vision gets worse and things look blurry or dim. Many older adults get cataracts in both eyes. This can make daily tasks hard to do, like reading, driving, or seeing faces clearly.

**How are cataracts treated?**
The only way to fix a cataract is with surgery. During the surgery, a doctor removes the cloudy lens. Then the doctor puts in a new, clear artificial lens. This helps you see better again.

**Two ways to do surgery on both eyes:**
Most people have surgery on one eye first. Then they wait days, weeks, or even months before having surgery on the other eye. This is called DSBCS (surgery on different days). But some people have surgery on both eyes on the same day. This is called ISBCS (surgery on the same day).

**Why did researchers do this study?**
Having surgery on both eyes the same day might have some good points. You would make fewer trips to the hospital. Your vision might get better faster. It might cost less money. But there might be some bad points too. If something goes wrong, it could affect both eyes. Also, doctors cannot use what they learn from the first eye to help with the second eye on the same day. This might mean you need stronger glasses after surgery.

Researchers wanted to find out if same-day surgery is as safe and works as well as different-day surgery. They also wanted to know which costs less.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this?**
Researchers looked for studies that compared same-day surgery to different-day surgery. They found 14 studies. These studies included 276,260 people total. Of these people, 7,384 had same-day surgery. The other 268,876 had different-day surgery.

**Who was in these studies?**
All the people in the studies had cataracts in both eyes. The studies included both men and women of different ages.

**Where did the studies take place?**
The studies happened in many countries. These included Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, Iran, Korea, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and the USA.

**How long did the studies last?**
Most studies followed people for about three months after surgery.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

**Eye infections:**
A serious eye infection called endophthalmitis can happen after cataract surgery. This infection is rare but very serious. It can cause blindness. The researchers found that same-day surgery and different-day surgery had similar rates of this infection in one eye. No studies found this infection in both eyes. But this infection is so rare that the studies might not have been big enough to find it.

**Need for glasses:**
About 1 to 3 months after surgery, people who had same-day surgery probably needed similar glasses as people who had different-day surgery. This means both types of surgery worked about the same for this outcome.

**Other problems:**
The studies looked at other problems that can happen during or after surgery. These might include swelling, bleeding, or other issues. Same-day surgery and different-day surgery seemed to have similar rates of these problems. But the researchers were not very sure about this finding.

**Cost:**
Same-day surgery cost less money than different-day surgery. This makes sense because you only go to the hospital once instead of twice. One study tried to see if same-day surgery was worth the cost. But the researchers were not very sure about these results.

**How well people could see:**
The researchers looked at how well people could see with glasses if they needed them. Both types of surgery seemed to work about the same. But the researchers were not very sure about this finding.

**What patients said:**
Researchers asked patients questions about their vision and how happy they were with their surgery. People who had same-day surgery and people who had different-day surgery gave similar answers. This means both groups were about equally happy with their results.

**What does this mean?**
Based on current evidence, same-day surgery seems to be as safe as different-day surgery. Both types of surgery work about the same. Same-day surgery costs less. But the researchers said they need more and better studies to be completely sure.

**Limitations:**
The researchers had some concerns about the evidence. Some studies were small. Different studies measured things in different ways. Some studies might have had bias. This means the researchers cannot be completely certain about all the findings. More research is needed."

Background 
Osteoarthritis of the hip or knee is a progressive disabling disease affecting many people worldwide. Although paracetamol is widely used as a treatment option for this condition, recent studies have called into question how effective this pain relief medication is. 
Search date 
This review includes all trials published up to 3 October 2017.
Study characteristics 
We included randomised clinical trials (where people are randomly put into one of two treatment groups) looking at the effects of paracetamol for people with hip or knee pain due to osteoarthritis against a placebo (a 'sugar tablet' that contains nothing that could act as a medicine). We found 10 trials with 3541 participants. On average, participants in the study were aged between 55 and 70 years, and most presented with knee osteoarthritis. The treatment dose ranged from 1.95 g/day to 4 g/day of paracetamol and participants were followed up between one and 12 weeks in all but one study, which followed people up for 24 weeks. Six trials were funded by companies that produced paracetamol. 
Key results 
Compared with placebo tablets, paracetamol resulted in little benefit at 12 weeks.
Pain (lower scores mean less pain) 
Improved by 3% (1% better to 5% better), or 3.2 points (1 better to 5.4 better) on a 0‐ to 100‐point scale. 
• People who took paracetamol reported that their pain improved by 26 points.
• People who took placebo reported that their pain improved by 23 points.
Physical function (lower scores mean better function) 
Improved by 3% (1% better to 5% better), or 2.9 points (1.0 better to 4.9 better) on a 0‐ to 100‐point scale. 
• People who took paracetamol reported that their function improved by 15 points.
• People who had placebo reported that their function improved by 12 points.
Side effects (up to 12 to 24 weeks) 
No more people had side effects with paracetamol (3% less to 3% more), or 0 more people out of 100. 
• 33 out of 100 people reported a side effect with paracetamol.
• 33 out of 100 people reported a side effect with placebo.
Serious side effects (up to 12 to 24 weeks) 
1% more people had serious side effects with paracetamol (0% less to 1% more), or one more person out of 100. 
• Two out of 100 people reported a serious side effect with paracetamol.
• One out of 100 people reported a serious side effect with placebo.
Withdrawals due to adverse events (up to 12 to 24 weeks) 
1% more people withdrew from treatment with paracetamol (1% less to 3% more), or one more person out of 100. 
• Eight out of 100 people withdrew from paracetamol treatment.
• Seven out of 100 people withdrew from placebo treatment.
Abnormal liver function tests (up to 12 to 24 weeks): 
5% more people had abnormal liver function tests (meaning there was some inflammation or damage to the liver) with paracetamol (1% more to 10% more), or five more people out of 100. 
• Seven out of 100 people had an abnormal liver function test with paracetamol.
• Two out of 100 people had an abnormal liver function test with placebo.
Quality of the evidence 
High‐quality evidence indicated that paracetamol provided only minimal improvements in pain and function for people with hip or knee osteoarthritis, with no increased risk of adverse events overall. None of the studies measured quality of life. Due to the small number of events, we were less certain if paracetamol use increased the risk of serious side effects, increased withdrawals due to side effects, and changed the rate of abnormal liver function tests. However, although there may be more abnormal liver function tests with paracetamol, the clinical implications are unknown. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Does Paracetamol Help People with Hip or Knee Osteoarthritis?

## Plain Title

Testing if Paracetamol Works for Hip and Knee Pain Caused by Osteoarthritis

## Rationale

**What is osteoarthritis?**

Osteoarthritis is a disease that affects the joints. It gets worse over time. Many people around the world have this disease in their hips or knees. It causes pain and makes it hard to move around. This can make daily activities difficult.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors often give paracetamol to people with hip or knee osteoarthritis. Paracetamol is a common pain medicine. Many people take it to feel better. But recent research made doctors wonder: Does paracetamol really help these patients? 

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to know if paracetamol truly helps reduce pain. They also wanted to see if it helps people move better. They compared paracetamol to a placebo. A placebo is a fake pill that looks real but has no medicine in it. This helps researchers see if the real medicine works.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 10 different studies. These studies included 3,541 people total. The researchers put people into two groups randomly. One group took paracetamol. The other group took placebo pills.

**Who was in the studies?**

Most people in the studies were between 55 and 70 years old. Most had knee osteoarthritis. Some had hip osteoarthritis.

**How much medicine did people take?**

People took between 1.95 grams and 4 grams of paracetamol each day.

**How long did the studies last?**

Most studies lasted between 1 week and 12 weeks. One study lasted 24 weeks.

## Results

**What did the researchers find about pain?**

Paracetamol helped pain a little bit. But the help was very small. Researchers measured pain on a scale from 0 to 100. Zero means no pain. One hundred means the worst pain possible.

People who took paracetamol felt 3 points better than people who took placebo. This is only a 3% improvement. Here is what happened:
- People taking paracetamol: Their pain improved by 26 points
- People taking placebo: Their pain improved by 23 points

The difference was only 3 points. This is a very small difference.

**What did the researchers find about movement?**

Paracetamol helped people move a little bit better. But again, the help was very small. Researchers measured movement on a scale from 0 to 100. Lower numbers mean better movement.

People who took paracetamol moved 3 points better than people who took placebo. This is only a 3% improvement. Here is what happened:
- People taking paracetamol: Their movement improved by 15 points
- People taking placebo: Their movement improved by 12 points

The difference was only 3 points. This is a very small difference.

**What about side effects?**

Side effects are unwanted problems caused by medicine. Researchers looked at several types of side effects.

**Regular side effects:** About the same number of people had side effects in both groups. Out of 100 people, 33 had side effects with paracetamol. Out of 100 people, 33 had side effects with placebo.

**Serious side effects:** These are side effects that are very bad. Slightly more people had serious side effects with paracetamol. Out of 100 people, 2 had serious side effects with paracetamol. Out of 100 people, 1 had serious side effects with placebo.

**Stopping treatment:** Some people stopped taking their pills because of side effects. Out of 100 people, 8 stopped taking paracetamol. Out of 100 people, 7 stopped taking placebo.

**Liver problems:** The liver is an organ that cleans your blood. Doctors did tests to check if the liver was working well. More people taking paracetamol had abnormal liver tests. Out of 100 people, 7 had abnormal tests with paracetamol. Out of 100 people, 2 had abnormal tests with placebo. Doctors are not sure what this means for patients' health.

**What do these results mean?**

The evidence from these studies was high quality. This means we can trust the results. Paracetamol gives only very small improvements in pain and movement. For most people, this small improvement may not make much difference in daily life. Paracetamol did not cause more side effects overall. But it may cause more liver test changes. More research is needed to understand this.

**What was not measured?**

None of the studies looked at quality of life. Quality of life means how good people feel about their daily lives."
10.1002-14651858.CD013276.pub2-pls.txt,"Physiological track‐and‐trigger/early warning systems for use in maternity care
What is the question? 
The aim of this review is to find out from randomised controlled trials if using simple monitoring tools are helpful in alerting to clinical problems and in reducing serious illness or death in pregnant women and in their first six weeks after birth. Examples of such tools are track and trigger systems or early warning systems kept by the bedside in maternity care. 
Why is this important? 
Many natural functional changes occur in a woman's body during pregnancy. As a result, a pregnant woman, who may appear healthy and well, can become rapidly very sick. This is called clinical deterioration. If not detected sufficiently early and treated successfully, the pregnant woman can become seriously ill or even die. Examples are serious bleeding, development of convulsions when a woman has high blood pressure, blood clots and serious infection. Simple bedside tools or charts can be used by maternity care providers (midwives and doctors) to record information on a woman's health. The recorded health measures include her blood pressure, pulse rate, breathing rate, body temperature, and other health measures such as urine output and mental alertness. The tools have been introduced so that the measures are observed, recorded and interpreted together, rather than as single measures. The intention is to detect when serious illness is, or might be developing. Medical staff can then step in to prevent serious harm.  
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence on 28 May 2021 and identified two studies that compared an early warning system with standard care. One study was a single‐centre study involving 700 women and the second was a stepped‐wedge cluster trial (multiple centres grouped into 'clusters') involving 536,233 women. Different clusters of centres introduced the tool over time until all centres were using the tool. Both studies were carried out in low‐resource healthcare settings. The tools were called the 'Saving Mothers Score' (SMS) and the CRADLE Vital Sign Alert (VSA) device. Risk of bias in the two studies was low or unclear.  
We found that the tools probably do not reduce maternal death. Women may have less serious bleeding (or haemorrhage) when an early warning tool is used. This finding was supported by low‐certainty evidence. We also found that the tools may make little or no difference to a potentially life‐threatening body response to infection (sepsis), to blood pressure with swelling, protein in the urine and convulsions (eclampsia), to a serious illness in pregnancy that affects the blood and the way the liver works (HELLP), or being admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). Use of the tools probably reduces the time a woman stays in hospital (moderate‐certainty evidence). We also found that the tools may make little or no difference to the death of the baby in the first month after birth (neonatal death). This finding was supported by low‐certainty evidence. Neither of the two included studies reported cost outcomes. 
What does this mean? 
Use of early warning tools for women in maternity care in low‐resource settings may reduce serious bleeding and probably reduces the number of days a woman stays in the hospital but may not reduce maternal or infant deaths. More studies are required on the different early warning systems in low‐resource settings. Studies are also needed in middle‐ and high‐resource settings, and in high‐ and low‐risk pregnant women. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Do Simple Monitoring Tools Help Prevent Serious Illness or Death in Pregnant Women?

## Rationale

**What happens during pregnancy?**
A woman's body goes through many natural changes during pregnancy. Because of these changes, a pregnant woman who looks healthy can become very sick very quickly. Doctors call this ""getting worse fast.""

**Why is this a problem?**
If health problems are not found early enough, pregnant women can become very ill or die. Some examples of serious problems include heavy bleeding, seizures (fits) from high blood pressure, blood clots, and bad infections.

**What might help?**
Simple tools or charts kept by the bedside can help nurses and doctors track a woman's health. These tools record important health signs like blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, body temperature, how much urine is passed, and how alert the woman is. These tools look at all the health signs together, not just one at a time. This helps spot when a woman might be getting sick.

**Why do this study?**
Researchers wanted to find out if these simple monitoring tools actually help prevent serious illness or death in pregnant women and new mothers (up to six weeks after birth).

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked for studies that tested these monitoring tools. They found two studies that compared using an early warning tool with regular care.

**Who was in the studies?**
One study included 700 women at one hospital. The other study was much larger, with 536,233 women at many different hospitals. Both studies took place in areas with fewer medical resources.

**What tools were tested?**
The two tools tested were called the ""Saving Mothers Score"" and the ""CRADLE Vital Sign Alert device.""

**How long did the studies last?**
The studies tracked women during pregnancy and up to six weeks after giving birth.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The studies showed that these monitoring tools:
- Probably do not reduce deaths of mothers
- May reduce serious bleeding in mothers
- Probably reduce how many days women stay in the hospital
- May not reduce deaths of babies in the first month after birth

The tools may make little or no difference to:
- Serious infections that spread through the body
- High blood pressure problems that cause seizures
- Serious liver and blood problems during pregnancy
- How many women need intensive care

**What does this mean for patients?**
Using these simple monitoring tools in areas with fewer medical resources may help reduce serious bleeding. They probably help women go home from the hospital sooner. However, they may not prevent deaths of mothers or babies.

**What do we still need to know?**
More studies are needed to test these tools in different settings. We need studies in areas with more medical resources and fewer medical resources. We also need studies that include women with high-risk pregnancies and low-risk pregnancies.

**Important note:**
The studies did not report how much these tools cost to use.

**Quality of the evidence:**
Some findings are based on moderate-quality evidence. This means we can be fairly confident in the results. Other findings are based on low-quality evidence. This means future studies might change what we know."
10.1002-14651858.CD013280.pub2-pls.txt,"Indocyanine green angiography versus clinical evaluation in preventing postoperative complications following breast reconstruction after mastectomy 
What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane review was to find out whether the use of a new imaging technique, called indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), during reconstructive breast surgery can reduce necrosis (cell death) of the overlying breast skin and other complications such as infections, following reconstructive breast surgery after mastectomy.  We included women who had undergone skin‐sparing mastectomy (that is, where the whole breast including nipple is removed, sparing the overlying breast skin) for breast cancer or women who were at high risk of developing breast cancer (because of faulty genes). We collected and analysed all relevant studies to provide a review that will inform doctors and patients on ICGA use in reconstructive breast surgery.  Key messages The use of ICGA during reconstructive breast surgery seems to reduce the chance of reoperations when compared to clinical evaluation only. We are uncertain about the effect of ICGA on reducing the chance of necrosis of the overlying breast skin and other post‐surgery complications when compared to clinical evaluation only. The quality of studies used for this review is very low, meaning that we are not confident of the results. We need high‐quality studies that have randomised women to a group of ICGA assessment or clinical evaluation alone to have a more definitive answer.  What was studied in the review? Around 40% of women with breast cancer need to undergo mastectomy (removal of the whole breast). A skin‐sparing mastectomy is a common operation in which the overlying breast skin is preserved. After skin‐sparing mastectomy, women have the option to undergo reconstructive breast surgery. This operation carries some risks and complications, including an operation to correct complications (reoperation), spontaneous reopening of the surgical wound (dehiscence), infection, blood pooling outside of a blood vessel (haematoma) and a pocket filled with blood plasma underneath the skin (seroma).  Preserving the blood supply of the overlying breast skin during skin‐sparing mastectomy is crucial. When the blood supply is poor, skin will not survive, and surgeons need to intervene to prevent postoperative complications. Usually, the surgeon will assess tissue colour, the time taken for colour to return to the skin after pressure is applied (capillary refill), temperature, skin’s elasticity, and bleeding of the skin.  ICGA is a new imaging technique that assesses the blood supply to the tissue. It can assess blood flow in the overlying breast skin better than clinical judgement alone. We collected studies that compared the use of ICGA to clinical evaluation by a surgeon during immediate reconstructive breast surgery after skin‐sparing mastectomy. In these studies, women underwent immediate reconstructive surgery with their own tissue from another area of the woman’s body or with a breast implant.  What are the main results of this review? We found nine studies that compared the number of postoperative complications in women who had ICGA assessment of their breast skin versus clinical evaluation. Six studies were performed in the USA, two in Denmark and one in Japan. There were a total 1589 women with 2199 breast reconstructions. Studies reported the number of complications on a per patient basis or on a per breast basis. We present information based on both types of data.  The main results on a per patient analysis were that: ‐ICGA may reduce reoperation rates, and ‐we are uncertain as to whether ICGA has an effect on necrosis of the overlying skin of the breast, infection, haematoma and seroma rates. 
The main results on a per breast basis were that: ‐ICGA may reduce necrosis of the overlying skin of the breast, reoperation and infection rates, and ‐we are uncertain as to whether ICGA has an effect on haematoma and seroma rates.  The evidence contributing to this review topic is considered to be very low quality. Since randomised controlled trials are found to be one of the most powerful methods in clinical research, it is a major downside that these studies are missing. We emphasise the need for randomised controlled trials to further investigate the use of ICGA in reconstructive breast surgery.  How up‐to‐date is this review? Studies published up to April 2019 have been used for this review. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Using a Special Camera During Breast Reconstruction Surgery to Prevent Problems After the Operation

## Rationale

**What is breast reconstruction surgery?**

About 4 out of 10 women with breast cancer need surgery to remove their whole breast. This is called a mastectomy. Some women can have a special type of mastectomy where doctors remove the breast tissue but keep the skin that covers the breast. This is called skin-sparing mastectomy.

After this surgery, women can choose to have their breast rebuilt. This is called breast reconstruction. Doctors can rebuild the breast using tissue from another part of the woman's body or by using a breast implant.

**What problems can happen after this surgery?**

This surgery can cause problems. Some women may need another surgery to fix issues. The surgical cut may open up on its own. Some women get infections. Blood may pool under the skin. The breast skin may die because it does not get enough blood flow.

**Why is blood flow important?**

The skin covering the breast needs good blood flow to stay healthy. When blood flow is poor, the skin can die. Doctors need to find this problem early to prevent complications.

Usually, doctors check the skin by looking at its color and temperature. They press on the skin to see how fast the color comes back. They check if the skin bleeds and feels normal.

**What is the new technique being studied?**

A new camera technique called indocyanine green angiography (or ICGA for short) can show doctors how blood flows through the breast skin. This special camera may help doctors see blood flow problems better than just looking at the skin with their eyes.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if using this special camera during surgery helps prevent problems after breast reconstruction. They wanted to see if it works better than doctors just looking at the skin with their eyes.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This is a review study. Researchers looked at 9 different studies that were already done. They combined the results to see what they could learn.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included 1,589 women who had 2,199 breast reconstructions. Some women had both breasts reconstructed.

These women had breast cancer or were at high risk of getting breast cancer because of their genes. All women had skin-sparing mastectomy followed by breast reconstruction right away.

**Where were the studies done?**

Six studies were done in the United States. Two studies were done in Denmark. One study was done in Japan.

**What did researchers compare?**

Researchers compared two groups of women. One group had the special camera used during their surgery. The other group had doctors check their breast skin using only their eyes and hands.

**When were these studies done?**

The review looked at all studies published up to April 2019.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The special camera may help reduce the need for another surgery to fix problems. This was seen when researchers counted each patient once.

The special camera may also help reduce skin death, the need for another surgery, and infections. This was seen when researchers counted each breast separately.

Researchers are not sure if the special camera helps with other problems. These include blood pooling under the skin or fluid pockets under the skin.

**What does this mean for patients?**

The special camera might help prevent some problems after breast reconstruction surgery. However, we cannot be completely sure about these results.

**Why are we not sure about the results?**

The quality of the studies was very low. This means we cannot fully trust the results. The studies were not done in the best way to answer this question.

None of the studies randomly assigned women to get the special camera or not. Random assignment is the best way to make sure the groups are fair to compare.

**What is needed next?**

We need better studies to know for sure if this special camera helps. These studies should randomly assign women to different groups. This will give us more certain answers about whether the special camera truly helps prevent problems after breast reconstruction surgery.

**Conclusion**

The special camera shows promise for helping prevent problems after breast reconstruction surgery. But we need better research before doctors can be sure it works.

Review question 
We examined the effects of various routes of glucose administration as a first‐aid treatment in people with suspected or symptomatic hypoglycaemia. 
Background 
Hypoglycaemia, or having low blood sugar levels, is a common occurrence in people with diabetes but may also occur in other persons due to an imbalance in blood sugar regulation. Symptoms of mild or moderate hypoglycaemia are for example, shakiness, dizziness, sweating or nervousness, First aid for this condition is usually self‐administered but is often provided by family or friends, and glucose tablets compared with dietary forms of sugar such as juice, candies or dried fruit strips have shown to result in a better resolution of symptoms. Glucose can be given orally (swallowed), but also inside the cheek against the buccal mucosa (‘buccal administration’), under the tongue (‘sublingual administration’) or via the rectal route. In the latter three ways of treatment, the glucose is not being swallowed as with the oral route. 
Study characteristics 
We identified four studies. One randomised study (clinical trials where people are randomly allocated to one of two or more treatment groups) compared sublingual glucose administration, in the form of table sugar, with an oral administration in 42 hypoglycaemic children between one and 15 years old. Two non‐randomised studies compared buccal glucose administration with oral administration in 23 adult healthy fasting volunteers. One randomised study compared a dextrose gel with oral administration of glucose in 18 people with type 1 diabetes and hypoglycaemia. 
Key results 
Providing sugar under the tongue (sublingual) resulted in a greater rise in blood glucose after 20 minutes than giving the sugar orally, but this was in a specific setting including children with hypoglycaemia and symptoms of concomitant malaria or respiratory tract infection. On the other hand, giving glucose by the buccal mucosa route resulted in a lower plasma glucose concentration than with the oral route. For dextrose gel (where uptake of the glucose occurs through a combination of oral swallowing and via the buccal mucosa), no clear benefit was shown compared to oral glucose administration (glucose tablets or glucose solutions). Most studies did not report on time to resolution of symptoms, resolution of hypoglycaemia as defined by blood glucose levels above a certain threshold, time to resolution of hypoglycaemia, adverse events, and treatment delay. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The evidence is of very low certainty due to limitations in study design, few studies and small number of participants in the studies, and because half of the studies were performed with healthy volunteers rather than in people with characteristic hypoglycaemia. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Ways to Give Sugar to People with Low Blood Sugar

## Rationale

**What is low blood sugar?**
Low blood sugar, also called hypoglycaemia, happens when sugar levels in the blood drop too low. This happens most often in people with diabetes. It can also happen in other people when their body cannot control blood sugar well.

**What does low blood sugar feel like?**
People with low blood sugar may feel shaky or dizzy. They may sweat a lot or feel nervous. These symptoms can be scary and uncomfortable. People need quick help when this happens.

**Why did researchers do this study?**
When someone has low blood sugar, they need sugar fast. Usually, the person takes sugar themselves. Sometimes family or friends help them. Sugar can be given in different ways. Most people swallow sugar by mouth. But sugar can also be placed inside the cheek, under the tongue, or even through the rectum. Researchers wanted to know which way works best. They wanted to find the fastest way to raise blood sugar. This could help people feel better sooner.

**Why is this study important?**
Finding the best way to give sugar could help many people. It could help people with diabetes stay safer. It could also help their families know what to do.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers set up this study?**
Researchers looked at four different studies. They compared the results from all four studies.

**Who was in these studies?**
The studies included different types of people:
- One study had 42 children between ages 1 and 15. These children had low blood sugar. They also had malaria or lung infections.
- Two studies had 23 healthy adults. These adults had not eaten for a while.
- One study had 18 adults with type 1 diabetes. They had low blood sugar.

**What did the studies compare?**
The studies looked at different ways to give sugar:
- Placing table sugar under the tongue versus swallowing it
- Placing glucose inside the cheek versus swallowing it
- Using a glucose gel versus swallowing glucose tablets or liquid

**How long did the studies last?**
The studies measured blood sugar for short periods. Most checked blood sugar after 20 minutes.

## Results

**What did researchers find?**
The results were mixed. No single method worked best for everyone.

In children with infections, sugar under the tongue raised blood sugar more than swallowing sugar. This happened after 20 minutes. But this was only tested in children who were also sick with other illnesses.

When glucose was placed inside the cheek, blood sugar did not rise as much. Swallowing glucose worked better in this case.

Glucose gel did not work clearly better than swallowing glucose tablets or liquid. The gel is absorbed partly through the cheek and partly by swallowing.

**What information was missing?**
Most studies did not measure important things. They did not report how fast symptoms went away. They did not check how long it took for blood sugar to return to normal. They did not report side effects or problems. They did not measure delays in treatment.

**How strong is this evidence?**
The evidence is very weak. There are several problems:
- Only four small studies were found
- The studies had very few people in them
- Two studies used healthy people, not people with actual low blood sugar
- The study designs had limitations

**What do these results mean?**
Researchers cannot say which method works best. More and better studies are needed. For now, people should follow their doctor's advice. Swallowing glucose tablets remains a common and effective choice."
10.1002-14651858.CD013285.pub2-pls.txt,"Exercise versus airway clearance for people with cystic fibrosis
Review question 
Can exercise replace other methods of airway clearance for people with cystic fibrosis (CF)? 
Background 
CF affects many systems in the body, mainly the respiratory system. It causes a build‐up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs which causes irritation and damage to the lining of the airways. CF treatment involves chest physiotherapy, also called airway clearance, which uses a range of devices or techniques to get rid of this mucus. It has been suggested that exercise may have a similar effect. Exercising results in a person taking different volumes and depths of breaths. This leads to pressure changes and forces within the airways that move secretions out of the lungs. We compared the effect on lung function of exercise versus other techniques, to see if exercise is a suitable alternative for people with CF. We wanted to answer our review question to potentially reduce their treatment burden. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to 15 February 2022.
Study characteristics 
We searched the literature for studies where people received at least two treatment sessions of exercise or another airway clearance technique, and report on four studies including 86 people with CF in the review. The people in the studies were aged between 7 and 41 years and had varying degrees of disease severity. Three studies included people who were clinically well and one study included people admitted to hospital for a chest infection. The studies lasted between four days and six months and compared exercise (alone or in combination with another airway clearance technique) to other techniques. Two studies compared exercise with postural drainage and percussion (PD&P), one study compared exercise with the active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) and one study compared exercise with underwater positive expiratory pressure (uPEP), also known as bubble PEP. Three studies received financial support from funding bodies such as the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, the Buffalo Foundation and the Romanian National Council for Scientific Research in Higher Education. 
Key results 
We did not find enough evidence to conclude whether or not exercise can replace other methods of airway clearance. We did not find any evidence to suggest that exercise was either better or worse than other methods to improve lung function or clear mucus from the airways, although exercising did improve people's exercise ability, and it was the preferred choice of treatment in one study. None of the studies reported any negative effects of exercise therapy. None of the studies evaluated quality of life or the need for extra antibiotic treatment. One study did suggest that exercise alone was less effective at clearing sputum than ACBT. 
Exercise versus ACBT 
One study (18 participants) found that a measure of lung function temporarily (up to 30 minutes) increased in the exercise group only, otherwise there was no difference between the ACBT or the exercise group. No adverse events were reported, and it is not certain if ACBT was thought to be more effective or was preferred. The exercise group produced less sputum than the ACBT group. The study did not report on exercise capacity, quality of life, adherence, hospitalisations and need for additional antibiotics. 
Exercise plus PD&P versus PD&P alone 
Two studies (55 participants) compared exercise plus PD&P to PD&P alone. At two weeks, one trial described a greater increase in lung function with PD&P alone, while at six months the second study reported a greater increase with exercise plus PD&P (but did not provide data for the PD&P group). One study reported no side effects at all, and also reported no difference between groups in exercise capacity (maximal work rate), sputum volume or the average length of time spent in hospital. Conversely, the second study reported fewer hospitalisations due to exacerbations in the exercise and PD&P group. Neither study reported on quality of life, preference and the need for antibiotics. 
Exercise versus uPEP 
One study (13 participants) compared exercise to uPEP (also known as bubble PEP). No adverse events were recorded in either group and investigators reported that those taking part thought that, while exercise was more tiring, it was also more enjoyable than bubble PEP. We found no differences in the total weight of sputum collected during treatment sessions. The study did not report on lung function, quality of life, exercise capacity, adherence, need for antibiotics or hospitalisations. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Overall, we had very little confidence in the evidence because all four studies had few participants and two studies only presented results as a shortened report given at a conference.  
We do not think the fact that participants and people measuring the outcomes knew which treatment the participants were receiving influenced the results of outcomes such as lung function and sputum weight. We do not think the fact that these studies were financed should influence the interpretation of the results in this review.  
","# Plain Language Summary: Can Exercise Replace Other Ways to Clear Mucus from the Lungs in People with Cystic Fibrosis?

## Plain Title

Can Exercise Replace Other Breathing Treatments for People with Cystic Fibrosis?

## Rationale

**What is cystic fibrosis?**

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease that affects many parts of the body. It mainly affects the lungs. People with CF make thick, sticky mucus in their lungs. This mucus causes problems and can damage the airways.

**What is the current treatment?**

People with CF need chest therapy every day. This is also called airway clearance. It helps get rid of the mucus. There are many ways to clear mucus. Some use special devices. Others use breathing techniques. These treatments take a lot of time each day.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors wanted to know if exercise could work as well as other mucus-clearing methods. When people exercise, they breathe in different ways. They take deeper breaths and faster breaths. This creates pressure changes in the airways. These changes might help move mucus out of the lungs.

If exercise works as well as other treatments, it could help reduce treatment time. This would make life easier for people with CF. Exercise also has other health benefits.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked for studies that compared exercise to other airway clearance methods. They found four studies to review. These studies included 86 people with CF in total.

**Who was in the studies?**

The people in the studies were between 7 and 41 years old. They had different levels of disease. Some were mildly affected. Others were more severely affected. Most people in the studies were feeling well. One study included people in the hospital with a chest infection.

**What did the studies compare?**

The studies compared exercise to different treatments:
- Two studies compared exercise plus postural drainage and percussion (PD&P) to PD&P alone
- One study compared exercise to active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT)
- One study compared exercise to underwater positive expiratory pressure (uPEP), also called bubble PEP

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies lasted from four days to six months. People received at least two treatment sessions.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The researchers could not find enough proof to say if exercise can replace other mucus-clearing methods.

**Lung function:**

The studies did not show that exercise was better or worse than other methods for lung function. Lung function is how well the lungs work.

**Mucus clearance:**

The studies did not show clear differences in how much mucus was cleared. One study found that exercise alone cleared less mucus than ACBT.

**Exercise ability:**

Exercise did improve how well people could exercise. This is an important benefit.

**What people preferred:**

In one study, people said they liked exercise better. They said it was more tiring but also more fun than bubble PEP.

**Safety:**

None of the studies found any bad effects from exercise. This means exercise appears to be safe.

**What was not measured:**

The studies did not look at quality of life. They did not look at whether people needed extra antibiotics. Most studies did not look at hospital stays.

**Why is the evidence limited?**

The researchers had very little confidence in these results. This is because:
- All four studies had very few people in them
- Two studies only shared short reports from conferences
- More research is needed with more people

**What does this mean?**

Exercise appears to be safe for people with CF. It may help improve exercise ability. However, there is not enough proof yet to say it can replace other airway clearance methods. People with CF should talk to their doctor before changing their treatment plan.

More studies with more people are needed. These studies should look at lung function, mucus clearance, quality of life, and what people prefer."
10.1002-14651858.CD013287.pub2-pls.txt,"Is extending the treatment time by specialist mental health teams better for people with recent‐onset psychosis? 
What is psychosis? 
Psychosis describes conditions affecting the mind, in which people have trouble distinguishing what is real from what is not real. This might involve seeing or hearing things that other people cannot see or hear (hallucinations), or believing things that are not true (delusions). The combination of hallucinations and delusional thinking can cause severe distress and a change in behaviour. A first episode psychosis is the first time a person experiences an episode of psychosis. Recent‐onset psychosis is the first few years of the illness after someone experiences it for the first time. 
Psychosis is treatable 
Many people recover from a first episode and never experience another psychotic episode.
Early intervention teams specialise in treating recent‐onset psychosis, and aim to treat psychosis as quickly and intensively as possible. Intensive, early treatment of psychosis may help more people to continue with their treatment and to recover. 
Early intervention treatment usually lasts for two or three years. After early intervention treatment, a person will be cared for by their doctor or by standard community mental health professionals. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out if longer treatment (for up to 5 years) by specialist early intervention teams was more successful at treating recent‐onset psychosis than the usual two or three years of treatment followed by treatment by non‐specialist teams. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at the use of longer treatment of recent‐onset psychosis by specialist early intervention teams. 
We looked for randomised controlled studies, in which the treatments people received were decided at random. This type of study usually gives the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. 
We wanted to find out, at the end of the treatment:
‐ how many people recovered;
‐ how many people stopped their treatment too soon;
‐ how many people were admitted to a psychiatric hospital, and for how long;
‐ people's psychotic symptoms and functioning (how well they cope with daily life); and 
‐ how many people died.
Search date: we included evidence published up to 22 October 2019. 
What we found 
We found three studies conducted in Denmark, Canada and Hong Kong in 780 people (55% men; average age 20 to 25 years). 
The studies compared longer treatment (up to 5 years) with standard treatment (up to 3 years) by an early intervention team followed by treatment as usual (by their doctor or community mental health professionals). 
What are the results of our review? 
We found no difference between standard treatment and longer treatment by an early intervention team in the numbers of people who recovered (assessed by remission of symptoms; 3 studies; 780 people). 
Fewer people may stop their treatment too soon during longer treatment than standard treatment (2 studies; 380 people). 
There may be no difference between standard treatment and longer treatment for how many people are admitted to a psychiatric hospital (1 study; 160 people), or for how long they stay in hospital (1 study; 400 people). 
Longer treatment may reduce psychotic symptoms more than standard treatment (1 study; 156 people); but may not improve people's functioning (2 studies; 560 people). 
We are uncertain about whether longer treatment reduces the number of people who died, compared with standard treatment, because so few deaths were reported in the studies (3 studies; 780 people). 
How reliable are these results? 
Our results are likely to change when more evidence becomes available. We are not confident that longer treatment affects how many people stop treatment too soon, how many are admitted to hospital and how long they stay in hospital. 
We are uncertain about the effect of longer treatment on how many people recover, people's psychotic symptoms and functioning, and on the number of people who die. These results will change when more evidence becomes available. 
Key messages 
Longer treatment of recent‐onset psychosis by specialist mental health teams may lead to fewer people stopping their treatment early. However, we need more evidence before we can be certain about whether longer treatment is better overall than the usual two‐ or three‐year treatment.

## Plain Title
Does Longer Care from Special Mental Health Teams Help People Who Recently Had Psychosis?

## Rationale

**What is psychosis?**
Psychosis is a mental health problem. People with psychosis have trouble knowing what is real. They may see or hear things that are not there. These are called hallucinations. They may also believe things that are not true. These are called delusions. Psychosis can be very upsetting. It can change how a person acts.

**What is recent-onset psychosis?**
This means the first few years after someone has psychosis for the first time. Many people get better after their first time having psychosis. They may never have it again.

**How is psychosis treated?**
Special teams called early intervention teams treat people who recently had psychosis. These teams give strong treatment right away. Quick treatment may help more people get better. These special teams usually treat people for 2 or 3 years. After that, regular doctors or other mental health workers take over care.

**Why did we do this study?**
We wanted to know if longer care from special teams works better. We looked at care lasting up to 5 years. We compared this to the usual 2 or 3 years of special care followed by regular care.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**
We looked for studies that tested longer treatment times. We found 3 studies. These studies were done in Denmark, Canada, and Hong Kong. The studies included 780 people total. About half were men. Most people were 20 to 25 years old. All had recent-onset psychosis.

The studies used random selection. This means people were put into groups by chance. One group got longer care from special teams (up to 5 years). The other group got standard care (up to 3 years from special teams, then regular care).

**What did we measure?**
We looked at several things:
- How many people got better
- How many people quit treatment early
- How many people went to a psychiatric hospital
- How long people stayed in the hospital
- How bad their psychosis symptoms were
- How well people managed daily life
- How many people died

We used studies published up to October 2019.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

We found that longer care and standard care worked about the same for most things we measured.

**Getting better:** About the same number of people got better in both groups. This was true in all 3 studies with 780 people.

**Quitting treatment early:** Fewer people may quit treatment early with longer care. This was seen in 2 studies with 380 people. But we need more proof to be sure.

**Hospital stays:** About the same number of people went to the hospital in both groups. This was in 1 study with 160 people. People stayed in the hospital for about the same time in both groups. This was in 1 study with 400 people.

**Symptoms:** Longer care may reduce psychosis symptoms more than standard care. This was in 1 study with 156 people. But we need more proof.

**Daily life:** Both types of care helped people manage daily life about the same. This was in 2 studies with 560 people.

**Deaths:** Very few people died in the studies. We cannot tell if longer care makes a difference for deaths.

**How sure are we?**
We are not very sure about these results. We need more studies to know for certain. Our answers may change when we have more information.

**What does this mean?**
Longer care from special mental health teams may help some people stay in treatment. But we do not know yet if 5 years of special care is better overall than 2 or 3 years. More research is needed to find the best way to help people with recent-onset psychosis."
10.1002-14651858.CD013297.pub2-pls.txt,"What are the benefits and risks of surgery for epiretinal membrane (a disease of the eye)? 
Why is this question important?An epiretinal membrane is an abnormal layer of tissue that develops at the back of the eye. It affects around one in five people aged 75 years and older. In most people, the development of an epiretinal membrane is linked to the normal ageing processes in the eye and is described as 'idiopathic'. In other instances, epiretinal membrane is caused by a pre‐existing condition affecting the retina, such as inflammation or poor circluation. Epiretinal membrane can also develop after eye surgery. 
Epiretinal membrane typically forms over the part of the eye responsible for seeing fine detail (the macula). In some people, this does not affect vision. In others, it causes distorted or blurred vision, which can affect people’s quality of life. For example, an epiretinal membrane may impair people’s ability to read or drive. 
If an epiretinal membrane affects vision, it is commonly removed by surgery. A local anaesthetic (medication) is used to numb the eye area. As with any procedure, this surgery carries risks of harm from side effects. These include potential problems such as cataract, detached retina, infection and bleeding in the eye. 
To understand when the benefits of surgery outweigh its risks, we reviewed the research evidence. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?First, we searched the medical literature for studies: 
‐ in which epiretinal membrane was not caused by a pre‐existing condition or surgery;
‐ that compared the effects of surgery against no surgery or a placebo (sham) procedure; and 
‐ where people were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a group that underwent surgery for epiretinal membrane, and a group that did not have surgery for epiretinal membrane. 
We then summarised the evidence and rated our confidence in it, based on factors such as study methods and size. 
What did we find?We found only one study that met our criteria. This study took place in Denmark and included 53 people who had epiretinal membranes causing mild impairment of sight. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Those in one group had immediate surgery. Those in the other group were watched closely and in the event of any deterioration in their condition were invited to have surgery. People in both groups were followed up for one year. 
The study results suggest that immediate surgery for epiretinal membrane causing mild impairment of sight: 
‐ may not benefit vision 12 months after surgery; and
‐ may not lead to serious unwanted effects. One person treated with immediate surgery experienced an unwanted effect that was not considered serious. This was the development of an eye condition caused by fluid building up at the back of the eye. 
The study did not investigate the impact of surgery on participants’ quality of life.
How confident are we in the evidence?We are not confident in the evidence, because: 
‐ it is based on one small study; and
‐ some of the methods used by the researchers who conducted it may have introduced errors in its results. 
What does this mean?For epiretinal membrane causing severe disabling impairment of sight, we found no carefully‐controlled study that measured the effect of surgery. For severe epiretinal membrane, surgery is widely considered to improve the outcome and is routine practice. A carefully controlled trial comparing surgery to no treatment is considered unecessary and ethically inappropriate. 
For epiretinal membrane causing mild impairment of sight, however, the effect of surgery is uncertain. There is some evidence that the outcome of watchful waiting may be as good as the effect of immediate surgery. However, the evidence is not strong enough to draw firm conclusions. Further studies that use robust methods and measure outcomes including quality of life in the longer term would help to determine effect of surgery with more confidence. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to May 2020. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Surgery for Epiretinal Membrane

## Plain Title
Does surgery help people with epiretinal membrane, a condition that affects vision in older adults?

## Rationale

**What is epiretinal membrane?**

Epiretinal membrane is an extra layer of tissue that grows at the back of the eye. It affects about 1 in 5 people who are 75 years old or older. This tissue usually forms over a part of the eye called the macula. The macula helps you see fine details clearly.

**What causes this condition?**

In most people, epiretinal membrane happens as a normal part of getting older. Doctors call this ""idiopathic,"" which means it happens on its own. Sometimes it can be caused by other eye problems like swelling or poor blood flow. It can also happen after eye surgery.

**How does it affect people?**

Some people with epiretinal membrane have no vision problems. Other people have blurred or distorted vision. This can make daily tasks hard. For example, reading or driving may become difficult. This affects their quality of life.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors often remove epiretinal membrane with surgery when it affects vision. During surgery, doctors numb the eye area with medicine. But surgery can cause problems. These problems include cataracts, detached retina, infection, and bleeding in the eye. Researchers wanted to know when surgery helps more than it harms.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

Researchers looked for studies that tested surgery for epiretinal membrane. They wanted studies where:
- The condition happened naturally with aging
- Some people had surgery and others did not
- People were randomly put into different groups

They found only one study that met their needs. This study took place in Denmark. It included 53 people with mild vision problems from epiretinal membrane.

**Who was in the study?**

The study included adults with epiretinal membrane causing mild vision loss.

**What happened in the study?**

Researchers divided people into two groups randomly. One group had surgery right away. The other group was watched closely. If their vision got worse, they could have surgery later. Researchers followed both groups for one year.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The study found that for people with mild vision problems:
- Surgery right away may not improve vision after 12 months
- Surgery may not cause serious side effects
- One person who had surgery had fluid build up at the back of the eye. This was not considered serious.

The study did not look at how surgery affected quality of life.

**What does this mean for patients?**

For people with severe vision loss from epiretinal membrane, researchers found no studies. This is because surgery clearly helps these patients. Doctors consider it wrong not to offer surgery to people with severe vision loss.

For people with mild vision loss, the results are unclear. Waiting and watching may work as well as having surgery right away. But the evidence is not strong enough to be sure.

**How confident are the researchers?**

The researchers are not very confident in the evidence because:
- Only one small study was found
- Some methods used in the study may have caused errors

**What is needed next?**

More studies are needed. These studies should:
- Use better methods
- Include more people
- Follow people for longer periods
- Measure quality of life

**How current is this information?**

This review includes evidence up to May 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD013298.pub2-pls.txt,"What medicines, taken by mouth or given as an injection, work best to treat severe allergic eye disease in children and young people under 16 years old? 
What is allergic eye disease? An immune response is how the body recognises and defends itself against substances that appear harmful, usually by producing specific blood proteins (antibodies) against them. An allergy is a reaction by the body's immune system to a particular substance (an allergen) that is usually harmless, such as grass or tree pollens in the air. Different allergens affect different tissues, and their effects can be mild or serious. 
In the eye, allergic reactions can cause conjunctivitis: the conjunctiva (the tissue covering the white of the eye and lining the inside of the eyelids) becomes swollen and sore. Severe allergic eye disease may also affect the cornea (the clear, front part of the eye), causing keratoconjunctivitis. 
Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) are rare types of severe allergic eye disease. VKC usually develops in children and is more common in boys; AKC can affect children and adults. These conditions usually affect both eyes and make them red, itchy, sore, watery and sensitive to light. Both conditions can damage the cornea, which can affect eyesight and lead to blindness. Treatment is essential to save eyesight. 
Treatments for severe allergic eye disease Both conditions are treated with medicines that try to block the allergic reaction and reduce swelling. Symptoms may get better with medicines given as eye drops, but if these don't work, other medicines may be taken by mouth or given as an injection (systemic medicines). Systemic medicines that are often used to treat severe allergic eye disease include ones that target or suppress the immune response, such as anti‑inflammatory medicines and antibodies. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review We wanted to find out which systemic treatments work best for severe allergic eye disease in children and young people. 
What did we do?We searched for studies that looked at systemic medicines to treat severe allergic eye disease in children and young people under 16 years of age. We wanted to find studies that compared a single medicine with a placebo (dummy) medicine, or studies that compared two or more medicines against each other. 
We looked for randomised controlled studies, in which the treatments people received were decided at random, because these studies usually give the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. 
Search date: We searched for evidence published up to 17 February 2020. 
What we foundWe found no randomised controlled studies in children and young people with severe allergic eye disease treated by systemic medicines. 
Conclusions 
There is no evidence from randomised controlled studies about how well systemic medicines work for severe allergic eye disease in children and young people aged under 16 years. 
Research is needed to investigate how well systemic medicines work to treat severe allergic eye disease in children and young people, and to learn about any unwanted effects these medicines might cause. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Do medicines taken by mouth or injection help treat severe eye allergies in children? A review of the research

## Rationale

### What is severe allergic eye disease?

An allergy happens when the body reacts to something that is usually harmless. Common allergens include grass and tree pollen. The body tries to fight these substances even though they are not dangerous.

When allergies affect the eyes, they can cause problems. The white part of the eye and the inside of the eyelids can become red and swollen. This is called conjunctivitis.

Some children get very severe eye allergies. Two rare types are called VKC and AKC. These conditions usually affect both eyes. They make the eyes red, itchy, sore, and watery. The eyes also become very sensitive to light.

### Why is this condition a problem?

These severe eye allergies can damage the clear front part of the eye. This damage can harm a child's eyesight. In some cases, it can lead to blindness. Treatment is very important to protect eyesight.

### Why was this study needed?

Doctors usually treat severe eye allergies with eye drops first. But sometimes eye drops do not work well enough. When this happens, doctors may use other medicines. These medicines are taken by mouth or given as a shot.

The researchers wanted to find out which of these medicines work best. They wanted to help doctors choose the right treatment for children with severe eye allergies.

## Trial Design

### How did the researchers look for answers?

The researchers searched for studies about medicines for severe eye allergies. They looked for studies in children and young people under 16 years old.

They wanted to find studies that compared:
- One medicine against a fake medicine (called a placebo)
- Two or more different medicines against each other

They looked for a special type of study. In these studies, patients are put into groups by chance. This type of study gives the most reliable results.

The researchers searched for all studies published up to February 17, 2020.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

The researchers found no studies that met their requirements. They could not find any studies that tested these medicines in the right way. There were no studies in children and young people under 16 years old.

### What does this mean?

Right now, there is no reliable research evidence about these medicines. Doctors do not have good information about:
- How well these medicines work for severe eye allergies in children
- What side effects these medicines might cause in children

### What needs to happen next?

More research is urgently needed. Scientists need to do proper studies to test these medicines in children and young people. These studies should find out:
- Which medicines work best
- How safe these medicines are
- What unwanted effects they might cause

Until these studies are done, doctors will not have clear guidance. They cannot be sure which medicine is the best choice for children with severe eye allergies.

### Why is this important?

Severe eye allergies can cause serious harm to children's eyesight. Doctors need good evidence to make the best treatment choices. Without proper research, it is hard to know which medicines help the most and which are safest for children."
10.1002-14651858.CD013299.pub2-pls.txt,"Pharmacies might be able to support people with their depression medicines
Background 
Some people with depression find it difficult to take their depression medicines (often called 'antidepressants') as prescribed by their doctor. This can mean that the medicines do not work properly and people might not get better or might even get worse. It could be that pharmacists and their teams can help people with their depression treatment in ways that their family doctor (general practitioner (GP)) cannot. Pharmacies are based within the community, easier to get to, and people may feel more comfortable telling a pharmacist about their mood. However, there are not many studies to tell us if this works. 
Study characteristics 
We searched medical databases for well‐designed studies that compared a group of adults with depression who received additional help with their depression medicines from their pharmacy with a group of adults with depression who received their treatment as usual. 
The evidence is current to 14 December 2018.
Key results and certainty of the evidence 
We found 12 studies with over 2000 adults taking part. They compared pharmacy‐based support with treatment as usual, for example, basic information about their medicines or signposting to other services only. We found that additional support given by the pharmacist was no better at reducing people's depression than their treatment as usual. The studies also showed that people may have liked both approaches the same, although we are uncertain about the results as the evidence was of low certainty. 
The studies did show that people who received support from their pharmacy were more likely to take their antidepressants as prescribed. We were not able to combine information from the included studies on other outcomes we were interested in (diagnosis of depression, frequency of healthcare appointments, quality of life, social functioning, or side effects). 
We found no difference in effectiveness when people with depression received additional support from a pharmacist compared with treatment as usual. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Can Pharmacists Help People Take Their Depression Medicines Better?

## Rationale

**What is depression and why is it a problem?**

Depression is a common health condition that affects how people feel and think. People with depression often need to take medicines called antidepressants to help them feel better.

**What is the problem this study looked at?**

Some people find it hard to take their depression medicines the way their doctor told them to. When people don't take their medicines correctly, the medicines may not work well. This means people might not get better or could even feel worse.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Researchers wanted to see if pharmacists could help. Pharmacies are easy to find in most communities. People can visit them without an appointment. Some people might feel more comfortable talking to a pharmacist about their feelings than talking to their family doctor.

**What did researchers think might happen?**

Researchers thought that getting extra help from pharmacists might help people take their medicines better. This could help people feel better from their depression.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked for well-done studies that were already finished. They searched medical databases to find these studies. They looked for studies that compared two groups of adults with depression.

**Who was in the study?**

The studies included over 2,000 adults who had depression. All of them were taking antidepressant medicines.

**What did the two groups do?**

One group got extra help from their pharmacist. The other group got their usual treatment. Usual treatment meant basic information about their medicines or being told about other services they could use.

**How long did the study last?**

The researchers looked at studies published up to December 2018. Different studies lasted different amounts of time.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found 12 studies to look at.

**Did pharmacy help reduce depression?**

The extra help from pharmacists did not make people's depression better than usual treatment. Both groups had similar results in how much their depression improved.

**Did people like the pharmacy help?**

People seemed to like both approaches about the same amount. However, researchers are not completely sure about this finding. The information was not strong enough to be certain.

**Did pharmacy help people take their medicines?**

Yes. People who got help from their pharmacist were more likely to take their antidepressant medicines the way their doctor told them to. This was better than the usual treatment group.

**What about other things?**

Researchers wanted to look at other important things. These included:
- How often people went to the doctor
- How good people felt about their life
- How well people got along with others
- Bad effects from the medicines

The studies did not have enough information to answer these questions.

**What do these results mean?**

Getting extra support from a pharmacist helps people take their depression medicines correctly. However, this extra help did not make people feel less depressed than usual treatment.

**How strong is this evidence?**

Some of the evidence was not very strong. This means we cannot be completely sure about all the findings. More research is needed to know for certain if pharmacy support helps people with depression.

**What should happen next?**

More studies are needed. Future studies should look at whether taking medicines correctly leads to feeling better over time. They should also look at other ways pharmacists might help people with depression."
10.1002-14651858.CD013304.pub2-pls.txt,"Do antipsychotic medicines reduce  agitated behaviour and psychotic symptoms in people with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia? 
 
Key messages 
It is uncertain whether older, first‐generation or ‘typical’ antipsychotic medicines such as haloperidol have an effect on agitated behaviour (for example, restlessness and aggression); the effect is moderate at best. Typical antipsychotic medicines may decrease delusions and hallucinations slightly in people with dementia.  
Newer, second‐generation ‘atypical’ antipsychotic medicines, such as risperidone, probably reduce agitated behaviour slightly. Atypical antipsychotic medicines probably have no effect on psychotic symptoms.  
Both first‐ and second‐generation antipsychotic medicines increase the risk of drowsiness and other unwanted events. When patients’ symptoms improve after antipsychotics have been prescribed, this is probably largely due to natural improvement in symptoms over time. 
What are antipsychotic medicines? 
Antipsychotics are medicines prescribed to treat psychotic symptoms and severely disturbed behaviour in some mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and severe depression. Psychotic symptoms are delusions (very strongly held beliefs in something which is not true) and hallucinations (sensing – usually seeing or hearing ‐ things which are not really there). 
Antipsychotic medicines are often divided into two groups:
1. first‐generation (older) or ‘typical’ antipsychotics, for example haloperidol;
2. second‐generation (newer) or ‘atypical’ antipsychotics, for example risperidone.
Both types can cause unwanted effects, such as drowsiness, movement disorders (for example, involuntary or uncontrollable movements, tremors, muscle contractions) and weight gain. 
Why do people with dementia need antipsychotics? 
People with dementia quite often experience hallucinations and delusions during their illness for some time. Particularly in the later stages of the illness, they may also show agitated behaviours such as restlessness, shouting out or aggression towards others. It is important to try to understand what is driving these behaviours and there are many ways to manage them which do not involve drugs. However, antipsychotic medicines have often been prescribed to people with dementia for these problems. In many countries, they are prescribed less often than in the past but are still used when the symptoms are severe. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know how well antipsychotic medicines reduce the severity of agitation and psychotic symptoms in people with the two commonest types of dementia, namely dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia. We also wanted to know how many people experienced unwanted effects. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that investigated antipsychotic medicines currently available in the USA or European Union by comparing them with placebo (a ’dummy’ pill), for treatment of persistent agitation or psychotic symptoms. People in the studies had to have Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia. They could be any age and reside in a care home, a hospital, or the community. Most of the people in the studies had to be experiencing agitation (including aggression) or psychotic symptoms, or both, at the start of the study. 
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found 24 studies with a total of 6090 people:
‐ six studies tested typical antipsychotics, mostly haloperidol; 
‐ 20 studies tested atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole; and  
‐ two studies tested both typical and atypical antipsychotics.
All the studies compared antipsychotics with placebo. The people were living in institutions, hospitals, the community, or a combination of these settings. 
Main results 
Typical antipsychotics (haloperidol, thiothixene) compared with placebo:
‐ may improve symptoms of psychosis slightly (2 studies, 240 people), but we are uncertain about their effect on agitation (4 studies, 361 people);  
‐ probably increase the risk of drowsiness (3 studies, 466 people), and movement disorders (3 studies, 467 people);  
‐ may slightly increase the risk of serious unwanted effects (1 study, 193 people) and of death (6 studies, 578 people).  
There was no evidence about the risk of non‐serious and serious unwanted effects combined.
Atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, quetiapine) compared with placebo: 
‐ probably slightly reduce agitation (7 studies, 1971 people) and may slightly reduce aggression (1 study, 301 people), but probably make no important difference to symptoms of psychosis (12 studies, 3364 people); 
‐ increase the risk of drowsiness (13 studies, 2878 people) and probably slightly increase movement disorders (15 studies, 4180 people); 
‐ probably slightly increase the risk of experiencing any non‐serious or serious unwanted effect combined, the risk of serious unwanted effects, and the risk of death (17 studies, 5032 people). 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Overall, our confidence in the evidence about typical antipsychotics is limited and our confidence in the evidence about atypical antipsychotics moderate. Typical antipsychotics have been investigated in just a few studies. In addition, the studies about typical and atypical antipsychotics did not always use the best methods to carry out their investigations, or did not report the results. Consequently, the effects on agitation or psychosis may have been overestimated, and the effects on adverse events underestimated.

","# Plain Language Summary: Do Antipsychotic Medicines Help People with Dementia Who Are Agitated or See and Hear Things That Are Not There?

## Rationale

**What is dementia and why does it matter?**

Dementia is a brain illness that gets worse over time. The two most common types are Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. People with dementia often lose their memory and have trouble thinking clearly.

**What problems do people with dementia face?**

Many people with dementia see or hear things that are not really there. These are called hallucinations. They may also believe things that are not true. These are called delusions. Some people with dementia become very restless, shout, or act aggressively toward others. This is called agitated behavior.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors sometimes give antipsychotic medicines to people with dementia who have these problems. Antipsychotics are drugs normally used to treat serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia. There are two types: older medicines (called typical antipsychotics, like haloperidol) and newer medicines (called atypical antipsychotics, like risperidone). Both types can cause unwanted side effects like drowsiness, shaking, and weight gain.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know if these medicines actually help reduce agitation and psychotic symptoms in people with dementia. They also wanted to know how often these medicines cause harmful side effects.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 24 different studies. These studies included 6,090 people total. All the people had either Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia. Most were experiencing agitation, aggression, or psychotic symptoms.

**What did the studies compare?**

Six studies tested older antipsychotic medicines. Twenty studies tested newer antipsychotic medicines. Two studies tested both types. All studies compared the medicines to a placebo. A placebo is a dummy pill with no active medicine in it.

**Who was in the studies?**

The people in the studies lived in different places. Some lived in nursing homes. Some lived in hospitals. Some lived at home in the community.

## Results

**What did researchers find about older antipsychotic medicines?**

The older medicines (like haloperidol) may slightly reduce hallucinations and delusions. However, researchers are not sure if they help with agitation. These medicines probably cause more drowsiness and movement problems like shaking or stiffness. They may slightly increase the risk of serious side effects and death.

**What did researchers find about newer antipsychotic medicines?**

The newer medicines (like risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole) probably reduce agitation slightly. They may also slightly reduce aggressive behavior. However, they probably do not help much with hallucinations and delusions. These medicines cause more drowsiness. They probably cause slightly more movement problems. They probably slightly increase the risk of any side effects, serious side effects, and death.

**What is the main conclusion?**

Both types of antipsychotic medicines have small benefits at best. They also cause harmful side effects. When symptoms improve after taking these medicines, it is probably because symptoms naturally get better over time, not because of the medicine.

**How confident are researchers in these findings?**

Researchers have limited confidence in the findings about older medicines. Only a few studies tested them. Researchers have moderate confidence in the findings about newer medicines. More studies tested these medicines. However, some studies did not use the best methods. Some studies did not report all their results. This means the benefits might be smaller than reported. The harmful effects might be worse than reported.

**What does this mean for patients?**

Antipsychotic medicines should be used carefully in people with dementia. The benefits are small. The risks of side effects are real. Doctors and families should try other ways to manage agitation and psychotic symptoms first. These medicines should only be used when symptoms are very severe.

**How current is this information?**

This review includes all studies published up to January 7, 2021."
10.1002-14651858.CD013305.pub2-pls.txt,"Behavioural activation therapy for depression in adults
Review question 
In this Cochrane review, we wanted to find out how well behavioural activation therapy works for depression in adults. 
Why this is important 
Depression is a common mental health problem that can cause a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest in people, activities, and things that were once enjoyable. A person with depression may feel tearful, irritable, or tired most of the time, and may have problems with sleep, concentration, and memory. These and other symptoms can make daily life more difficult than usual. 
Treatments for depression include medications (antidepressants) and psychological therapies (talking therapies). Behavioural activation is a type of psychological therapy that encourages a person to develop or get back into activities which are meaningful to them. The therapy involved scheduling activities and monitoring behaviours and looking at specific situations where changing these behaviours and activities may be helpful. A therapist may support people in person, over the phone, or online, usually over multiple sessions. 
It is important to know whether behavioural activation could be an effective and acceptable treatment to offer to people with depression. 
What we did 
In January 2020, we searched for studies of behavioural activation therapy for depression in adults (aged over 18 years). We looked for randomised controlled trials, in which treatments were given to study participants at random; these studies give the most reliable evidence. 
We included 53 studies involving 5495 participants. The studies compared behavioural activation with no treatment, standard or usual care, a dummy treatment (placebo), taking medications, being on a waiting list for treatment, or other psychotherapies (cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), third‐wave CBT, humanistic therapy, psychodynamic therapy, and integrative therapy). 
The studies were conducted in 14 countries; most were conducted in the USA (27 studies). Most studies lasted from four to 16 weeks. 
The outcomes we focussed on were how well the treatments worked and whether they were acceptable to participants. How well treatments worked (efficacy) was measured by the number of people who responded well to treatment or no longer met criteria for depression at the end of treatment. Acceptability was measured by counting how many people dropped out during the study. 
What did we find? 
Behavioural activation may treat depression better than receiving usual care. We were uncertain whether behavioural activation worked better than medication or being on a waiting list, and we found no evidence for this outcome comparing behavioural activation to no treatment or placebo treatment. 
We found no differences between behavioural activation and CBT in treating depression. Although we did not find enough evidence to compare behavioural activation reliably with other psychotherapies, it may work better than humanistic therapy, and we found no differences between behavioural activation and third‐wave CBT or psychodynamic therapy. No evidence was available comparing behavioural activation to integrative therapies. 
Behavioural activation is probably less acceptable to people than usual care. We found no differences in acceptability of behavioural activation compared with being on a waiting list, no treatment, taking antidepressants, or receiving a placebo treatment. We also found no differences in acceptability between behavioural activation and other psychotherapies studied (CBT, third‐wave CBT, humanistic therapy, integrative therapies). For behavioural activation compared with psychodynamic therapy, we found no evidence on treatment acceptability. 
Conclusions 
Behavioural activation may be an effective and acceptable treatment for depression in adults. Offering this therapy in practice would give people with depression greater treatment choice, and different formats and types of delivery could be explored to meet the demand for mental health support. Our confidence in these findings is limited due to concerns about the certainty of the evidence. 
Most findings were short‐term, meaning that we cannot be sure behavioural activation would be helpful to people with depression in the longer term. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Our certainty (confidence) in the evidence is mostly low to moderate. Some findings are based on only a few studies, with poorly reported results, in which the participants knew which treatment they received. Therefore, we are not sure how reliable the results are. Our conclusions may change if more studies are conducted. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Behavioral Activation Therapy for Depression in Adults

## Plain Title
Does Behavioral Activation Therapy Help Adults with Depression?

## Rationale

**What is depression?**
Depression is a common mental health problem. It makes people feel very sad for a long time. People with depression may lose interest in things they used to enjoy. They may feel tearful, cranky, or very tired most days. They may have trouble sleeping, focusing, or remembering things. These problems can make daily life much harder.

**What is behavioral activation therapy?**
Behavioral activation is a type of talk therapy. It helps people do activities that matter to them. A therapist helps people plan activities and watch their behaviors. They look at when changing these behaviors might help. A therapist can meet with people in person, by phone, or online. This usually happens over several sessions.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors treat depression with medicines or talk therapies. We needed to know if behavioral activation works well for depression. We also needed to know if people find this treatment acceptable. This information helps doctors offer good treatment choices to people with depression.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**
This was a review study. Researchers looked at many other studies done before. They searched for studies in January 2020. They found 53 studies with 5,495 people in total.

**Who was in these studies?**
All participants were adults over 18 years old. They all had depression.

**What did the studies compare?**
The studies compared behavioral activation to other treatments. These included:
- No treatment
- Standard care from a doctor
- Fake treatment (placebo)
- Depression medicines
- Waiting lists for treatment
- Other talk therapies

**Where were the studies done?**
Studies happened in 14 countries. Most studies (27 studies) were done in the USA.

**How long did the studies last?**
Most studies lasted 4 to 16 weeks.

**What did researchers measure?**
Researchers looked at two main things. First, they measured how well treatments worked. They counted how many people got better. They also counted how many people no longer had depression at the end. Second, they measured if treatments were acceptable. They counted how many people dropped out of the study.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

Behavioral activation may work better than standard care for treating depression. Researchers were not sure if it worked better than medicines or waiting lists. They found no proof comparing it to no treatment or fake treatment.

Behavioral activation worked about the same as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT is another common talk therapy. Behavioral activation may work better than humanistic therapy. It worked about the same as two other therapies called third-wave CBT and psychodynamic therapy.

**Was behavioral activation acceptable to people?**

People may find behavioral activation less acceptable than standard care. This means more people dropped out. For other comparisons, researchers found no differences. About the same number of people dropped out whether they got behavioral activation or other treatments. These other treatments included waiting lists, no treatment, medicines, fake treatment, and most other talk therapies.

**What do these results mean?**

Behavioral activation may be a good treatment choice for adults with depression. It gives people more options for treatment. Doctors could offer it in different ways to help more people get mental health support.

**Important limitations**

The researchers have some concerns about these findings. Some results came from only a few studies. Some studies were not well reported. In some studies, people knew which treatment they got. This could change the results. Most findings were short-term only. We do not know if behavioral activation helps people over a long time.

**Conclusions**

Behavioral activation may help treat depression in adults. It may be an acceptable treatment option. However, more research is needed. Better studies could make these findings more certain. Future studies should look at longer-term results."
10.1002-14651858.CD013307.pub3-pls.txt,"Non‐drug approaches for preventing delirium in adults receiving care in hospital outside of intensive care and high dependency units 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for non‐pharmacological (non‐medication‐based) approaches to prevent delirium in adults in hospital, not including those treated in intensive care units (ICU, specialised wards for the care of critically ill patients). 
Background 
Delirium is an important illness which is common among adults, especially older adults who are in hospital. It is sometimes referred to as an 'acute confusional state'. Typically, a person with delirium has sudden onset of confusion, which fluctuates, and often includes impaired concentration, memory and thinking skills; reduced awareness of surroundings; drowsiness or agitation and restlessness; and hallucinations, which are usually visual (seeing things which are not really there). It can be distressing for the individual with delirium and their family. It is also associated with increased risks of complications, such as dying in hospital, having a longer hospital stay, and requiring more care after discharge. Increasingly, there is evidence that delirium is associated with an increased risk of permanent worsening of memory and thinking skills, including development or worsening of dementia.  
Non‐pharmacological approaches are approaches which do not use medications, but which focus on other aspects of care. They are already recognised as important in reducing the risk of delirium, particularly multicomponent interventions which target several of the common risk factors for delirium. It is not known which components of these complex interventions are most important in preventing delirium and this was something we wanted to find out.  
Study characteristics 
We searched up to 16 September 2020 for reports of studies in which people in hospital were randomly allocated to a non‐pharmacological intervention intended to prevent delirium or to usual hospital care.  We found 22 studies with 5718 participants. Fourteen of the studies were of multicomponent approaches; two studies looked at different cut‐offs for giving a blood transfusion after an orthopaedic operation; the remaining six studies all considered different approaches. 
Key findings 
Multicomponent approaches probably reduce occurrence of delirium by 43% compared to usual hospital care. This means that two in five cases of delirium in adults in hospital wards (other than ICU) can be prevented by multicomponent, non‐pharmacological approaches. These interventions may also reduce the length of time people stay in hospital and, if delirium does occur, they may reduce the duration of the delirium episode by about a day. However, these approaches may have little or no effect on the risk of dying in hospital. The studies did not investigate the effect of multicomponent interventions on the development or worsening of dementia. There was little information about whether the interventions had any harmful effects.  
Using a new statistical technique, we found  that the following components within each intervention were most important for preventing delirium:  (a) trying to keep people well‐oriented to their surroundings and making their surroundings more familiar, (b) providing stimulation to memory and thinking skills, and (c) trying to improve sleep (through sleep hygiene measures). We could not be so certain about the effect of other components, largely because not enough evidence was available. More research is needed comparing the specific components included in multicomponent interventions to help determine the most effective and efficient ways to prevent delirium.  
The evidence for other, single‐component, non‐pharmacological interventions was very limited.  
Certainty of the evidence 
There were some limitations in the studies which may affect the results. In many included studies the people in the study and sometimes researchers were aware of who was and was not receiving the intervention.  
There was very little information about people living with dementia, who are at greater risk of experiencing delirium.  
External funding 
Funding to support researchers to undertake this review was received from the National Institute for Health Research (Incentive Award 130725) and Medical Research Scotland (Vacation Scholarship).  
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Ways to Prevent Sudden Confusion in Hospital Patients Without Using Medicines

## Rationale

### What is delirium?
Delirium is a sudden state of confusion that can happen to people in the hospital. It is also called an ""acute confusional state."" People with delirium may:
- Feel confused suddenly
- Have trouble thinking clearly
- Not know where they are
- Feel very sleepy or very restless
- See things that are not really there

The confusion comes and goes. It can be scary for patients and their families.

### Why is delirium a problem?
Delirium is common in hospitals, especially in older adults. It causes serious problems:
- Patients may die in the hospital
- Patients may stay in the hospital longer
- Patients may need more care after leaving the hospital
- Patients may develop memory problems that do not go away
- Patients may develop dementia or their dementia may get worse

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors know that some care methods can help prevent delirium without using medicines. These methods often include several different approaches used together. However, doctors do not know which parts of these approaches work best. This study looked at the research to find out which methods prevent delirium and which parts of these methods are most important.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was a review of other studies. Researchers looked for studies where:
- Adults were in the hospital (not in intensive care units)
- Some patients received special care to prevent delirium
- Other patients received usual hospital care
- Patients were randomly assigned to each group

Researchers searched for studies up to September 2020. They found 22 studies with 5,718 patients total.

### What types of approaches were studied?
- Fourteen studies tested approaches that used several methods together
- Two studies tested different rules for blood transfusions after bone surgery
- Six studies tested other single approaches

The studies included adults of different ages in hospitals. Most studies focused on older adults. The length of time patients were in the studies varied.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

**Approaches using several methods together:**
These approaches probably work well. They reduced delirium by about 43%. This means that 2 out of every 5 cases of delirium can be prevented using these methods.

These approaches may also help patients:
- Leave the hospital sooner
- Have shorter periods of confusion if delirium does happen (about one day shorter)

However, these approaches may not change the risk of dying in the hospital.

**Which parts of these approaches work best?**
Using a special method to analyze the data, researchers found three important parts:
1. Helping patients know where they are and making their surroundings feel familiar
2. Giving patients activities that use their memory and thinking skills
3. Helping patients sleep better through good sleep habits

Researchers could not be sure about other parts of the approaches. More research is needed.

**Other single approaches:**
There was not enough evidence to know if other single approaches work well.

### What are the limitations?
Some problems with the studies may affect the results:
- In many studies, patients and researchers knew who was getting the special care
- Very few studies included patients with dementia, even though these patients get delirium more often

### What does this mean?
Using several care methods together can prevent delirium in hospital patients. The most important parts seem to be helping patients stay oriented, keeping their minds active, and helping them sleep well. More research is needed to find the best ways to prevent delirium.

### Who paid for this review?
The National Institute for Health Research and Medical Research Scotland provided funding for this review."

Review questions 
What are the benefits and harms of the use of subcutaneous (under the skin) sensors for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) with or without an algorithm (a set of mathematical rules) to correct too high or too low ​​​​​ levels of blood glucose versus intermittent modalities to measure blood glucose with or without an algorithm to guide the correction of too high or too low blood glucose in preterm infants 1. at risk of too high or too low ​​​​​​ levels of blood glucose; 2. with proven too low ​​​​​​levels of blood glucose; and 3. with proven too high​​​​​​ levels of blood glucose? 
Background 
Newborns born too early ('preterm') are susceptible to levels of blood glucose that are too high or too low. Most preterm babies with these abnormal concentrations  have a full recovery, or only mild problems. For some preterm babies with extremely high or low (or more prolonged) blood glucose, this may lead to death or to problems later in life. 
The aim of this updated review was to assess whether the use of CGM could improve the long‐term development or reduce deaths in preterm newborns. CGM devices are inserted subcutaneously, and provide data on blood glucose in real time. The standard method of measuring blood glucose consists of measuring blood glucose concentrations intermittently by  withdrawing small amounts of blood, often by heel pricks.  
Study characteristicsWe collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer the review question, and found four studies enrolling 300 babies. These studies compared the use of CGM to intermittent measurements in infants at risk of too high or too low ​​​​​​ levels of blood glucose. 
Key results 
None of the four included studies reported on the long‐term neurodevelopmental outcome of preterm infants. The studies were too small to determine if CGM has an effect on survival. One study is ongoing. Although one study published in 2021 reported the incidence of serious intestinal injury (necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious inflammation of the intestines that can be life threatening) was lower in the CGM group, this finding is very uncertain because the results were very imprecise.  Further research is needed. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was very low due to the overall limited number of studies, with few babies enrolled. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We searched for studies that were available up to 1 April 2021.

## Plain Title
Can Special Sensors That Check Blood Sugar All the Time Help Babies Born Too Early?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Babies born too early (called preterm babies) often have problems with their blood sugar. Their blood sugar can get too high or too low. Most babies with this problem get better on their own or have only small problems later. But some babies with very high or very low blood sugar for a long time can die or have serious problems as they grow up.

**How do doctors check blood sugar now?**

Right now, doctors check blood sugar by taking small amounts of blood from the baby. They often prick the baby's heel to get the blood. They do this many times but not all the time.

**What is the new way being tested?**

There is a new device that can check blood sugar all the time. It is called a continuous glucose monitor, or CGM. A small sensor goes under the baby's skin. The sensor sends information about blood sugar to a screen. Doctors can see the blood sugar level at any moment.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if using CGM is better than heel pricks. They wanted to see if CGM could help more babies survive. They also wanted to know if CGM could help babies grow and develop better.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked for all studies that tested CGM in preterm babies. They found four studies. These studies included 300 babies total. The studies compared two groups of babies. One group had CGM sensors. The other group had the regular heel prick tests.

**Who was in the studies?**

All babies in the studies were born too early. These babies were at risk of having blood sugar that was too high or too low.

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies checked babies while they were in the hospital after birth. Different studies lasted different amounts of time.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers could not answer the main question. None of the four studies checked how babies grew and developed over time. The studies did not follow babies after they left the hospital.

The studies were too small to tell if CGM helps more babies survive. There were not enough babies in the studies to know for sure.

One study from 2021 looked at a serious gut problem. This problem is called necrotizing enterocolitis. It is a dangerous swelling of the intestines. This study found fewer babies with CGM had this problem. But the researchers are not sure about this finding. The results were not clear enough.

**What does this mean?**

We still do not know if CGM is better than heel pricks for preterm babies. We need more studies with more babies. We need studies that follow babies as they grow up.

One more study is still happening. It has not finished yet.

**Quality of the information**

The quality of the evidence was very low. This means we cannot trust the results very much. There were only four small studies. The studies did not have many babies. The studies did not measure the most important things, like how babies develop over time.

**How current is this information?**

Researchers looked for studies up to April 1, 2021.

**What happens next?**

More research is needed. Future studies should include more babies. They should follow babies for many years. This will help doctors know if CGM really helps preterm babies."
10.1002-14651858.CD013315-pls.txt,"Diverse strategies for preventing high altitude illness
Background 
The term high altitude illness (HAI) is used to describe a group of brain and lung conditions that can occur when people travel to altitudes above approximately 2500 metres (approximately 8200 feet). Individuals can respond to high altitudes in different ways and experience a variety of symptoms. These include HAI‐related headache, nausea, vomiting and tiredness, often called acute mountain sickness. Drowsiness, confusion or unconsciousness can occur when the brain is particularly affected (high altitude cerebral oedema or HACE), and cough or breathlessness when it is the lungs (high altitude pulmonary oedema or HAPE). A number of different strategies are used to prevent HAI. In this review we assessed the evidence from randomized controlled trials on whether various approaches could prevent the onset of high altitude illness, with a focus on non‐drug approaches, herbs and natural supplements. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to January 2019. We included 20 randomized controlled studies involving 1406 participants. The studies looked at diverse approaches to HAI prevention. These approaches included strategies to acclimatize to high altitudes by mimicking quick ascents by reducing levels of oxygen in the air that participants are breathing, and herbal products or vitamin supplements available without a prescription. 
The participants ranged in age between 17 and 65 years. Only one study included people at high risk of developing HAI as they had a history of HAI. Four trials provided the intervention between one to three days before making the ascent (20% of the studies), and eight between four to 30 days before departure for the ascent (40% of the studies). The participants in all these studies reached a final altitude of between 3500 and 5500 metres above sea level. Most of the studies did not provide clear information on how they were funded (55% of studies). Thirty additional studies were classified as either ongoing (14 studies), or awaiting classification (16 studies), and they will be considered in future versions of this suite of three reviews as appropriate. 
Key results 
The evidence for any benefit of the various strategies is inconclusive, and even contradictory among the included studies. 
In three studies comparing normal levels of oxygen with low oxygen levels as a way of acclimatization before leaving for high altitudes, we found no differences in the risk of developing acute mountain sickness (3 trials, 140 participants; low‐quality evidence). Adverse events were not reported, nor were high altitude cerebral oedema (HACE) or pulmonary oedema (HAPE). 
Ginkgo biloba was compared with taking an inactive placebo in seven studies (523 participants) looking at acute mountain sickness. There was no difference between ginkgo biloba and placebo in terms of the risk of developing HACE (3 studies, 371 participants), or in the risk of developing tingling or pricking, often described as 'pins and needles', as a side effect of treatment (2 studies, 352 participants). No HAPE events were reported (3 studies, 371 participants). 
Ginkgo biloba was compared with acetazolamide, which is a drug used to prevent acute mountain sickness, in four studies (397 participants). The findings differed between the studies, and no conclusions could be drawn. Acetazolamide increased the risk of developing pins and needles in two studies (354 participants). No HAPE or HACE events were reported. Overall, the limited information on the safety of the various interventions means that their safety remains unclear. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was low to very low. We could not obtain the full text reports of some of the studies we had identified, which limited the number of studies included in the review. Many of the studies had small numbers of participants; and for some outcomes few events occurred so that any findings were uncertain. Additional research is needed to clarify the effectiveness and safety of the various strategies to reduce HAI. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Ways to Prevent Sickness at High Altitudes

## Plain Title
Testing Different Ways to Prevent Sickness When Traveling to High Mountains

## Rationale

**What is high altitude illness?**

When people travel high up in the mountains (above 8,200 feet), their bodies may have trouble adjusting. This can cause a group of health problems called high altitude illness. The air has less oxygen at high places. This makes it hard for the body to work normally.

**What symptoms can occur?**

People can feel sick in different ways. Many people get headaches, feel sick to their stomach, throw up, and feel very tired. Doctors call this acute mountain sickness. Sometimes the brain swells up. This causes people to feel very sleepy, confused, or pass out. Sometimes the lungs fill with fluid. This makes people cough and have trouble breathing.

**Why was this study needed?**

Many people use different methods to prevent getting sick at high altitudes. Some people try breathing less oxygen before their trip. Others take herbs or vitamins. Doctors wanted to know if these methods really work. They looked at studies that tested these different approaches. This review helps people understand which methods might help keep them safe in the mountains.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 20 studies done by other scientists. These studies included 1,406 people total. The people in the studies were between 17 and 65 years old. Most people in the studies were healthy. Only one study included people who had gotten sick at high altitudes before.

**What did the studies test?**

The studies tested many different prevention methods. Some studies had people breathe air with less oxygen before their mountain trip. This was meant to help their bodies get ready. Other studies tested herbal products like ginkgo biloba. Some studies tested vitamin pills.

**When did people start the prevention methods?**

In some studies, people started 1 to 3 days before going up the mountain. In other studies, people started 4 to 30 days before their trip.

**How high did people climb?**

People in all the studies climbed to heights between 11,500 and 18,000 feet above sea level.

**How long did the studies last?**

The time people spent in each study varied. It depended on how long before the trip they started and how long they stayed at high altitude.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The results did not clearly show that these methods work. Different studies found different things. Sometimes the results disagreed with each other.

**Breathing low oxygen before the trip:**

Three studies tested this method with 140 people. They compared breathing normal air to breathing air with less oxygen. The studies found no difference in who got mountain sickness. The studies did not report if people had side effects. They also did not report brain or lung swelling.

**Ginkgo biloba herb:**

Seven studies with 523 people tested this herb. They compared it to fake pills with no medicine. The herb did not prevent mountain sickness better than the fake pills. Three studies with 371 people found no difference in brain swelling. Two studies with 352 people checked for tingling feelings (like pins and needles). There was no difference between groups. Three studies with 371 people reported no lung swelling in either group.

**Ginkgo biloba compared to acetazolamide medicine:**

Four studies with 397 people compared the herb to a medicine doctors often use. The studies found different results. Researchers could not make clear conclusions. The medicine caused more tingling feelings in two studies with 354 people. No one got brain or lung swelling in these studies.

**What about safety?**

The studies did not give enough information about side effects. Researchers cannot say if these methods are safe or not.

**What do these results mean?**

The evidence is not strong enough to recommend these methods. More research is needed. The studies had problems. Some studies were very small. Some things happened so rarely that results were unclear. Better studies are needed to know if these methods work and are safe.

**Conclusion:**

Right now, doctors cannot say these methods prevent high altitude sickness. People planning mountain trips should talk to their doctors about proven ways to stay safe."
10.1002-14651858.CD013316.pub2-pls.txt,"Which method of determining MGMT promoter methylation best predicts survival in people with glioblastoma treated with temozolomide? 
What was the aim of this review? 
Glioblastoma is a very aggressive type of brain cancer. People with glioblastoma are usually treated with surgical removal of the tumour followed by radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or both. The standard chemotherapy is a medicine called temozolomide. Some glioblastoma tumours have a particular modification in their DNA (which contains the genetic code of organisms), and knowing whether a person has this modification is useful to predict how long the person may live after their diagnosis with cancer and how they may respond to temozolomide. The modification is known as 'methylation of the MGMT promoter region' and it can also affect MGMT protein expression (the way MGMT is made and modified). There are many ways to work out whether a tumour has this modification. In this review, we attempted to work out which method is best. 
What we found 
We identified 32 studies comparing different ways to measure whether the MGMT promoter region is methylated. The main three methods were called 'methylation‐specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR),' 'pyrosequencing' (both of which look directly at the MGMT promoter region) and 'immunohistochemistry' (which looks at MGMT protein expression). We found that methylation‐specific PCR and pyrosequencing are better at predicting overall survival than immunohistochemistry. Methylation‐specific PCR and pyrosequencing can be carried out by targeting different parts of the tumour DNA. Pyrosequencing can be performed using different cut‐off thresholds to determine whether a tumour is methylated or unmethylated. We did not identify very clear signals in terms of the best parts of the DNA to target or which are the best cut‐off thresholds. 
How reliable are results of the studies in this review? 
We rated our confidence in the evidence as 'moderate' for our conclusions about methylation‐specific PCR, but as 'low' for pyrosequencing. Although there were many studies, they all looked at different variants of the methods, so it is difficult to work out exactly which variant is best. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Our review indicates both methylation‐specific PCR and pyrosequencing provide better predictions of survival than immunohistochemistry. There is some evidence that pyrosequencing may be better than methylation‐specific PCR at predicting overall survival, depending on the DNA targets and cut‐off thresholds used. We documented the most frequent DNA targets used in methylation‐specific PCR and pyrosequencing. We described cut‐off thresholds used in pyrosequencing, although it is unclear which of these is best.

Finding the Best Test to Predict How Long People with Brain Cancer Live When Treated with Chemotherapy

## Rationale

**What is glioblastoma?**
Glioblastoma is a very serious type of brain cancer. It grows fast and is hard to treat. People with this cancer face a difficult journey.

**How is glioblastoma treated?**
Doctors usually remove the tumor with surgery first. After surgery, patients get radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or both. The most common chemotherapy drug is called temozolomide.

**Why did researchers do this study?**
Some brain tumors have a special change in their DNA. DNA is like an instruction book inside our cells. This change is called ""MGMT promoter methylation."" It is a big word that means a small part of the DNA is modified.

This change is important. It helps doctors predict two things. First, how long a person might live after diagnosis. Second, how well the chemotherapy drug temozolomide might work.

**What was the problem?**
Doctors have many different tests to find this DNA change. But no one knew which test works best. This study tried to answer that question. Finding the best test would help doctors make better treatment choices for their patients.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**
This was a review study. Researchers looked at 32 other studies that had already been done. They compared different testing methods to see which one worked best.

**What tests did they compare?**
The researchers looked at three main types of tests:

1. Methylation-specific PCR: This test looks directly at the DNA change.
2. Pyrosequencing: This test also looks directly at the DNA change but in a different way.
3. Immunohistochemistry: This test looks at a protein called MGMT instead of the DNA itself.

**Who were the patients in these studies?**
The studies included people diagnosed with glioblastoma. These patients were being treated with temozolomide chemotherapy.

**What did researchers measure?**
They wanted to know which test best predicted how long patients would live. This is called overall survival.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The researchers found important differences between the tests.

Two tests worked better than the third. Methylation-specific PCR and pyrosequencing both predicted survival better than immunohistochemistry. This means these two tests give doctors more useful information.

The test called immunohistochemistry did not work as well. It looks at protein instead of DNA. This may be why it was less accurate.

**What about comparing the two best tests?**

Both methylation-specific PCR and pyrosequencing look at DNA directly. Some evidence suggests pyrosequencing might work slightly better than methylation-specific PCR. But this depends on exactly how the test is done.

**Why was this finding not completely clear?**

Each test can be done in different ways. For pyrosequencing, doctors must choose a cut-off number. This number helps decide if the tumor has the DNA change or not. Different studies used different cut-off numbers.

Both tests can also look at different parts of the DNA. The researchers found which DNA parts were used most often. But they could not say for certain which parts work best.

**How confident are we in these results?**

The researchers felt moderately confident about methylation-specific PCR results. They felt less confident about pyrosequencing results. This is because studies used many different versions of these tests. More research using the same methods would help.

**What does this mean for patients?**

This study helps doctors choose better tests. Better tests mean better predictions about how patients will respond to treatment. This information helps doctors and patients make informed choices about care.

The study shows that testing DNA directly works better than testing protein. Doctors should use methylation-specific PCR or pyrosequencing instead of immunohistochemistry."
10.1002-14651858.CD013319.pub2-pls.txt,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus surgical aortic valve replacement in people with severe aortic stenosis and low surgical risk 
Review question 
Does transcatheter approach, compared to open‐heart surgery, for aortic valve replacement improve outcomes in people with severe aortic stenosis and low surgical risk? 
Background 
Aortic stenosis (AS) is the narrowing of the exit of the left ventricle of the heart (where the aorta begins). It typically gets worse over time. Its severity can be divided into mild, moderate, severe, and very severe; and it is distinguishable by ultrasound scan of the heart and other clinical features. Once it has become severe, treatment primarily involves surgery to replace the valve. An alternative approach is to use transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). This approach improves outcomes in individuals who are inoperable or at a high to intermediate risk for surgery. However, it remains unclear if TAVI is beneficial to those who have severe AS and are at a low surgical risk. 
Search Date 
The evidence is current to April 2019. We searched the literature and found a total of 3092 citations that were potentially relevant. After reviewing each of these, we found 13 published articles describing four clinical trials that could help us answer our question. 
Study characteristics 
The four clinical trials included 2818 participants who were randomly allocated to undergo either TAVI or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). The trials were multicentre and took place in Australia, Canada, France, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the USA, Denmark, and Sweden. 
Key Results 
Moderate‐certainty evidence from clinical trials shows that, in the short term (i.e. during hospitalisation and up to 30 days of follow‐up), there is probably little or no difference between TAVI compared with SAVR in risk of death due to any cause, stroke (insult to the brain), myocardial infarction (injury or death of heart muscle), or death due to cardiac causes (e.g. myocardial infarction or failure of the heart muscle pump). Low‐certainty evidence shows that TAVI may reduce the risk of rehospitalisation compared with SAVR. We are uncertain whether TAVI, compared with SAVR, affects the length of hospital stay, although it appears to be associated with shorter duration of hospitalisation. High‐certainty evidence shows that fewer people had atrial fibrillation (a type of irregular heart rhythm), acute kidney injury (insult to the kidney), and bleeding when they underwent TAVI, compared with SAVR. However, moderate‐certainty evidence shows that TAVI probably increases the risk of permanent pacemaker implantation (a device that is placed to artificially set the heart rhythm), compared with SAVR. 
Quality of the evidence 
We consider the overall quality of evidence to be moderate for most relevant outcomes (death, stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiac death, and risk of permanent pacemaker implantation), with the exception of rehospitalisation (low‐quality evidence) and length of hospital stay (very low quality evidence). The evidence for atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, and bleeding was of high quality.

## Plain Title
Comparing Two Ways to Replace Heart Valves in People with Severe Aortic Stenosis Who Are Healthy Enough for Surgery

## Rationale

### What is aortic stenosis?
Aortic stenosis is a heart problem. The aortic valve becomes too narrow. This valve controls blood flow out of the heart. When the valve is narrow, the heart must work harder to pump blood.

### What happens with this condition?
The narrowing gets worse over time. Doctors measure how bad it is. They use terms like mild, moderate, or severe. They check the valve using a special scan called an ultrasound.

### Why does this matter to patients?
Severe aortic stenosis makes people very sick. The heart cannot pump blood well. People feel tired and short of breath. Without treatment, this condition can be deadly.

### What treatments exist?
For many years, doctors used open-heart surgery. They cut open the chest. Then they replace the bad valve with a new one. This is called SAVR.

A newer way exists called TAVI. Doctors thread a new valve through blood vessels. They do not need to open the chest. This method works well for very sick patients. These patients cannot have regular surgery.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors wanted to know something important. Does TAVI work for healthier patients too? These patients can safely have regular surgery. No one knew which method was better for them.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked at four different studies. These studies compared TAVI with SAVR. The studies took place in many countries. These included the United States, Canada, France, Japan, and others.

### Who was in the studies?
The studies included 2,818 people total. All had severe aortic stenosis. All were healthy enough for regular surgery. This means they had low surgical risk.

Researchers divided people into two groups randomly. One group got TAVI. The other group got SAVR. Neither patients nor doctors chose which treatment.

### How long did the studies last?
Researchers watched patients during their hospital stay. They also checked on patients for 30 days after treatment.

## Results

### What did researchers find about death and major problems?
The two treatments worked about the same. Similar numbers of people died from either treatment. Similar numbers had strokes. A stroke happens when blood cannot reach the brain. Similar numbers had heart attacks. Similar numbers died from heart problems.

### What about going back to the hospital?
People who had TAVI may have gone back to the hospital less often. But researchers are not completely sure about this finding.

### How long did people stay in the hospital?
People who had TAVI might have left the hospital sooner. But researchers are very uncertain about this result.

### What problems happened less with TAVI?
Three problems happened less often with TAVI:
- Fewer people had atrial fibrillation. This is when the heart beats in an odd way.
- Fewer people had kidney injury.
- Fewer people had serious bleeding.

### What problems happened more with TAVI?
More people needed a pacemaker after TAVI. A pacemaker is a small device. Doctors put it in the chest. It helps the heart beat at the right speed.

### How strong is this evidence?
Most findings are trustworthy. Researchers feel confident about most results. They are less sure about hospital readmission. They are very unsure about hospital stay length.

### What does this mean?
For healthy patients with severe aortic stenosis, both treatments work well. TAVI causes fewer problems like bleeding and kidney injury. But TAVI causes more need for pacemakers. Patients and doctors can choose either treatment. They should talk about which is best for each person."
10.1002-14651858.CD013320.pub2-pls.txt,"Low levels of sugar to prevent cardiovascular disease
Background 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a group of disorders affecting the heart and blood vessels and the number one cause of death worldwide. It is important to detect modifiable risk factors and find strategies to prevent CVD. There are several established modifiable risk factors for developing CVD, one of them being eating an unhealthy diet rich in sugar. Sugar can be divided in two categories; sugars naturally occurring in food and sugars that are added to food. A high level of added sugar intake is suggested to cause weight gain and affect blood lipids, increasing the risk of CVD. This review assessed different levels of added sugars in the diet and the effect on cardiovascular events (e.g. heart attack or stroke), death, and CVD risk factors in healthy adults. 
Study characteristics 
Databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical trials in which participants are randomly assigned to either an experimental or a control treatment) were searched. The trials that were included compared different levels of added sugar intake and its effect on risk factors for CVD in healthy adults. People with previous CVD or diabetes were not included in the review. 
Key results 
Twenty‐one trials were found with 1110 participants. None of the trials looked at cardiovascular events or death. The trials reported on blood pressure, blood lipid levels and blood sugar levels. The review found that low levels of added sugar intake led to a small reduction in blood pressure and blood lipid levels, but no effect was seen on blood sugar. The evidence is current to July 2021. 
Quality of the evidence 
The studies included in the review provide low‐quality evidence that low levels of added sugar in the diet indirectly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. More long‐term studies of high quality assessing effects of different levels of sugar on CVD risk factors, cardiovascular events and death are needed.

## Plain Title
Can Eating Less Added Sugar Help Protect Your Heart?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Heart disease is a group of problems that affect the heart and blood vessels. It is the top cause of death around the world. Heart disease can lead to heart attacks and strokes.

**Why does this matter?**

Doctors want to find ways to stop heart disease before it starts. What we eat plays a big role in heart health. Foods with a lot of added sugar may harm our hearts.

**What is added sugar?**

There are two types of sugar in food. Some sugar is found naturally in foods like fruit and milk. Other sugar is added when food is made or cooked. This is called added sugar. You find it in candy, soda, cookies, and many other foods.

**Why study added sugar?**

Eating too much added sugar may cause weight gain. It may also change the fats in your blood in bad ways. Both of these things can raise your risk of heart disease.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know if eating less added sugar could help protect the heart. They looked at whether low sugar diets could prevent heart attacks and strokes. They also looked at whether these diets could improve things that affect heart health.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not one single study. Instead, researchers looked at many studies done by other scientists. They searched for a special type of study called a randomized controlled trial. In these studies, people are put into groups by chance. One group eats less added sugar. Another group eats more added sugar. Then scientists compare what happens to each group.

**Who was in these studies?**

The researchers found 21 studies. These studies included 1,110 people total. All the people in the studies were healthy adults. People who already had heart disease were not included. People who had diabetes were not included either.

**What did the studies compare?**

The studies compared different amounts of added sugar in the diet. Some people ate less added sugar. Other people ate more added sugar. Then researchers measured things that affect heart health.

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies lasted different amounts of time. The review does not give exact details about how long people stayed in each study.

## Results

**What did the researchers measure?**

None of the studies looked at actual heart attacks or strokes. None looked at death rates. Instead, the studies measured things that can lead to heart disease. These included blood pressure, blood fats, and blood sugar levels.

**What did the studies find?**

People who ate less added sugar had small improvements in some areas:
- Their blood pressure went down a little bit
- The fat levels in their blood improved a little bit
- Their blood sugar levels did not change

**What does this mean?**

Lower blood pressure and better blood fat levels can help protect against heart disease. So eating less added sugar might help reduce the risk of heart problems over time.

**How strong is this evidence?**

The quality of the evidence was low. This means we cannot be completely sure about the results. The studies were not long enough. They did not look at actual heart attacks or deaths. More research is needed.

**What do researchers conclude?**

Eating less added sugar may help protect your heart in small ways. It may lower blood pressure and improve blood fats. But we need better studies that last longer. Future studies should look at whether less sugar actually prevents heart attacks, strokes, and deaths.

**When was this information gathered?**

The researchers looked at all studies published up to July 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013330.pub2-pls.txt,"Non‐pharmacological interventions for preventing clotting of extracorporeal circuits during continuous kidney replacement therapy 
What is the issue? 
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major problem in people with severe illness. In cases of severe AKI, kidney replacement therapy/dialysis (KRT) using circuits is necessary. Continuous kidney replacement therapy is performed continuously over 24 hours. Clotting of the CKRT circuit can interfere with this treatment. To prevent this, a variety of non‐pharmacological (not using medication) interventions have been studied. We aimed to summarise current evidence regarding the efficacy of non‐pharmacological interventions for preventing clotting of extracorporeal circuits during CKRT. 
What did we do? 
We searched for available evidence from the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 25 January 2021. Our review summarised the results of 20 randomised studies involving a total of 1143 people. 
What did we find? 
We found that the quality of the 20 included studies was low, and the number randomised was small. The majority of the included studies did not report death as an outcome. We found that continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF), as compared with continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH), may prolong circuit lifespan. In addition, pre‐dilution haemofiltration, as compared with post‐dilution haemofiltration, a longer catheter placing the tip at the right atrium, as compared with a shorter catheter placing the tip in the superior vena cava, and surface‐modified double lumen catheter, as compared with standard double lumen catheter, may extend the circuit lifespan. However, higher blood flow compared to standard blood flow rate might not affect circuit lifespan. Overall, the data was limited and of very low certainty. 
Conclusions 
We found that the effects of non‐pharmacological interventions in people with AKI receiving CKRT remain unclear. There is a need for studies assessing CKRT circuit lifespan as well as other clinically important outcomes. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Ways to Prevent Blood Clotting in Kidney Dialysis Machines Without Using Drugs

## What Was This Study About?

When people become very sick, their kidneys can suddenly stop working well. This problem is called acute kidney injury, or AKI. People with severe AKI need a special treatment called dialysis. This treatment uses a machine to clean the blood when the kidneys cannot do this job.

One type of dialysis runs all day and night without stopping. It is called continuous kidney replacement therapy, or CKRT. During this treatment, blood flows through tubes and filters outside the body. Sometimes the blood clots, or forms lumps, in these tubes. When this happens, the treatment must stop. Doctors have tried different ways to prevent clotting without using drugs.

The researchers wanted to find out which methods work best. They looked at studies that tested different ways to keep the blood flowing smoothly through the dialysis machine.

## How Was This Study Designed?

The researchers searched for all studies done on this topic up to January 2021. They found 20 studies that tested different methods. These studies included 1,143 people total.

The studies looked at people who were very sick and needed continuous dialysis. The researchers compared different ways of running the dialysis machines. They wanted to see which methods kept the tubes working longer before they got clogged.

## What Were the Main Results?

The researchers found several things that might help:

**Different types of dialysis:** One method called CVVHDF may keep the tubes working longer than another method called CVVH. Both clean the blood, but they work in slightly different ways.

**Where fluid is added:** Adding fluid before the filter may work better than adding it after the filter. This helps thin the blood before it goes through the machine.

**Tube placement:** Using a longer tube that reaches deeper into the heart may work better than a shorter tube. The longer tube goes to a part of the heart called the right atrium. The shorter tube only reaches a large vein near the heart.

**Special tube coating:** Tubes with a special coating on the inside may work better than regular tubes. The coating helps prevent clots from forming.

**Blood flow speed:** Making blood flow faster through the machine did not seem to help prevent clotting.

## What Does This Mean?

The researchers found that the studies had problems. Many studies were small and not well done. Most studies did not report if people lived or died. The information was not clear enough to know for sure which methods work best.

More research is needed. Future studies should be larger and better designed. They should measure how long the tubes work. They should also measure other important things, like whether people get better or have side effects.

Right now, doctors cannot be certain which methods work best to prevent clotting in dialysis machines. The evidence is too weak to make strong recommendations. Better studies will help doctors choose the best ways to care for very sick people who need continuous dialysis.

What was the aim of this review?To examine the effects of tea tree oil, an essential oil derived from an Australian tree, which can be applied in many different forms (eyelid wipes, eyelid shampoo, oil massages, etc.) on Demodex blepharitis. Demodex blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelid caused by Demodex mites (frequently referred to as eyelash mites). 
Key messagesWe are uncertain if tea tree oil is better compared to other treatments. Other factors such as dosage, ocular hygiene, and patient compliance likely affect treatment outcomes; however, more and better‐designed studies are needed to confirm these findings. 
What did we study in this review?Blepharitis causes symptoms such as eye itching, burning, dryness, irritation, watering, or blurry vision, which lead people to seek medical attention. This study aimed to understand the ability of tea tree oil to improve symptoms or to treat Demodex blepharitis (or both) in comparison to no treatment or other forms of treatment containing no tea tree oil. 
What were the main results of this review?This review included six studies with 562 participants (1124 eyes). They were men and women between the ages of 39 and 55 years. The included studies were conducted in the US, Korea, China, Australia, Ireland, and Turkey. Trial designs greatly varied, which limited analyses and the confidence in the results. Most studies included in this report had a high degree of bias. It is uncertain if tea tree oil (concentration ranging from 5% to 50%) is helpful for reducing the number of Demodex mites in people with Demodex blepharitis in short‐term cases. While not fully addressed in the reviewed literature, people should be educated on how to properly apply tea tree oil products because patient compliance and method of application likely affects efficacy. None of the studies in this review reported any side effects directly related to the treatment; however, one study did report irritation around the eyes on using tea tree oil, which was resolved on re‐educating the person on the application technique.

","# Plain Language Summary: Tea Tree Oil for Eyelid Inflammation Caused by Tiny Mites

## Plain Title
Does Tea Tree Oil Help Treat Eyelid Inflammation Caused by Eyelash Mites?

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**
Some people get inflammation of their eyelids. This is called blepharitis. Tiny bugs called Demodex mites can cause this problem. These mites are also called eyelash mites. They live on the eyelashes.

**What problems does it cause?**
When people have this condition, their eyes may itch or burn. Their eyes may feel dry or irritated. Their eyes may water. Their vision may become blurry. These problems bother people enough that they go to the doctor for help.

**Why was this study needed?**
Tea tree oil comes from a tree in Australia. People can use it in different ways. They can use wipes for their eyelids. They can use special eyelid shampoo. They can use oil massages. Doctors wanted to know if tea tree oil works to treat eyelid inflammation caused by these mites.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Researchers wanted to see if tea tree oil helps reduce symptoms. They wanted to know if it treats the mite problem. They compared tea tree oil to no treatment. They also compared it to other treatments that do not have tea tree oil.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was a review of other studies. Researchers looked at six different studies. These studies included 562 people total. The studies looked at 1124 eyes.

**Who was in the studies?**
The people in the studies were men and women. They were between 39 and 55 years old. All of them had eyelid inflammation caused by Demodex mites.

**Where were the studies done?**
The studies took place in different countries. These included the US, Korea, China, Australia, Ireland, and Turkey.

**When was this review done?**
Researchers looked for studies published before June 18, 2019.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**
The researchers are not sure if tea tree oil works better than other treatments. The studies used different amounts of tea tree oil. The amounts ranged from 5 out of 100 parts to 50 out of 100 parts. The results were unclear about whether tea tree oil reduces the number of mites in the short term.

**What problems did the studies have?**
The studies were very different from each other. This made it hard to compare them. Most studies had problems with how they were done. This means we cannot fully trust the results. More studies are needed. These new studies need to be better designed.

**What else might matter?**
Other things probably affect how well the treatment works. How much tea tree oil people use matters. Keeping the eyes clean matters. Whether people use the product correctly matters. People need to learn the right way to apply tea tree oil products.

**Were there any side effects?**
None of the studies reported bad side effects from the treatment. One study did report eye irritation. This happened when people used tea tree oil. The problem went away after doctors taught people the correct way to apply it.

**What do the results mean?**
We cannot say for sure if tea tree oil helps treat eyelid inflammation from mites. The studies did not give clear answers. Patient education is important. People need to know how to use the products correctly. This likely affects whether the treatment works.

**What is needed next?**
More research is needed. Future studies should be designed better. They should use similar methods. This will help doctors know if tea tree oil really works for this condition."
10.1002-14651858.CD013336-abstract.txt,"Extended versus standard lymph node dissection in patients with bladder cancer undergoing total bladder removal 
Review question 
When removing the whole bladder for bladder cancer, how does removing the lymph nodes from a large area (extended lymph node dissection) compare to only from a smaller area (standard lymph node dissection)? 
Background 
People with advanced cancer of the bladder that has spread into the deep muscle layers (but not outside the bladder) often have an operation to remove the whole bladder. As part of this operation, surgeons remove lymph nodes in that part of the body, which is an important part of the immune system. Traditionally, only the lymph nodes close to the bladder and its major blood vessels were removed. This is called a standard lymph node dissection which removes lymph nodes as high up as to where the main blood vessels for the pelvis and the leg split up. Some people think that also removing lymph nodes further away from the bladder is better in getting rid of cancer. This is called an extended lymph node dissection. It removes lymph nodes as high up as the blood vessels that supply the lower part of the intestines. We don't know whether this indeed helps people live longer and not die from bladder cancer and how the unwanted effects compare. 
Study characteristics 
We included only studies in which chance determined whether people got a standard or extended lymph node dissection that was reported in literature up to April 29, 2019. 
Key results 
We found only one such study that answered our review question. This study was done at 16 large hospitals in Germany and included 401 men and women with bladder cancer. 
We found that having an extended node dissection may make people less likely to die for any reason or to die from bladder cancer over time, although our confidence in this result is limited. 
We are uncertain whether an extended node dissection causes more serious unwanted effects than a standard lymph node dissection. 
We are also uncertain whether an extended node dissection makes cancer less likely to come back over time and causes a similar risk of not‐so‐serious unwanted effects compared to a standard lymph node dissection. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of evidence for these findings was low or very low, meaning that the true outcomes may be very different from what this review found.

## Plain Title
Removing More Lymph Nodes During Bladder Cancer Surgery: Does It Help Patients Live Longer?

## Rationale

**What is bladder cancer and why is it a problem?**

Some people get cancer in their bladder. The bladder is the organ that holds urine. When cancer grows deep into the bladder wall, doctors often need to remove the whole bladder. This is a major surgery.

**What are lymph nodes?**

Lymph nodes are small bean-shaped parts of the body. They help fight disease. Cancer can spread to lymph nodes near the bladder.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

During bladder removal surgery, doctors also take out lymph nodes. This helps remove cancer that may have spread. Doctors can remove lymph nodes from a small area (standard removal). Or they can remove lymph nodes from a larger area (extended removal). Extended removal takes out lymph nodes farther from the bladder.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know: Does removing more lymph nodes help patients live longer? They also wanted to know if removing more lymph nodes causes more problems or side effects.

Some doctors think removing more lymph nodes gets rid of more cancer. But no one knew for sure if this was true. This study tried to find the answer.

## Trial Design

**How was this study set up?**

This study was done at 16 large hospitals in Germany. The study included 401 people with bladder cancer. Both men and women were in the study.

**How did the study work?**

Chance decided which surgery each person got. This is like flipping a coin. Some people got standard lymph node removal. Other people got extended lymph node removal. Using chance makes the study fair and trustworthy.

**What kind of patients were in the study?**

All patients had bladder cancer that grew deep into the bladder muscle. The cancer had not spread outside the bladder. All patients needed their whole bladder removed.

**How long did the study last?**

The study followed patients over time after surgery. This let researchers see how long patients lived. They also watched for cancer coming back.

## Results

**What did researchers find about living longer?**

People who had extended lymph node removal may be less likely to die. They may also be less likely to die from bladder cancer specifically. But researchers are not very confident in this finding. More studies are needed to be sure.

**What about side effects?**

Researchers are not sure if extended removal causes more serious side effects. They are also not sure about less serious side effects. The study did not give clear answers about this.

**What about cancer coming back?**

Researchers are not sure if extended removal stops cancer from coming back. The study did not give a clear answer.

**How strong is this evidence?**

The evidence from this study is weak. Only one study answered this question. The real results might be very different from what this study found.

**What does this mean for patients?**

Extended lymph node removal might help patients live longer. But we cannot be certain yet. Doctors and patients should talk about the risks and benefits. More research is needed to know for sure.

**Why is this study important?**

This study is one of the first to compare these two surgeries fairly. It helps doctors and patients make better choices. But more studies are needed before we know the best way to do this surgery.

10.1002-14651858.CD013339.pub2-pls.txt,"Step‐by‐step (algorithm‐based) pain management for people with dementia living in nursing homes 
What is the aim of this review? 
We were interested in how nurses can best manage pain in people with dementia living in nursing homes. Pain management involves measuring pain and providing pain treatment if necessary. We aimed to find out whether step‐by‐step guidance (an algorithm) for nurses on how to manage pain can reduce pain or behaviours that may indicate someone is in distress (such as hitting, shouting or wandering). 
What was studied in the review? 
People with dementia in nursing homes often experience pain. However, they cannot always tell their caregivers if they are in pain, so it can be difficult to recognise, and we know that nursing home residents with dementia receive less pain medication than those without dementia. Untreated pain can have a negative impact on well‐being and health, and can also be one reason for challenging behaviour, such as aggression. The use of detailed step‐by‐step guidance for nursing staff, in this review called an algorithm, is designed to improve pain management. Algorithms start with a structured pain assessment and then set out different treatment steps, which can be non‐medication or medication treatments for reducing pain. If pain is detected, the treatment described in the first step is applied. If this treatment does not reduce pain, the treatment from the next step is applied, and so on. 
Studies included in the review 
In June 2021 we searched for trials that investigated pain management based on the use of an algorithm. We found three studies including 808 participants. Two of these studies compared algorithm‐based pain management with education for the nursing staff on pain and dementia, and one study compared algorithm‐based pain management with usual care. 
The level of pain and the severity of the participants' dementia differed in the three studies. One study included all the residents in the nursing homes, most of whom had no pain, or almost no pain, at the start of the study (fewer than half of the included people experienced pain), and two studies included only people with mild to moderate pain. In one study the participants' dementia was of mild or moderate severity and in two studies the participants had severe dementia. 
In two studies, those people with dementia who were able to do so reported on their own pain and the nursing staff also judged whether the participants showed signs of pain. In the third study, pain was rated by members of the research team, but not by the participants themselves. The nurses and the researchers used observations of things like facial expressions, gestures and breathing to judge whether someone was in pain. 
What are the key findings? 
When we looked at the study in which people started out on average with no pain, or almost no pain, we could not be certain whether algorithm‐based pain management had an effect on the intensity of pain they experienced during the study. This was true whether the study participants reported on their own pain or whether nurses judged pain intensity. We also could not tell from this study whether algorithm‐based pain management reduced challenging behaviour. 
For people who started out with mild to moderate pain, we found that, compared to education for nursing staff, algorithm‐based pain management may have little or no effect on pain intensity reported by the people themselves (based on the results from one study). When the pain was rated by somebody else (a 'proxy', who was a nurse or research assistant), we found that algorithm‐based pain management may be better than usual care, although it may not be more effective than pain education. However, it is difficult to be sure about the accuracy of pain ratings made by other people. 
Our confidence in the results was limited because of the small number of included studies, the variation in the intensity of pain and in the severity of the participants' dementia at the start of the trials, and the quality of the studies. 
No study looked for harmful effects, and no study described that any harmful effects occurred. 
What is the conclusion? 
We found no good evidence that introducing an algorithm to guide pain management for people with dementia in nursing homes is any better than education for nursing staff for reducing pain or challenging behaviours, but it may be better than usual care at reducing pain (rated by observers). The amount of evidence was small, and we could not be certain of the results. More research in this area would be valuable. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Managing Pain in People with Dementia Living in Nursing Homes

## Plain Title
Can step-by-step guides help nurses manage pain better for people with dementia in nursing homes?

## Rationale

**What is the problem?**

People with dementia often live in nursing homes. Many of them feel pain. But they cannot always tell nurses when they hurt. This makes it hard for nurses to know when someone needs help.

**Why does this matter?**

When pain is not treated, it can make people feel worse. It can harm their health. Pain can also make people act out. They might hit, shout, or wander around. We know that people with dementia get less pain medicine than people without dementia. This is not fair or safe.

**What might help?**

Nurses could use a step-by-step guide to manage pain. This guide is called an algorithm. It tells nurses what to do first, second, and third. The guide starts by checking for pain. Then it lists treatments to try. These can be medicine or other ways to reduce pain. If the first treatment does not work, nurses try the next step. They keep going until the pain gets better.

**Why study this?**

We wanted to know if these step-by-step guides work. Do they reduce pain? Do they help with problem behaviors? We looked for studies that tested this idea.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this?**

We searched for studies done by June 2021. We found three studies. These studies included 808 people total.

**Who was in the studies?**

All the people lived in nursing homes. All had dementia. Some had mild dementia. Others had severe dementia. The amount of pain people felt was different in each study. One study included people with little or no pain at the start. Two studies included only people with mild to moderate pain.

**What did the studies compare?**

Two studies compared the step-by-step guide to pain education for nurses. One study compared the guide to usual care. Usual care means what nurses normally do.

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies lasted different amounts of time. People stayed in the studies for several weeks or months.

**How did they measure pain?**

In two studies, people told researchers about their own pain if they could. Nurses also watched for signs of pain. They looked at faces, movements, and breathing. In one study, only research team members rated pain. The people with dementia did not report their own pain.

## Results

**What did the studies find?**

The results were mixed. We could not be sure about most findings.

**For people with little or no pain at the start:**

We could not tell if the step-by-step guide helped. We looked at pain reported by people themselves. We also looked at pain judged by nurses. Neither showed clear results. We also could not tell if the guide reduced problem behaviors like hitting or shouting.

**For people with mild to moderate pain at the start:**

When people reported their own pain, the step-by-step guide may not work better than nurse education. When nurses or research staff judged the pain, the guide may work better than usual care. But it may not work better than nurse education alone. However, we are not sure how accurate pain ratings are when someone else makes them.

**Were there any harmful effects?**

No study looked for harmful effects. No study reported that bad things happened.

**Why are we not sure about these results?**

We found only three studies. The studies were different from each other. People started with different levels of pain. They had different levels of dementia. The quality of the studies was not always strong. All of this makes it hard to be certain.

**What does this mean?**

We do not have good proof that step-by-step guides work better than teaching nurses about pain. The guides might work better than usual care. But we need more research to be sure.

**What should happen next?**

More studies are needed. These studies should include more people. They should be done more carefully. This would help us know if step-by-step guides really help people with dementia who are in pain."
10.1002-14651858.CD013340-pls.txt,"Mixed exercise programmes for adults with fibromyalgia
What is fibromyalgia and what is mixed exercise? 
Fibromyalgia is a condition causing chronic pain and soreness throughout the body. People with this condition often feel depressed, tired, and stiff, and have difficulty sleeping. Mixed exercise is defined as regular sessions of two or more types of exercise including aerobic (walking or cycling), strengthening (lifting weights or pulling against resistance bands), or flexibility (stretching) exercise. 
Study characteristics 
Reviewers searched for studies until December 2017, and found 29 studies (2088 people) conducted in 12 different countries. The average age of study participants was 51 years, and 98% were female. The average exercise programme was 14 weeks long with three sessions of 50 to 60 minutes per week. All exercise programmes were fully or partially supervised. Reviewers were most interested in comparing mixed exercise groups to control groups (19 studies; 1065 people). People in control groups either received no treatment or continued their usual care. 
Key results – mixed exercise vs control 
Each outcome below is measured on a scale that goes from 0 to 100, where lower scores are better. 
Health‐related quality of life (HRQL)  
After 5 to 26 weeks, people who exercised were 7% better (3% better to 11% better) or improved by 7 points on a 100 point scale. 
People who exercised rated their HRQL at 49 points.
People in the control group rated their HRQL at 56 points.
Pain  
After 5 to 26 weeks, people who exercised had 5% less pain (1% better to 9% better) or improved by 5 points on a 100 point scale. 
People who exercised rated their pain at 53 points.
People in the control group rated their pain at 58.6 points.
Tiredness  
After 14 to 24 weeks, people who exercised were 13% less tired (8% better to 18% better) or improved by 13 points on a 100 point scale 
People who exercised rated their tiredness at 59 points.
People in the control group rated their tiredness at 72 points.
Stiffness  
After 16 weeks, people who exercised were 7% less stiff (1% better 1 to 12% better) or improved by 7 points on a 100 point scale. 
People who exercised rated their stiffness at 61 points.
People in the control group rated their stiffness at 68 points.
Ability to do daily activities (physical function)  
After 8 to 24 weeks, people who exercised were 11% better (7% to 15%) or improved by 11 points on a 100 point scale. 
People who exercised rated their physical function at 38 points.
People in the control group rated their physical function at 49 points.
Harms ‐ Some participants experienced increased pain, soreness, or tiredness during or after exercise. Studies reported no injuries or other harms. However, reporting of harms was missing or incomplete in many studies. We are uncertain whether risk is increased with exercise. 
Leaving the study early – 11% of control participants left the study early compared with 12% of exercisers. 
Long‐term effects ‐ Analysis of long‐term effects of HRQL showed maintenance of mixed exercise effects at 6 to 12 weeks and at 13 to 26 weeks but not at 27 to 52 weeks. Very low‐quality evidence suggests that it is uncertain whether mixed exercises improve HRQL in the long term. Withdrawals and adverse events were not measured. 
Other ‐ Reviewers found no evidence that the benefits and harms of mixed exercise were any different from education programmes, cognitive‐behavioural training, biofeedback, medication, or other types of exercise. 
Conclusions and quality of evidence 
Mixed exercise may improve HRQL and the ability to do daily activities, may decrease pain and tiredness, and may be acceptable to individuals with fibromyalgia. Low‐quality evidence suggests that mixed exercise may slightly improve stiffness. When compared to other exercise or non‐exercise interventions, we are uncertain about the effects of mixed exercise. Although mixed exercise appears to be well tolerated (similar numbers of people leaving the study across groups), evidence on harms was scarce, so we are uncertain about its safety. Reviewers considered the quality of evidence to be low to moderate because of small numbers of people in the studies, some issues involving study design, and the low quality of results. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Mixed Exercise Programs for Adults with Fibromyalgia

## Plain Title
Can doing different types of exercise together help adults with fibromyalgia feel better?

## Rationale

**What is fibromyalgia?**

Fibromyalgia is a health problem that causes long-lasting pain all over the body. People with fibromyalgia often feel very tired and stiff. They may feel sad or down. They often have trouble sleeping. These problems make daily life hard for people with this condition.

**What is mixed exercise?**

Mixed exercise means doing two or more types of exercise on a regular basis. These types include:
- Aerobic exercise: activities like walking or riding a bike
- Strength exercise: activities like lifting weights or using stretch bands
- Flexibility exercise: activities like stretching

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors wanted to know if mixed exercise could help people with fibromyalgia feel better. They thought that doing different types of exercise together might help reduce pain and improve daily life. This study looked at whether mixed exercise really works and if it is safe for people with fibromyalgia.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 29 different studies from 12 countries. They found information about 2,088 people total. Most of the people in these studies were women (98 out of every 100 people). The average age was 51 years old.

**What did people in the study do?**

Some people did mixed exercise programs. Other people did not exercise or just kept doing their normal activities. The exercise programs lasted about 14 weeks. People exercised 3 times each week. Each session lasted 50 to 60 minutes. A trainer or expert watched over the exercise sessions.

**How long were people in the study?**

Most people stayed in the study for 5 to 26 weeks.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

Researchers measured results on a scale from 0 to 100. Lower numbers mean better results.

**Quality of life got better**

People who exercised felt 7 points better about their overall health and life. People who exercised rated their quality of life at 49 points. People who did not exercise rated theirs at 56 points.

**Pain got better**

People who exercised had 5 points less pain. People who exercised rated their pain at 53 points. People who did not exercise rated their pain at 59 points.

**Tiredness got better**

People who exercised felt 13 points less tired. People who exercised rated their tiredness at 59 points. People who did not exercise rated their tiredness at 72 points.

**Stiffness got better**

People who exercised felt 7 points less stiff. People who exercised rated their stiffness at 61 points. People who did not exercise rated their stiffness at 68 points.

**Daily activities got easier**

People who exercised found daily tasks 11 points easier to do. People who exercised rated their ability to do daily tasks at 38 points. People who did not exercise rated theirs at 49 points.

**Were there any problems?**

Some people felt more pain, soreness, or tiredness during or after exercise. No one got injured. However, many studies did not report all problems clearly. We cannot be sure if exercise causes more problems.

About 12 out of every 100 people who exercised left the study early. About 11 out of every 100 people who did not exercise left early. This means about the same number of people left both groups.

**Did the benefits last?**

The benefits lasted for 6 to 26 weeks after the study ended. After 27 to 52 weeks, we are not sure if benefits continued. More research is needed to know about long-term effects.

**How does mixed exercise compare to other treatments?**

Researchers found no clear difference between mixed exercise and other treatments like education programs, talk therapy, or medicine.

**What do these results mean?**

Mixed exercise may help people with fibromyalgia in several ways. It may improve quality of life and make daily tasks easier. It may reduce pain and tiredness. It may reduce stiffness a little bit. Most people seem able to do mixed exercise without major problems.

However, the quality of this research was low to moderate. This means we need more and better studies to be more certain about these findings."
10.1002-14651858.CD013348.pub2-pls.txt,"Inhibition of blood vessel formation in advanced cervical cancer
What is the aim of this review?The aim of this Cochrane Review is to find out whether vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeting drugs, which inhibit the formation of new blood vessels, can improve survival in women with cervical cancer that has spread to distant sites (metastasised) or has not responded to or come back (recurred) after initial treatment. These drugs include bevacizumab, cediranib, apatinib, pazopanib, anlotinib, and nintedanib. 
Key messagesBevacizumab plus chemotherapy may improve survival and probably increases specific and serious adverse events, including gastrointestinal perforations through the gut wall, blood clot formation (thromboembolic events) in blood vessels, hypertension (increased blood pressure), and bleeding (haemorrhage). 
Cediranib or apatinib plus chemotherapy, or pazopanib alone, may make little to no difference in survival. Pazopanib plus lapatinib may reduce survival. 
What are the main results of the review?We found four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that met our inclusion criteria and enrolled 808 women. 
We found one study, which included 452 women, that assessed the use of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. The inclusion of bevacizumab may improve overall survival and probably increases the incidences of specific and serious adverse events. 
A second study analysed 69 women treated with cediranib plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. Cediranib may make little to no difference in survival, and it is uncertain whether it increases the incidences of specific or serious adverse events. 
Another study with 59 women reported data on the use of apatinib plus chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy) versus chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy alone. Apatinib may make little to no difference in survival, but it exhibited promising efficacy for progression‐free survival. 
We found one study with 228 women that compared pazopanib plus lapatinib versus only lapatinib, or pazopanib versus lapatinib: pazopanib plus lapatinib may reduce survival and probably increases the incidence of hypertension; pazopanib alone may make little to no difference in survival and probably increases the incidence of hypertension. 
Overall the quality (certainty) of the evidence was low, as each comparison included only one study and most studies were small. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing Drugs That Block Blood Vessel Growth in Advanced Cervical Cancer

## Plain Title
Can drugs that stop new blood vessels from forming help women with advanced cervical cancer live longer?

## Rationale

**What is cervical cancer and why is this study important?**

Cervical cancer is a disease that starts in the cervix. The cervix is the lower part of the womb. Some women have cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Other women have cancer that came back after treatment. These situations are very serious.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Cancer tumors need blood to grow. They make new blood vessels to get this blood. Researchers wanted to test drugs that stop new blood vessels from forming. They thought these drugs might help stop the cancer from growing. The drugs tested were bevacizumab, cediranib, apatinib, pazopanib, anlotinib, and nintedanib.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know if these drugs could help women live longer. They also wanted to know if the drugs were safe.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at four different studies. These studies included 808 women total. All the women had cervical cancer that had spread or come back.

**What did the studies test?**

Different studies tested different drugs:
- One study tested bevacizumab plus chemotherapy
- One study tested cediranib plus chemotherapy
- One study tested apatinib plus chemotherapy or radiation treatment
- One study tested pazopanib alone or with another drug called lapatinib

Chemotherapy means cancer-fighting drugs. All studies compared women who got the new drugs to women who did not.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included women with advanced cervical cancer. The cancer had either spread to other body parts or had come back after treatment.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

**Bevacizumab (452 women in one study):**
- Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy may help women live longer
- But it likely causes more serious side effects
- Side effects include holes in the gut wall, blood clots, high blood pressure, and bleeding

**Cediranib (69 women in one study):**
- Cediranib plus chemotherapy may not help women live longer
- Researchers are not sure about side effects

**Apatinib (59 women in one study):**
- Apatinib plus chemotherapy may not help women live much longer
- But it may slow down cancer growth for a while

**Pazopanib (228 women in one study):**
- Pazopanib with lapatinib may actually make women live less long
- It likely causes high blood pressure
- Pazopanib alone may not help women live longer
- It likely causes high blood pressure

**What do these results mean?**

Only bevacizumab showed clear benefits for helping women live longer. But it also caused serious side effects. Doctors and patients need to weigh the benefits against the risks.

The other drugs did not show clear benefits. Some may have caused harm.

**How strong is this evidence?**

The quality of evidence was low. Each drug was tested in only one study. Most studies were small. More research is needed to be sure about these results.

**What are the main conclusions?**

Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy may help some women with advanced cervical cancer live longer. But it causes serious side effects. Women and their doctors should talk about whether the benefits are worth the risks.

The other drugs tested did not show clear benefits. More and larger studies are needed to learn more about these treatments."
10.1002-14651858.CD013352.pub2-pls.txt,"In‐bag manual versus uncontained power morcellation for laparoscopic myomectomy
Review question 
Cochrane authors reviewed the effectiveness and safety of in‐bag manual morcellation compared to uncontained power morcellation during laparoscopic myomectomy. The primary outcome of the review was a composite of intraoperative (during surgery) complications. 
Background 
Myomectomy is a surgical procedure to remove uterine fibroids — also called leiomyomas. These common, non‐cancerous growths usually develop in the uterus during childbearing years, but they can occur at any age. In laparoscopic myomectomy, which is a minimally invasive procedure, the surgeon accesses and removes the fibroids through several small abdominal incisions. 
Laparoscopic myomectomy is the gold standard for women with uterine leiomyomas, but it is difficult to remove large fibroids through the small incisions and tubes (laparoscopes). To overcome this challenge, surgeons developed a technique to break the large fibroids into smaller pieces (morcellation). 
However, power morcellation (using a drill‐like instrument to cut up the fibroids) inside the abdomen may lead to the scattering of the tissues. These tissues may be benign (such as fibroids or endometriosis), but they may also be tissues from an undiagnosed cancer. A strategy to optimise women's safety is to cut up larger fibroids with a scalpel or scissors, inside a bag. 
Study Characteristics 
We included two randomised controlled trials, which enrolled 176 premenopausal women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy; they were randomised to receive either in‐bag manual morcellation (87 women) or uncontained power morcellation (89 women). The literature was searched to 1 July 2019. 
Key results 
Neither study reported complications during or after surgery, including no diagnoses of leiomyosarcoma, for women in either group. 
We are very uncertain whether in‐bag morcellation reduces the total time of the operation, or improves the ease of morcellation. The evidence suggests that the morcellation operative time was slightly longer when the surgeon used in‐bag morcellation. However, the quality of the evidence is very low and we cannot be certain of any of these results. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of very low quality. The main limitations were indirectness (both trials took place in high‐income settings and countries, therefore, our findings are limited to this type of setting), and imprecision (both trials had small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals). 
","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Two Ways to Remove Fibroids During Keyhole Surgery

## Plain Title
Comparing Two Methods to Cut Up and Remove Fibroids During Keyhole Surgery

## Rationale

### What are fibroids and why do they matter?
Fibroids are lumps that grow in the womb. They are not cancer. Many women get fibroids during their childbearing years, but they can happen at any age. Fibroids can cause problems like heavy bleeding, pain, or trouble getting pregnant.

### What is the surgery?
Doctors can remove fibroids through keyhole surgery. This means making small cuts in the belly instead of one large cut. This type of surgery helps women heal faster and have less pain.

### What is the problem?
The small cuts used in keyhole surgery create a challenge. Large fibroids cannot fit through these small openings. Doctors must cut the fibroids into smaller pieces to remove them. This process is called morcellation.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors have used a power tool to cut up fibroids inside the belly. This tool works like a drill. But this method can spread tiny pieces of tissue around the belly. Most of the time, these pieces are harmless. But sometimes, a fibroid might actually be cancer that was not found before surgery. Spreading cancer cells is very dangerous.

### What is the new method?
Some doctors now put the fibroid inside a bag first. Then they cut it up by hand using a knife or scissors. This bag may stop tissue pieces from spreading. Researchers wanted to know if this bag method works as well as the power tool method.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked at two studies that tested these methods. They combined the results from both studies.

### Who was in the studies?
The studies included 176 women total. All women were having keyhole surgery to remove fibroids. All women had not yet gone through menopause. Half of the women (87 women) had their fibroids cut up inside a bag by hand. The other half (89 women) had their fibroids cut up with the power tool without a bag.

### Where did the studies happen?
Both studies took place in wealthy countries with good medical care.

### How long did the studies last?
The studies followed women through their surgery and recovery period.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

**Safety:** Neither study reported any problems during or after surgery. No women in either group had complications. Doctors did not find any hidden cancers in either group.

**Surgery time:** The bag method may take slightly longer to cut up the fibroids. However, researchers are not sure about this finding.

**Ease of use:** Researchers could not tell if one method was easier for surgeons to use than the other.

### What does this mean?
The studies were too small to give clear answers. Both methods appeared safe in these studies. But the studies did not include enough women to know for sure.

### What are the limits of this research?
The quality of the evidence was very low. This means we cannot be certain about the results. The studies had several problems:

- Only a small number of women were in the studies
- Both studies happened in wealthy countries with advanced hospitals
- The results may not apply to other settings
- More research is needed with more women

### What do we still need to know?
Larger studies are needed. These studies should include more women from different types of hospitals and countries. This would help doctors know which method is truly safer and works better.

10.1002-14651858.CD013357.pub2-pls.txt,"Silicone gel sheeting for treating hypertrophic scars
Background 
A scar is a mark left on the skin after a wound or injury has healed, for example, after surgery or after a burn. Most scars will fade and become paler over time, but some scars may become red and raised (called hypertrophic scars). Hypertrophic scars may take several years to flatten and fade. 
Scars can be itchy, painful or unsightly, and may restrict movement. Scarring can affect people physically and emotionally, and can affect a person's well‐being. 
Treatments aim to improve a scar’s appearance and help to make it less visible. They include: wearing clothing that fits tightly around the skin (pressure garments); treatments applied to the scar; laser therapy and silicone gel sheets. 
Silicone gel sheets are soft wound dressings containing an elastic form of silicone. They have a soft, rubbery texture and stick to the skin. They are commonly used on healing skin to help soften and flatten a hypertrophic scar. 
What did we want to find out? 
In this Cochrane Review, we wanted to find out how well silicone gel sheets worked in treating hypertrophic scars. 
Our methods 
We searched for studies that investigated the use of silicone gel sheets to treat hypertrophic scars. We searched for randomised controlled trials only, in which the treatment each person receives is chosen at random. These studies give the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. 
What we found 
We found 13 studies with 468 people (425 of them completed the study) with hypertrophic scars caused by surgery, injury, burns or scalding. The studies compared the effects of silicone gel sheets with: giving no treatment with silicone gel sheets; wearing pressure garments; applying silicone gel or onion extract; polyurethane dressings; steroid injections;  laser therapy; intense pulsed light or Gecko Nanoplast (a silicone gel bandage). 
All studies were conducted in hospitals, in Europe (6 studies), China (2), the USA (1), Canada (1), Iran (1), Turkey (1) and India (1). They lasted for different lengths of time: from 3 months to 12 months. 
Four studies reported assessments of scars by healthcare professionals in way that was usable for this review. No studies reported useful results for the person's own assessment of their scar after treatment. 
No studies reported useful results for people's well‐being (quality of life): for whether people stayed on the treatment (adherence), whether the treatments had any unwanted effects; or whether the treatments were cost‐effective (the benefits of treatment outweighed any extra costs). 
The studies did not give enough information to compare silicone gel sheets with steroid injections, laser therapy or pulsed light. 
What are the main results of our review? 
Silicone gel sheets may slightly improve the appearance of hypertrophic scars compared with onion extract.  We are uncertain whether silicone gel sheets improve a scar's appearance better than no treatment with silicone gel sheets, or silicone gel, or polyurethane.  
Silicone gel sheets may reduce pain levels compared with pressure garments. Silicone gel sheets may also result in a slight reduction in pain levels compared with no treatment with silicone gel sheets. We are uncertain whether silicone gel sheets decrease pain compared with self‐adhesive propylene glycol and hydroxyethyl cellulose sheeting.  The evidence is also very uncertain about the effect of silicone gel sheets on pain compared with Gecko Nanoplast. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Our certainty (confidence) in the evidence was low, or very low. The evidence we found comes from a few studies (sometimes only one), often in small numbers of people, with poorly reported results, so we are not sure how reliable the results are. We therefore think our conclusions would be likely to change if results from further studies become available. 
Conclusions 
We are uncertain about whether silicone gel sheets work better than most other treatments for hypertrophic scars. Silicone gel sheets may improve the appearance of scars slightly compared with applying onion extract, and may reduce pain compared with no treatment with silicone gel sheets or pressure garments. 
Search date 
This review includes evidence published up to 21 April 2021.
","# Plain Language Summary: Silicone Gel Sheets for Treating Raised Scars

## Plain Title
Do silicone gel sheets help treat raised scars?

## Rationale

### What are scars and why do they matter?
A scar is a mark left on your skin after a wound heals. This can happen after surgery, a burn, or an injury. Most scars fade and become lighter over time. But some scars become red and raised. These are called raised scars or hypertrophic scars. These raised scars may take several years to flatten and fade.

### Why are scars a problem?
Scars can cause many problems. They can itch or hurt. They may look bad to the person who has them. Sometimes scars make it hard to move. Scars can affect how people feel about themselves. They can affect a person's daily life and happiness.

### What treatments exist?
Doctors use different treatments to help scars look better and be less visible. Some people wear tight clothing called pressure garments. Other treatments include creams or gels put on the scar. Doctors also use laser therapy. Another common treatment is silicone gel sheets.

### What are silicone gel sheets?
Silicone gel sheets are soft bandages that contain a rubbery form of silicone. They feel soft and stick to your skin. Doctors often use them on healing skin. The goal is to help soften and flatten raised scars.

### Why was this study needed?
Researchers wanted to know if silicone gel sheets really work. They wanted to find out how well these sheets treat raised scars. This information helps doctors and patients choose the best treatment.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked for studies that tested silicone gel sheets. They only used studies where people got treatments chosen at random. This type of study gives the most reliable results.

### Who was in the studies?
The researchers found 13 studies with 468 people. Of these people, 425 finished their studies. All people in the studies had raised scars. These scars came from surgery, injury, burns, or scalding.

### Where did the studies happen?
All studies took place in hospitals. Six studies were in Europe. Two were in China. One each was in the USA, Canada, Iran, Turkey, and India.

### What did the studies compare?
The studies compared silicone gel sheets with other treatments. These included no treatment, pressure garments, silicone gel, onion extract, other types of bandages, steroid shots, laser therapy, and other light treatments.

### How long did the studies last?
The studies lasted different amounts of time. The shortest was 3 months. The longest was 12 months.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
The researchers found limited information. Only four studies reported results that could be used. These studies looked at how doctors rated the scars. No studies gave useful information about how patients rated their own scars. No studies reported useful results about quality of life, whether people stayed on treatment, side effects, or cost.

### Main findings about scar appearance
Silicone gel sheets may slightly improve how scars look compared with onion extract. The researchers are not sure if silicone gel sheets work better than no treatment, silicone gel, or other bandages.

### Main findings about pain
Silicone gel sheets may reduce pain compared with pressure garments. They may also reduce pain slightly compared with no treatment. The researchers are not sure if silicone gel sheets reduce pain compared with some other bandages.

### How reliable are these results?
The researchers have low confidence in these results. The evidence comes from only a few studies. These studies had small numbers of people. The results were not well reported. This means the results may not be reliable. If more studies are done, the conclusions might change.

### What do the results mean?
The researchers are not sure if silicone gel sheets work better than most other treatments. Silicone gel sheets may improve how scars look slightly compared with onion extract. They may reduce pain compared with no treatment or pressure garments. More research is needed to know for sure."

Why is improving the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis important? 
In 2018, at least one million children became ill with tuberculosis and around 200,000 died. When detected early and effectively treated, tuberculosis is largely curable. Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra are World Health Organization‐recommended tests that simultaneously detect tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults and children with tuberculosis symptoms. Rifampicin is an important anti‐tuberculosis drug. Not recognizing tuberculosis early may result in delayed diagnosis and treatment, severe illness, and death. A false tuberculosis diagnosis may result in anxiety and unnecessary treatment. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To determine the accuracy of tests in symptomatic children for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, and rifampicin resistance. 
What was studied in this review? 
Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra, with results measured against culture and a composite reference standard (benchmarks), recognizing that neither reference is perfect in children. 
What are the main results in this review? 
A total of 49 studies were included. For pulmonary tuberculosis, we analysed 299 data sets including information describing nearly 70,000 children. 
For a population of 1000 children:
Xpert MTB/RIF 
‐ where 100 have pulmonary tuberculosis in sputum (by culture), 74 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 9 (12%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); 926 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative; and 35 (4%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives) 
‐ where 100 have tuberculous meningitis (by culture), 86 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 59 (69%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); 914 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative; and 23 (3%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives) 
‐ where 100 people have lymph node tuberculosis (by culture), 142 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 97 (68%) would not have lymph node tuberculosis (false‐positives); 858 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative; and 5 (1%) would have lymph node TB (false‐negatives) 
‐ where 100 have rifampicin resistance, 108 would have Xpert MTB/RIF‐rifampicin resistance detected, of whom 18 (17%) would not have rifampicin resistance (false‐positives); 892 would have Xpert MTB/RIF‐rifampicin resistance NOT detected; and 10 (1%) would have rifampicin resistance (false‐negatives) 
Xpert Ultra 
‐ where 100 have pulmonary tuberculosis in sputum (by culture), 100 would be Xpert Ultra‐positive, of whom 27 (27%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); 900 would be Xpert Ultra‐negative; and 27 (3%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives) 
How confident are we in the results of this review? 
We are confident. We included many studies from different countries and settings and used two reference standards. Some studies included only children at referral centres or did not report the setting. Therefore, we could not assess how the tests would work in a primary care setting. 
What children do the results of this review apply to? 
Children with presumed pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, or rifampicin resistance. 
What are the implications of this review? 
The results of the review suggest Xpert tests have the potential to be used to detect tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. 
‐ The risk of missing a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis confirmed by culture with Xpert MTB/RIF (in sputum) is low (4% of those whose Xpert MTB/RIF suggests they do not have tuberculosis) suggesting that only a small number of children with tuberculosis confirmed by culture will not receive treatment. The risk of wrongly diagnosing a child as having tuberculosis is slightly higher (12% of those whose Xpert MTB/RIF test suggests they do have tuberculosis). This may result in some of these children receiving unnecessary treatment. 
‐ The risk of missing a diagnosis of rifampicin resistance with Xpert MTB/RIF is low (1% of those whose Xpert MTB/RIF suggests they do not have rifampicin resistance) suggesting that only a small number of children with tuberculosis will not receive the appropriate treatment. The risk of wrongly diagnosing a child as rifampicin resistance tuberculosis is higher (17% of those whose Xpert MTB/RIF test suggests they do have rifampicin resistance). This may result in some of these children receiving unnecessary treatment.

## Plain Title
How Well Do Xpert Tests Find Tuberculosis in Children?

## Rationale

**What is tuberculosis and why does it matter?**

Tuberculosis (also called TB) is a serious infection. It mainly affects the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body. In 2018, at least one million children got sick with TB. Around 200,000 children died from it. TB is a big problem for children around the world.

The good news is that TB can be cured. Doctors can treat TB with special medicines. But children need to start treatment early. When doctors find TB quickly, children have a much better chance of getting well.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors need good tests to find TB in children. Two tests called Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra can help. These tests look for TB germs. They also check if the germs can fight off a key TB medicine called rifampicin. Health experts around the world say doctors should use these tests.

**What happens if TB is missed?**

When doctors miss TB, children may not get treatment. They can get very sick. Some children may die. But wrong test results cause problems too. If a test says a child has TB when they don't, the child may take medicine they don't need. This can cause worry for families.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know how well these tests work in children. They looked at tests for TB in the lungs, TB in the brain covering, TB in lymph nodes, and germs that resist rifampicin medicine.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at 49 other studies that had already been done. They gathered information from nearly 70,000 children. The children in these studies had signs that they might have TB.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included children from many countries. These children had symptoms that made doctors think they might have TB. The studies looked at different types of TB in different parts of the body.

**How did researchers check the tests?**

Researchers compared the Xpert test results to other ways of finding TB. They used culture tests as one way to check. Culture tests grow TB germs in a lab. They also used a mix of different checks together.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The researchers looked at a lot of information. Here is what they found when they tested 1,000 children:

**For TB in the lungs using Xpert MTB/RIF:**
Imagine 100 out of 1,000 children really have TB. The test would find 74 of them. But 9 children would test positive even though they don't have TB. The test would miss 35 children who do have TB.

**For TB in the brain covering using Xpert MTB/RIF:**
If 100 children have this type of TB, the test would be positive in 86 children. But 59 of these children would not really have TB. The test would miss 23 children with TB.

**For TB in lymph nodes using Xpert MTB/RIF:**
If 100 children have this type of TB, 142 tests would be positive. But 97 of these would be wrong. The test would miss only 5 children with TB.

**For germs that resist rifampicin medicine:**
If 100 children have resistant germs, 108 tests would show resistance. But 18 of these would be wrong. The test would miss 10 children with resistant germs.

**For TB in the lungs using Xpert Ultra:**
If 100 children have TB, 100 tests would be positive. But 27 of these children would not have TB. The test would miss 27 children with TB.

**What do these results mean?**

These tests can help doctors find TB in children. The tests are good at finding TB in the lungs. They rarely miss children who have TB. But sometimes the tests say a child has TB when they don't. This means some children might get treatment they don't need.

The tests are also good at finding germs that resist medicine. They rarely miss resistant germs. But again, sometimes the tests are wrong.

**Why are these findings important?**

These tests give doctors a useful tool. They can help find TB quickly. Quick treatment can save lives. The tests work in many different places and settings.

**What should doctors and families know?**

No test is perfect. These tests are helpful but not perfect. Doctors should use these tests along with other information about the child. This helps them make the best choices for treatment.

The studies show these tests can make a real difference for children with TB."
10.1002-14651858.CD013365.pub2-pls.txt,"CAR T‐cell therapy for people with diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma which returns after treatment or no longer responds to treatment 
Background 
Diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a fast‐growing cancer of the lymphatic system, an important part of the immune system. It affects blood cells that produce antibodies to fight infections. 
DLBCL is potentially curable. Most people with DLBCL respond well to initial therapies such as chemotherapy. For some people, the disease becomes refractory, which means it no longer responds to treatment, or it relapses, which means it returns after treatment. As a second‐line treatment, people with DLBCL can receive chemotherapy coupled with stem‐cell transplantation, but not all people are candidates for this therapy. From those who are, around 50% experience relapse after treatment. People who relapse or are refractory to advanced lines of treatment and those who are not candidates for a stem‐cell transplant have a very poor prognosis: Only half of them survive longer than six to 12 months. 
A promising treatment for these people is 'chimeric antigen receptor' (CAR) T‐cell therapy, which utilises the body's own immune cells (T‐cells) to fight DLBCL. T‐cells are removed from the person's blood, equipped with so‐called 'chimeric antigen receptors' (CARs), that help to recognise and destroy the cancer cells, in the laboratory and then delivered back into the person's blood. 
What was our aim? 
We wanted to explore whether CAR T‐cells are an effective treatment for people with DLBCL that returns after treatment (relapses) or no longer responds to treatment (is refractory). We also wanted to explore the frequency of unwanted effects associated with CAR T‐cell therapy. 
What did we do? 
We searched for all available clinical studies on treatment with CAR T‐cells for people with relapsed or refractory DLBCL to summarise the current evidence. We also evaluated the risk of bias in included studies and rated our confidence in the evidence. 
What did we find? 
We found 13 studies with information on 679 participants (who had received several prior lines of therapy) that received CAR T‐cell therapy. None of the studies had a control group. This means CAR T‐cells were not compared with another treatment. We decided not to meta‐analyse the study results and reported all results narratively. We also found 38 ongoing studies. 
What are the key results? 
Eight studies with 567 participants evaluated overall survival. After 12 months, around half of participants were alive in four studies. In one study, around half of participants were alive after 24 months. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cells on survival. 
Two studies (294 participants at study start; 59 participants at study end) reported that quality of life improved over time. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cells on quality of life. 
Deaths related to the therapy were not reported.
Five studies (550 participants) reported on adverse events. Almost all participants (99% to 100%) experienced some kind of adverse event (including mild events). Between 68% and 98% of participants had adverse events that were severe. CAR T‐cells may increase the risk of adverse events but the evidence about the exact risk is very uncertain. 
In three studies (253 participants), 56% to 68% of participants experienced serious adverse events, while in one study (28 participants), participants had no serious adverse events. CAR T‐cells may increase the risk of serious adverse events but the evidence about the exact risk is very uncertain. 
Eleven studies (675 participants) reported on the frequency of 'cytokine release syndrome' (CRS), an overreaction of the immune system that is typically seen in CAR T‐cell therapy. It includes fever and can include symptoms such as chills, muscle pain or dizziness. Several scales were used across the studies to describe CRS. In five studies using the same scale, between 42% and 100% of participants had CRS. CAR T‐cells may increase the risk of CRS but the evidence about the exact risk is very uncertain. 
Nine studies (575 participants) reported when DLBCL relapsed (returned) or progressed (got worse). Four studies reported that, at 12 months, DLBCL did not progress in 44% to 75% of participants. In one study, 64% of participants did not relapse at both 12, and 18 months. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cells on DLBCL relapse or progress. 
Thirteen studies (620 participants) reported how many participants had a complete response (all signs of cancer disappeared). In three studies, between 40% and 45% of participants experienced a complete response at six months. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cells on complete response. 
What does this mean? 
The evidence on CAR T‐cells in the treatment of relapsed or refractory DLBCL is very uncertain. This is mainly because, today, there are no direct comparisons of CAR T‐cells with other treatments. People who receive CAR T‐cells can have severe adverse events that require additional treatment. We identified many ongoing studies and some of them compare CAR T‐cells with standard care. We will keep evaluating the evidence on this novel therapy. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence is current to September 2020.
","# Plain Language Summary: CAR T-Cell Therapy for Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma

## Plain Title

Testing a New Treatment Called CAR T-Cells for People with a Blood Cancer That Came Back or Stopped Responding to Treatment

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a fast-growing blood cancer. It affects the body's infection-fighting system. The cancer attacks special blood cells that help fight germs.

**What happens to patients?**

Most people get better with the first treatment. But for some people, the cancer comes back. For others, the treatment stops working. These people can try a second treatment. This includes strong drugs and a stem-cell transplant. But not everyone can have this treatment. About half of people who do have it see their cancer come back. When the cancer returns or stops responding, patients have very poor outcomes. Only half of these people live longer than 6 to 12 months.

**What is the new treatment?**

CAR T-cell therapy is a promising new treatment. It uses the body's own defense cells to fight cancer. Here is how it works:
- Doctors take special cells called T-cells from the patient's blood
- In a lab, they add new parts to these cells
- These new parts help the cells find and kill cancer cells
- Doctors put these changed cells back into the patient's blood

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if CAR T-cells work for people whose cancer came back or stopped responding. They also wanted to know what side effects patients might have.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

Researchers looked for all studies about CAR T-cells for DLBCL. They found 13 studies with 679 people. All these people had tried several treatments before. None of the studies compared CAR T-cells to other treatments. Everyone in the studies got CAR T-cells. The researchers also found 38 studies still happening now.

**Who was in the studies?**

All participants had DLBCL that came back or stopped responding to treatment. They had already tried other treatments that did not work.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The researchers are very uncertain about how well CAR T-cells work. Here is what they found:

**Survival:**
Eight studies looked at how long people lived. In four studies, about half of people were alive after 12 months. In one study, about half were alive after 24 months.

**Quality of life:**
Two studies asked people about their quality of life. People said their quality of life got better over time.

**Side effects:**
Almost all people (99 out of 100) had some side effects. Many side effects were serious. Between 68 and 98 out of 100 people had severe side effects.

Between 56 and 68 out of 100 people had serious side effects in three studies. In one small study, no one had serious side effects.

**Cytokine release syndrome:**
This is a common side effect of CAR T-cells. The body's defense system reacts too strongly. Symptoms include fever, chills, muscle pain, and dizziness. Between 42 and 100 out of 100 people had this side effect.

**Cancer response:**
In three studies, between 40 and 45 out of 100 people had all signs of cancer disappear at six months. In four studies, the cancer did not get worse in 44 to 75 out of 100 people at 12 months.

**What do the results mean?**

The evidence about CAR T-cells is very uncertain. This is because no studies compared CAR T-cells to other treatments. People who get CAR T-cells can have serious side effects. These side effects need extra treatment.

**What happens next?**

Many studies are happening now. Some compare CAR T-cells to standard treatments. Researchers will keep studying this new treatment.

**Note:** This review includes information up to September 2020."
10.1002-14651858.CD013367.pub2-pls.txt,"Humour‐based interventions for people with schizophrenia
Review question 
Are humour‐based interventions effective in treating people with schizophrenia?
Background 
Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness. It is a disorder of thought, namely firm fixed false beliefs despite there being evidence to the contrary, loss of reality ties, and altered perception. These symptoms are further classified as (i) positive symptoms, such as speech without order, illusions or mistaken and persistent ideas; and (ii) negative symptoms, a lack of emotion or restricted quantity of speech; and decline in cognitive function, including attention, memory, and behavior control. The standard treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications. Treatment with humour‐based interventions, such as watching humorous movies, funny videos, or comedies, has been proposed as an add‐on treatment that promotes health and wellness by stimulating a playful discovery, expression, or appreciation of the irrationality or inconsistency of life's situations. 
Searching for evidence 
We ran an electronic search in February 2021 for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive humour‐based interventions in addition to usual care, or to receive usual care only, another psychological intervention or a control condition. We found eight records and checked them for suitability to include in our review. 
Evidence found 
Three trials met the review requirements and two low‐quality trials (total number of participants = 96) provided useable data. Compared with active control, humour‐based interventions may not improve positive symptoms and anxiety, but may improve depressive symptoms. However, when compared with standard care, humour‐based intervention may not improve the depressive symptoms. Current evidence is very limited and is of low to very low quality. We are uncertain as to whether humour‐based interventions may lead to clinically‐important improvement in mental state or quality of life in people with schizophrenia. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient research evidence to support the use of humour‐based interventions in people with schizophrenia. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Humour-Based Treatments for People with Schizophrenia

## Plain Title
Can watching funny movies and videos help treat people with schizophrenia?

## Rationale

**What is schizophrenia?**

Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness. It affects how a person thinks and sees the world. People with schizophrenia may have strong beliefs that are not true. They may lose touch with reality. They may see or hear things that are not there.

**What are the symptoms?**

Doctors group the symptoms into two types. Positive symptoms include confused speech, seeing things that are not real, and false beliefs. Negative symptoms include showing little emotion and speaking very little. People may also have trouble with memory, paying attention, and controlling their behavior.

**How is schizophrenia usually treated?**

Doctors usually treat schizophrenia with medicines called antipsychotics. These medicines help control the symptoms.

**What is humour-based treatment?**

Some doctors think that humour might help too. Humour-based treatment means watching funny movies, comedy shows, or humorous videos. The idea is that laughter and humour can help people feel better. Humour helps people see the funny side of life's problems. It may improve health and wellness when added to regular treatment.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Researchers wanted to know if humour-based treatments really work. They wanted to see if watching funny content could help people with schizophrenia feel better. This could give doctors a new way to help their patients.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked for all studies that tested humour-based treatments. They searched medical databases in February 2021. They looked for studies that compared two groups of people. One group got humour-based treatment plus usual care. The other group got only usual care or a different treatment.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included people with schizophrenia. The review found eight possible studies. Only three studies met the requirements for good research. Of these three, only two studies had data the researchers could use. These two studies included 96 people total.

**How long did the studies last?**

The abstract does not give details about how long people stayed in each study.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The researchers found very limited evidence. The quality of the studies was low to very low. This means the results may not be reliable.

When compared to active control treatments, humour-based treatments showed mixed results. They may not help with positive symptoms like confused thinking. They may not reduce anxiety. However, they may help reduce feelings of sadness or depression.

When compared to standard care alone, humour-based treatments may not help with depression.

**What does this mean for patients?**

Right now, we cannot be sure if humour-based treatments really help. We do not know if they improve mental state. We do not know if they improve quality of life for people with schizophrenia.

**What do the researchers conclude?**

There is not enough good research evidence yet. Doctors cannot recommend humour-based treatments based on current studies. More and better research is needed. Future studies should include more people. They should be better designed. Only then can we know if watching funny content truly helps people with schizophrenia.

**Why is this important?**

This review shows we need more research. Humour-based treatments seem safe and easy to use. But we must prove they work before doctors can recommend them. Patients and families should know that current evidence does not support using humour as a treatment for schizophrenia."
10.1002-14651858.CD013373.pub2-pls.txt,"When healthcare consumers (patients, carers and family members) and healthcare providers work together as partners to plan, deliver and evaluate health services, what effects does this have? 
What are person‐centred health services? 
Traditionally, health services have been developed by healthcare providers and focus on specific diseases or medical specialties. Involving consumers as partners in planning, delivering and evaluating health services may lead to services that are better able to meet the needs of and provide care for individuals.  
Why we did this Cochrane review 
Governments worldwide recommend that healthcare providers work with consumers to promote person‐centred health services. However, the effects of healthcare providers and consumers working together are unclear. 
We reviewed the evidence from research studies to find out about the effects of healthcare providers and consumers working together to plan, deliver and evaluate health services. 
Specifically, we wanted to know if consumers and healthcare providers working together in partnership – in the form of regular meetings in which consumers and providers were invited to contribute as equals to decisions about health services – had an impact on: 
‐ changes to health services;
‐ the extent to which changes to health services reflected service users’ priorities;
‐ users’ ratings of health services;
‐ health service use; and
‐ time and money needed to make or act on decisions about health services.
We also wanted to find out if there were any unwanted (adverse) effects.    
What did we do? 
First, we searched the medical literature for studies that compared:
‐ consumers and healthcare providers working in partnership against usual practice or other strategies with no partnership; or 
‐ different ways of working in partnership (for example, with fewer or more consumers, or with online or face‐to‐face meetings). 
We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. 
What did we find? 
We found five studies that involved a total of 16,257 health service users and more than 469 health service providers. Three studies took place in high income‐countries and one each in middle‐ and low‐income countries. 
The studies compared:
‐ working in partnership against usual practice without partnership working (2 studies); and 
‐ working in partnership as part of a wider strategy to promote person‐centred health services, against the same wider strategy without partnership working (3 studies).   
No studies evaluated one form of working in partnership compared to another.
What are the main results of our review? 
The studies provided insufficient evidence to determine if working in partnership had any effects compared to usual practice or wider strategies with no working in partnership. 
No studies investigated:
‐ impacts on the extent to which changes to health services reflected service users’ priorities, or 
‐ the resources needed to make or act on decisions about health services.
Few studies investigated:
‐ impacts on changes to health services;
‐ users’ ratings of health services;
‐ health service use; and
‐ adverse events.
The few studies that did investigate these outcomes either did not report usable information or produced findings in which we have very little confidence. These studies were small, used methods likely to introduce errors in their results and focused on specific settings or populations. Their results are unlikely to reflect the results of all the studies that have been conducted in this area, some of which have not made their results public yet. 
What does this mean? 
There is not enough robust evidence to determine the effects of consumers and providers working in partnership to plan, deliver or evaluate health services. 
This review highlights the need for well‐designed studies with a clear focus on evaluating the effects of partnerships for promoting person‐centred care in health services. This area of research may also benefit from studies that investigate why certain partnerships between consumers and healthcare providers may be more successful than others, and an accompanying qualitative evidence synthesis addressing this aspect is forthcoming. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to April 2019.

## Plain Title
Working Together: What Happens When Patients and Healthcare Workers Team Up to Plan Health Services?

## Rationale

### What is the issue?
Health services have usually been planned by doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers. These services often focus on specific diseases or medical problems. But the people who use these services—patients and their families—may have different needs and ideas about what good care looks like.

### Why did researchers do this study?
Governments around the world now say that healthcare workers should work with patients as equal partners. This means patients should help plan, run, and check health services. When patients and healthcare workers team up, services might better meet what people actually need.

However, no one knew for sure if this teamwork actually helps. Researchers wanted to find out what happens when patients and healthcare workers work together as partners.

### What did researchers want to learn?
The researchers looked for answers to these questions:
- Do health services change when patients and workers team up?
- Do these changes match what patients say they need?
- Do patients rate services better?
- Do people use health services more or less?
- Does teamwork cost more time or money?
- Are there any problems caused by this teamwork?

## Trial Design

### How did researchers study this?
The researchers searched for studies that tested teamwork between patients and healthcare workers. They looked for studies where patients and workers met regularly. In these meetings, everyone had an equal say in decisions about health services.

The researchers compared these teamwork approaches to:
- Usual care with no teamwork
- Other ways of working with no teamwork
- Different types of teamwork

### Who was in these studies?
The researchers found five studies. These studies included:
- More than 16,000 people who use health services
- At least 469 healthcare workers

Three studies happened in wealthy countries. One study was in a middle-income country. One study was in a low-income country.

### What did the studies compare?
- Two studies compared teamwork to usual care with no teamwork
- Three studies compared teamwork as part of a bigger plan to usual care with no teamwork

No studies compared different types of teamwork to each other.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
The researchers could not tell if teamwork between patients and healthcare workers makes any difference. The studies did not provide enough good information to answer this question.

### What was missing?
The studies did not look at:
- Whether changes matched what patients wanted
- How much time or money teamwork requires

Only a few studies looked at:
- Changes to health services
- How patients rated services
- How much people used services
- Problems caused by teamwork

### Why were the results unclear?
The studies that did look at these things had problems:
- The studies were small
- The way they were done could have led to mistakes
- They only looked at specific places or groups of people
- The results may not show the full picture

The researchers have very little confidence in the findings from these studies.

### What does this mean?
Right now, there is not enough solid proof to know if patients and healthcare workers teaming up actually helps. More research is needed.

### What should happen next?
Researchers need to do better studies. These studies should:
- Be designed more carefully
- Focus clearly on what teamwork does
- Look at why some teamwork succeeds and other teamwork fails

### How current is this information?
This review includes all studies published up to April 2019.

10.1002-14651858.CD013376.pub2-pls.txt,"Reducing aflatoxin intake with agricultural and nutritional education to improve growth of infants and children in low‐ and middle‐income countries 
Review question 
Does providing agricultural and nutritional education about how to reduce the intake of aflatoxins (from contaminated food crops) in households and communities in low and middle‐income countries (LMICs) improve the growth of infants and children compared to usual or no education? 
Background 
Aflatoxins are toxins produced by moulds that contaminate food crops. Maize and groundnuts are the major dietary sources of aflatoxins, as they are eaten in large amounts by many people living in LMICs. Some research from LMICs suggests that there may be a link between aflatoxin intake during pregnancy and early childhood, and growth in infants and young children. 
Study Characteristics 
We included three trials, conducted in pregnant and breastfeeding women (1168 mother‐child pairs), women of childbearing age (N = 231), and infants and young children (< 59 months old), from rural, subsistence maize‐farming communities in Kenya, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. One trial in Tanzania, at unclear risk of bias overall, provided data for this review, since one trial did not report any outcomes relevant to this review, and we were unable to obtain unpublished growth data for another, even after contacting the study authors. 
The trial, conducted in breastfeeding women and their babies, studied the effects of agricultural education (demonstrations to change farmers' practices after harvesting their maize crops to reduce aflatoxins (for example, by handsorting and de‐hulling the maize, using drying sheets and insecticides) on the babies' weight, standardised for age (weight‐for‐age z‐score (WAZ)), after six months (the z‐score measures the difference between these babies and the median of a population of similar babies). Farmers in the control group received routine services from agriculture extension workers. 
Key results 
Very low‐certainty evidence from one trial suggested that the WAZ of 128 children from farmers' households who received agricultural education may improve by a z‐score of 0.57, compared to 121 children from households where farmers only received routine services. This means that a baby girl in the intervention group, with a healthy weight, would gain about 450 to 690 grams more weight between three to nine months, compared to a baby girl in the control group. This is a meaningful difference. 
Another way of measuring the effect is to compare the proportion of underweight infants (WAZ ≥ 2 standard deviations below the reference median value) per group, after the intervention. In this case, agricultural education may reduce the proportion of underweight children, on average, by 6.7% (very low‐certainty evidence), compared to routine services. 
None of the included studies addressed the effects of nutritional education on length of height, or on unintended effects of agricultural or nutritional education. 
Evidence about the effects on child growth of agricultural or nutritional education interventions that reduce aflatoxin exposure in LMICs was very limited. Data from one trial suggested that agricultural education, aimed at changing farmers' post‐harvest practices to reduce aflatoxin exposure, may result in the babies' increased weight‐for‐age, compared to usual or no education. 
The literature was searched to August 2019.
Quality of the evidence 
We have very little confidence in the results. The true effect may be substantially different.

## Plain Title
Can Teaching Farmers and Families About Harmful Mold in Food Help Babies and Young Children Grow Better?

## Rationale

### What is the problem?
Some types of mold grow on food crops like corn and peanuts. These molds make harmful substances called aflatoxins. Many families in poorer countries eat corn and peanuts as main foods. This means they may eat aflatoxins often.

### Why does this matter?
Scientists think aflatoxins might stop babies and young children from growing well. When pregnant women or young children eat food with aflatoxins, it may affect how much the children grow and gain weight.

### What did researchers want to find out?
Researchers wanted to know if teaching people could help. They looked at two types of teaching:
- Teaching farmers how to handle crops after harvest to reduce mold
- Teaching families about food and nutrition to avoid aflatoxins

The main question was: Does this teaching help babies and young children grow better?

### Why might this work?
If farmers learn better ways to dry and store their crops, less mold might grow. If families learn which foods have less mold, they might make better choices. This could mean less aflatoxin in the food that pregnant women and young children eat.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked for studies done in poorer countries. They found three studies from Kenya, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. These studies were done in farming areas where families grow corn for food.

### Who was in the studies?
The studies included:
- Pregnant women and mothers who were breastfeeding (1,168 mother-child pairs)
- Women who could have children (231 women)
- Babies and young children under 5 years old

All families lived in rural areas. They grew corn as their main crop.

### What did the study do?
One study in Tanzania gave useful information. Farmers learned new ways to handle corn after harvest. They learned to:
- Sort corn by hand to remove bad pieces
- Remove the outer shell of corn
- Use special sheets for drying corn
- Use products to keep insects away

Other farmers only got regular help from farm workers. This was the control group.

### How long did the study last?
The researchers checked the babies' weight after six months.

## Results

### What did researchers find?
Only one study had results the researchers could use. The evidence quality was very low. This means we cannot be very sure about the results.

### Main findings about weight:
Babies whose families got the special teaching gained more weight. On average, they gained about 450 to 690 grams more than babies in the control group. This happened between 3 and 9 months of age. This extra weight gain is important for a baby's health.

### Findings about underweight babies:
The teaching may have helped reduce underweight babies. About 7 fewer babies out of every 100 were underweight in the teaching group. This is compared to the control group.

### What was not studied:
The studies did not look at:
- How tall or long children grew
- Any bad effects from the teaching programs

### What do the results mean?
Teaching farmers better ways to handle corn after harvest might help babies gain more weight. However, researchers need more studies to be sure. The evidence is very limited right now.

### Why is the evidence uncertain?
Only one study gave useful results. The study had some problems with how it was done. More research is needed to know if these teaching programs really work.

### When was this research done?
Researchers looked at all studies published up to August 2019.

10.1002-14651858.CD013379.pub2-pls.txt,"Strategies to help adults with a breathing tube to communicate
What is the issue? 
Patients needing a machine to support breathing cannot speak due to a tube delivering gas to the lungs bypassing their voice box. Patients mouth words, gesture, and use facial expressions. However, these are very difficult to understand. Weakened muscles and difficulty concentrating, which are common in critical illness, makes using aids such as writing equipment or communication boards difficult. Consistent evidence on which communication aids are effective is lacking. 
Why is this important? 
Difficulty communicating places people at increased risk of harm, causes distress to patients and family, and causes stress for healthcare staff. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for studies (to 30 July 2020) exploring aids used to help people with a breathing tube to communicate. We found 11 studies involving 1931 participants admitted to intensive care units. We also looked for studies involving people needing a breathing tube and living at home or in long‐term care, but found none. Eight studies used communication boards or apps. Three studies used aids that help a patient to speak with the breathing tube in place. All studies compared the communication aid to routine communication practices. For six studies, routine practice did not include use of any type of communication aid. For the remaining five studies, usual care comprised a range of communication aids routinely used in the participating intensive care units including a communication board, paper notepad, and routine timing of the use of speech aids. We are unsure about whether the early use of aids to help with speaking may increase the number of people who can say words that can be understood or shorten the time to be able to speak. The evidence was of very low quality. 
Similarly, compared to routine care in which an aid is not used, we are uncertain about the effects of communication boards on patient satisfaction. We are not sure about the effect on psychological distress and quality of life due to uncertainty in the evidence. Communication aids that help people to speak may have little or no effect on intensive care unit length of stay (low‐quality evidence). We are uncertain of possible harms  with use of communication aids as only three studies reported this, and all measured different adverse events, and two were very small studies. 
What does this mean? 
We are unsure whether using speaking aids in intensive care might increase the number of people who can say words that can be understood. Use of communication boards may increase patient satisfaction, but we are not sure of these findings because of very low‐quality evidence. This means further studies are likely to change our understanding of the effects of communication aids. More studies are needed to understand the effects of communication aids, particularly effects on psychological well‐being and people's ability to communicate.

## Plain Title
Can Communication Tools Help People on Breathing Machines Talk Better?

## Rationale

**What is the problem?**

Some people get very sick and need a machine to help them breathe. This machine uses a tube that goes into their lungs. The tube goes past the voice box. This means the person cannot talk.

These patients try to share what they need. They move their lips without sound. They use hand movements. They make faces. But other people have trouble knowing what they mean.

Being very sick makes muscles weak. It is also hard to focus and think clearly. This makes it hard to write or point to pictures on a board.

**Why does this matter?**

Not being able to talk causes big problems. Patients may not get the care they need. This can hurt them. Patients feel upset and scared. Their families feel worried and sad. Doctors and nurses feel stressed too.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors do not know which tools work best to help these patients talk. This study looked at the research to find out which communication tools help the most.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this?**

Researchers looked for studies done by July 30, 2020. They wanted to find studies that tested communication tools. These tools were for people on breathing machines.

They found 11 studies. These studies included 1,931 people. All these people were in intensive care units. These are special hospital rooms for very sick people.

Researchers looked for studies of people on breathing machines at home. They did not find any.

**What tools did the studies test?**

Eight studies tested boards with pictures or words. Some tested apps on tablets or phones.

Three studies tested special tools. These tools help a person speak even with the tube in place.

All studies compared the tools to normal care. In six studies, normal care meant no special tools at all. In five studies, normal care included some tools that the hospital already used. These included picture boards, paper and pen, or speech tools used at certain times.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers could not be sure about most results. This is because the quality of the studies was very low.

**About speaking tools:**

The studies looked at whether speech tools helped people say words others could understand. They also looked at how long it took before people could speak. The researchers are not sure if these tools help. The evidence was not strong enough.

**About picture boards and apps:**

The studies looked at whether patients felt more satisfied when using boards or apps. The researchers are not sure if these tools make patients happier. 

The studies also looked at stress, worry, and quality of life. Again, the researchers cannot be sure about the effects. The evidence was too weak.

**About hospital stay:**

Speech tools may not change how long people stay in intensive care. But this evidence was low quality.

**About safety:**

Only three studies looked at whether the tools caused any harm. Each study measured different things. Two studies were very small. The researchers cannot be sure if the tools are completely safe or if they cause problems.

**What does this mean?**

We do not know for certain if communication tools help people on breathing machines. The tools might help patients feel more satisfied. But we need better studies to be sure.

Future studies need to answer important questions. Do these tools help people share what they need? Do the tools reduce worry and fear? Do they improve well-being?

Right now, doctors cannot be certain which tools work best. More research will help doctors know how to help these patients communicate better."
10.1002-14651858.CD013381.pub2-pls.txt,"Which approaches help people with COPD to maintain taking medication as prescribed?
Review question 
Which approaches help people maintain taking prescribed medication(s), improve quality of life and reduce hospital admissions in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)? 
Background 
COPD is a lung condition that can cause long‐term breathing problems and includes symptoms such as shortness of breath. Medications do exist that can help but sometimes people do not take them as prescribed. Different approaches could help people to take their medication as prescribed and help improve symptoms or quality of life and reduce hospital admissions. 
We wanted to find out if any approaches could help people with COPD take their medication(s) as prescribed. 
Studies identified and selected 
We searched databases to find the studies. Four people working in pairs looked at the lists of studies separately and agreed on which ones were included. The latest search for studies was conducted in May 2020. 
Study characteristics 
We included studies comparing simple ways to help improve medication use (e.g. different medication doses or single inhalers instead of two separate inhalers) to usual COPD care. We also included studies that tested combination approaches (e.g. information or training from nurses or pharmacists and monitoring medication use). 
What were the key results? 
We included 14 studies (2191 people) in our analysis. No studies were masked (people knew whether they were receiving an approach to help them with adherence or the alternative). Six studies used simple approaches (e.g. change to medication dosage, change to type of inhaler, or a Bluetooth inhaler reminder device), and eight studies used combined approaches (e.g. nurses or pharmacists giving advice or information about how to improve medication use). 
We were uncertain about the effects of a different medication dose on people adhering to medication because it was no different to usual care (one study). Two separate studies found that a Bluetooth inhaler reminder device or a change in oral medication dose did not help to improve adherence. Health professionals involved in giving information may help to improve adherence (one study). This was measured by prescription refills. Motivating people to change their behaviour could help to improve adherence their medication (one study). This was measured by people completing a questionnaire about adherence to their medication. 
One study found that a Bluetooth inhaler device might help to improve quality of life. There may be little to no difference between those using single inhalers in the number of people admitted to hospital compared to those using two separate inhalers (one study). We found no difference between single approaches and usual care on the number of people who had side effects. 
Combined approaches may help to improve the number of people taking their medication, but we were not confident of this finding (four studies). They may have little to no impact on quality of life (three studies). Combined approaches could be beneficial in reducing the number of people with COPD admitted to hospital for any reason or because of COPD symptoms (two studies). 
There was no difference between combined approaches and in the number of people who had adverse events. 
Take home message 
We could not say for certain that simple approaches are useful to help people with COPD to improve medication use because of very limited information. Combined approaches may help people to take their medication(s) as prescribed and can help to reduce the number of people admitted to hospital, however, more information is needed to help answer this question with confidence.

Ways to Help People with COPD Take Their Medicines as Directed

## Rationale

**What is COPD and why does it matter?**

COPD stands for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is a lung condition that makes it hard to breathe. People with COPD may feel short of breath. This can make daily life difficult.

**What medicines can do**

Medicines exist that can help people with COPD breathe better. But sometimes people do not take their medicines as their doctor tells them to. This means the medicines cannot work as well as they should.

**Why this study was needed**

Researchers wanted to find ways to help people with COPD take their medicines correctly. They thought different approaches might help. These approaches could improve how people feel and keep them out of the hospital.

**What the researchers wanted to learn**

The researchers wanted to know if certain approaches could help people with COPD take their medicines as prescribed. They also wanted to see if these approaches improved quality of life. Quality of life means how well people feel in their daily lives. The researchers also looked at whether these approaches reduced hospital visits.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. The researchers looked at other studies that had already been done. They searched databases to find these studies. Four people worked in pairs to pick which studies to include. They did their latest search in May 2020.

**What did the studies look at?**

The researchers included 14 studies. These studies had 2,191 people in total. The studies tested two types of approaches:

Simple approaches included things like changing how often people take medicine. They also included using one inhaler instead of two. Some studies used a Bluetooth device that reminds people to use their inhaler.

Combined approaches used more than one method. These included nurses or pharmacists giving advice. They also included teaching people about their medicines. Some approaches tracked whether people took their medicines.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included people with COPD. The summary does not give specific ages or gender details.

**How long did the studies last?**

The summary does not give specific information about how long people were in each study.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The results were mixed. Here is what the researchers learned:

**Simple approaches:**

Changing medicine doses did not clearly help people take their medicines better. A Bluetooth reminder device did not help in two studies. Changing oral medicine doses also did not help.

One study found that health professionals giving information may help. This was measured by how often people refilled their prescriptions.

One study found that motivating people to change their behavior could help. People answered questions about taking their medicines.

One study found a Bluetooth inhaler device might improve quality of life. Using one inhaler instead of two did not change hospital visits. Simple approaches did not cause more side effects than usual care.

**Combined approaches:**

Combined approaches may help more people take their medicines. But the researchers were not fully confident about this finding. Four studies showed this result.

Combined approaches may not improve quality of life much. Three studies looked at this.

Combined approaches could reduce hospital visits. This included visits for any reason and visits for COPD symptoms. Two studies showed this.

Combined approaches did not cause more side effects than usual care.

**Main conclusions:**

The researchers could not say for certain that simple approaches help. There was not enough information.

Combined approaches may help people take their medicines as directed. They may also reduce hospital visits. But more studies are needed to be sure.

**Why this matters:**

This research helps doctors and nurses know what might work. It shows that getting help from health professionals may be useful. More research will help find the best ways to help people with COPD."
10.1002-14651858.CD013384.pub2-pls.txt,"Approaches to help people with COPD who have one or more long‐term conditions
What is COPD and comorbidity? 
COPD is a common condition caused mainly by smoking and can lead to long‐term breathing problems. Symptoms include shortness of breath, and cough with sputum production due to airways and lung damage. People with COPD may have one or more other long‐term conditions (comorbidities) such as heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, asthma and lung cancer which can lead to poor health. People living with two or more comorbidities can also be known as living with multimorbidity. 
Why did we do this review?  
Because many people with COPD live with multimorbidity, naturally people in clinical trials will have multimorbidities. However, the results of those trials are usually not reported broken down by multimorbidity. People with comorbidities may need to adapt interventions to take account of their comorbidity — for example taking exercise in water instead of on land so that their bodies are better supported. Historically, Cochrane Airways Reviews have not taken into account people's comorbidities, and this review is a first step to addressing this. We decided to complete a review that centres on people with COPD and comorbidities following a meeting with our COPD patient group, who highlighted concerns over comorbidities. After some deliberation, we decided to include the following two sorts of trials. 
1. Any single intervention for COPD delivered to people with COPD adapted to or targeting their comorbidity compared to routine care or any other intervention. 
2. Any intervention aimed at changing the management of people with COPD and comorbidities, which could be simple (e.g. scheduling COPD and heart clinics on the same day) or more complex (e.g. developing a new care package for management of people with COPD across a local health service), compared to routine care. 
We wanted to know which treatments improve quality of life and reduce exacerbations for people living with COPD and one or more comorbidities. 
We also wanted to find out about how people with COPD, carers and health professionals felt about those treatments. 
What information did we find? 
We carried out a search for studies in January 2021. We found seven  eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including 1197 people, and one qualitative study which was part of one of the randomised trials and provided information about people's opinions and experiences of using telehealth equipment. People included in the trials were aged between 64 and 72 years, and their COPD severity ranged from mild to very severe. The trials either included people with COPD and a specific comorbidity such as cardiovascular disease or lung cancer, or they included people with COPD and one or more other conditions of any sort. 
Results and conclusions 
There is not enough evidence on people with COPD and other comorbidities to draw firm conclusions about interventions aimed at COPD that are adapted for the comorbidity. The available evidence indicated the following:  
‐ Quality of life as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score may improve with tailored pulmonary rehabilitation compared to usual care (note that there is a strong evidence base for pulmonary rehabilitation in people with COPD). 
‐ Pulmonary rehabilitation is likely to improve quality of life as measured by the COPD assessment test (CAT) scores compared with usual care at 52 weeks and with a multicomponent telehealth intervention.  
‐ Evidence is uncertain about the effects of pharmacotherapy optimisation or telemonitoring interventions on CAT improvement compared with usual care. 
‐ There may be little to no difference in the number of people experiencing exacerbations, or mean exacerbations with case management compared with usual care.  
‐ For secondary outcomes, the distance walked by participants in six minutes may improve with pulmonary rehabilitation, water‐based exercise or multicomponent interventions. A multicomponent intervention may result in fewer people being admitted to hospital, although there may be little to no difference in a telemonitoring intervention.  
‐ There may be little to no difference between intervention and usual care for deaths across several studies. 
‐ One study compared water‐based exercise with land‐based exercise. We found no evidence for quality of life or exacerbations. There may be little to no difference between water‐ and land‐based exercise on the distance walked by participants in six minutes. 
‐ One qualitative study explored perceptions and experiences of people with COPD and long‐term conditions, and of researchers and health professionals who were involved in an RCT of telemonitoring equipment. Several themes were identified, including health status, beliefs and concerns, reliability of equipment, self‐efficacy, perceived ease of use, factors affecting usefulness and perceived usefulness, attitudes and intention, self‐management and changes in healthcare use.  
Larger studies with more people with COPD and comorbidities could help to find out if targeted approaches can improve health. 
Certainty of the information 
Overall there were very few studies and most studies were small. This means the results are based on a small amount of information. Trials with different interventions and different or more people may give a different result. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Helping People with COPD Who Have Other Long-Term Health Problems

## Plain Title

Testing treatments for people with COPD who also have other long-term health problems.

## Rationale

**What is COPD?**

COPD is a lung disease. It is mostly caused by smoking. People with COPD have trouble breathing. They feel short of breath. They cough and bring up mucus. This happens because their airways and lungs are damaged.

**What are other long-term health problems?**

Many people with COPD also have other health problems. These are called comorbidities. Common ones include heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, and lung cancer. Having COPD plus other health problems makes life harder. People feel worse. They need more care.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Researchers wanted to help people with COPD who have other health problems. Most studies only look at COPD alone. They do not look at people with multiple health problems. But many people with COPD have other conditions too.

A group of COPD patients told researchers this was important. They said having other health problems was a big concern. So researchers decided to study this.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to find treatments that work better for people with COPD and other health problems. They thought changing treatments to fit each person's needs might help. For example, some people might exercise in water instead of on land. The water supports their body better.

Researchers looked for two types of treatments:
- COPD treatments changed to fit a person's other health problems
- New ways to manage care for people with multiple health problems

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

Researchers looked for studies already done by other scientists. They searched in January 2021. They found 7 studies with 1,197 people. They also found 1 study about what people thought of the treatments.

**Who was in these studies?**

People in the studies were 64 to 72 years old. They all had COPD. Their COPD ranged from mild to very severe. They also had other health problems. Some had heart disease or lung cancer. Others had different conditions.

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies lasted different amounts of time. Some lasted several weeks. Others lasted up to one year.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

Researchers found only a small amount of information. The studies were small. This makes it hard to know for sure what works best.

**What might help people with COPD and other health problems?**

- **Exercise programs for the lungs** (called pulmonary rehabilitation) may help people feel better. Quality of life may improve.
- **Water-based exercise** may help people walk farther. This might be better for some people than land-based exercise.
- **Care management programs** may not reduce flare-ups of COPD. Flare-ups are times when breathing gets much worse.
- **Home monitoring with technology** (called telehealth) had mixed results. One study asked people what they thought. People had different opinions. Some liked the equipment. Others had concerns. Things that mattered included how easy it was to use and whether it helped them manage their health.
- **Hospital visits** may go down with some combined treatment programs.
- **Deaths** were about the same with new treatments compared to usual care.

**What do these results mean?**

There is not enough information yet. Researchers cannot say for sure which treatments work best. The studies were too small. More research is needed.

**What did researchers conclude?**

Larger studies are needed. These studies should include more people with COPD and other health problems. This would help find out if special treatments really help. Right now, pulmonary rehabilitation looks promising. But more proof is needed.

**Why is this important?**

Many people live with COPD and other health problems. They need treatments that work for all their conditions. This review is a first step. It shows what we know so far. It also shows we need more research. Future studies should focus on people with multiple health problems. This will help doctors give better care."
10.1002-14651858.CD013385.pub2-pls.txt,"Decision coaching for people making healthcare decisions
Background 
There is a need to better involve people who are making healthcare decisions about treatments (e.g. surgery) or screening (e.g. tests to tell if there is a health problem). Quality decisions are made when people know the best available evidence on options and can share what matters with their healthcare provider(s). 
Decision coaching supports people to prepare for making a health decision. It is provided by healthcare providers who are trained or use a protocol for decision coaching (e.g. nurses, doctors, pharmacists, social workers, health support workers such as peer health workers).  
We wanted to find out if decision coaching helps people to prepare for making healthcare decisions. 
 
What did we do? 
We are a team of patient partners, healthcare providers, teachers and researchers from seven countries. 
We looked for studies that tested decision coaching with people (adults and children) to prepare them for making a healthcare decision about treatment or screening for themselves or a family member. 
We included studies if people who received decision coaching were randomly put into study groups (e.g. using a computer to decide who goes in which group). Studies where people are randomly put into groups are the best way to compare findings between groups and give results we can rely on when we look at the effects of an intervention like decision coaching.  
 
Search strategy  
To find studies, we searched eight online data banks. We asked experts and authors of studies about decision coaching. We included studies published up to June 2021.  
 
What we found  
We found 28 studies about decision coaching used alone or with high‐quality patient information based on research (called ‘evidence‐based information’). There was a total of 5509 adults in the 28 studies. None of the studies included children, and only one study included people (parents) making decisions for someone else. The studies tested decision coaching with a range of healthcare decisions such as treatment decisions related to cancer, menopause, or mental illness; cancer screening decisions, and genetic testing.  
Some of the studies looked at decision coaching with, or compared to, disease‐specific information or evidence‐based information such as patient decision aids (booklets, videos, online tools that: make the decision clear, provide options and the pros and cons, and help people be clear on what matters to them). 
 
What does the evidence show? 
People who received decision coaching compared with evidence‐based information only: 
‐ may have little or no change in knowledge (406 patients, 3 studies);
‐ may have little of no change in anxiety (242 patients, 1 study).
 
People who received decision coaching plus evidence‐based information compared with usual care:  
‐may have improved knowledge (1073 patients, 5 studies)
 
Our confidence in the results 
We have low confidence that decision coaching plus evidence‐based information improves people’s knowledge compared to usual care. We have low confidence that decision coaching may have little or no effect on knowledge and anxiety compared to evidence‐based information. We are less confident about our other findings, as the certainty of the evidence is very low and there were important outcomes that were not reported by the included studies. Many studies had a small number of people taking part and this means that the results of this review might change with more studies.   
 
What this means 
Decision coaching may improve peoples’ knowledge to help them prepare to make healthcare decisions when used with evidence‐based information. The review did not detect any adverse effects with the use of decision coaching.  
","# Plain Language Summary: Decision Coaching for People Making Healthcare Decisions

## Plain Title
Does coaching help people make better choices about their health care?

## Rationale

**What is the health issue?**

People often need to make hard choices about their health care. These choices might be about treatments like surgery. Or they might be about screening tests to check for health problems.

**Why is this important?**

Making good health choices is hard. People need to know the facts about their options. They also need to share what matters most to them with their doctor or nurse. When people don't have enough help, they may feel confused or worried. They may not make the best choice for themselves.

**What is decision coaching?**

Decision coaching is help given by trained health workers. These workers can be nurses, doctors, or other health helpers. They use special training or a guide to help people get ready to make health choices.

**Why did we do this study?**

We wanted to find out if decision coaching helps people prepare to make health care choices. We wanted to know if it helps people learn more about their options. We also wanted to know if it helps people feel less worried.

## Trial Design

**How did we do this study?**

Our team included patients, health workers, teachers, and researchers from seven countries. We looked for studies that tested decision coaching.

**Who was in the studies?**

We found 28 studies with 5,509 adults in total. No studies included children. Only one study included parents making choices for their child. The studies looked at many types of health choices. These included choices about cancer treatment, menopause treatment, and mental health care. They also included choices about cancer screening tests and genetic tests.

**How were the studies set up?**

In these studies, people were put into groups by chance. A computer decided which group each person joined. This is the best way to compare results between groups. Some people got decision coaching. Some got written information only. Some got usual care from their doctor.

**What did we compare?**

Some studies compared decision coaching to written information based on research. This information included booklets, videos, or online tools. These tools explain the choice clearly. They list the options and the good and bad points of each. They help people think about what matters most to them.

## Results

**What did we find?**

We compared decision coaching to information only. We found that decision coaching may cause little or no change in how much people knew. This finding came from 3 studies with 406 people. Decision coaching may also cause little or no change in how worried people felt. This finding came from 1 study with 242 people.

We also compared decision coaching plus information to usual care. We found that this combination may help people learn more. This finding came from 5 studies with 1,073 people.

**How sure are we of these results?**

We are not very sure about our findings. Many studies had only a small number of people. The studies did not all measure the same things. Some important results were not reported. Our findings might change when more studies are done.

**What does this mean?**

Decision coaching may help people learn more when used with good written information. This may help them get ready to make health care choices. We did not find any harmful effects from decision coaching.

**What is still needed?**

We need more studies with more people. We need studies that look at children. We need studies that look at people making choices for family members. We need studies that measure more outcomes that matter to patients."

Why is this question important?Infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS) is an eye disorder that causes involuntary movement of the eyes from side to side, up and down, or in circles. INS typically develops shortly after birth, and persists throughout life. It is often associated with visual problems, such as:‐ long‐sightedness (when people can see distant objects clearly, but near objects appear blurred);‐ or short‐sightedness (when people can see near objects clearly, but distant objects appear blurred). 
There is currently no cure for INS. However, it is possible to reduce eye movement and improve people’s vision. One of the main options is eye surgery, which involves operating on the muscles that control eye movement. Several different surgical procedures can be used: some procedures involve detaching and reattaching the eye muscles, whereas others require complete removal of these muscles.   
It is unclear whether some surgical procedures for INS have more benefits or risks than others. To find out which surgical procedures work best, we reviewed the evidence from research studies. We were particularly interested in whether different surgical procedures could improve vision and quality of life in people with INS. We also wanted to know about any adverse (unwanted) effects. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?First, we searched for randomised controlled studies, in which people were randomly divided into two or more treatment groups. This makes it less likely that any differences between treatment effects were actually due to differences in the people who received them (rather than due to the treatments themselves, which is what we wanted to find out). 
We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. 
What did we find?We found one study, set in India, that involved a total of 10 people with INS who were followed for six months after surgery. The study authors did not report any information about: ‐ the age and gender of the people who took part in it;‐ or the source of funding for the study. 
The study compared two different surgical procedures: ‐ one procedure in which two horizontal rectus muscles (eye muscles that control side‐to‐side eye movements) were moved from their original position to a position further back on the eyeball; and‐ another procedure in which four horizontal rectus muscles were detached and reattached, in their original position.The procedures were conducted in both eyes. 
The study compared the effects of the treatments on:‐ clarity of vision six months after surgery;‐ intensity of eye movement six months after surgery;‐ adverse events six months after surgery; and‐ quality of life.   
The study did not investigate the effects of treatments on:‐ head posture;‐ the amount of time when the eye is still; or‐ the time it takes to recognise objects. 
We have very little confidence in the evidence from the study we found, because:‐ it is based on a very small number of people; and‐ the patients and researchers in the study knew which type of surgery each patient received. This knowledge may have influenced the study results. 
We therefore cannot determine whether the two procedures investigated in the study had different benefits and risks. 
What does this mean?There is insufficient evidence to determine whether some surgical procedures are better than others for INS. We need researchers to conduct robust randomised controlled trials in future, so that we can compare different procedures. This would help clinicians, and people with INS, to make treatment decisions based on evidence from research. 
How‐up‐to date is this review?The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to July 2020. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Surgery for Involuntary Eye Movements in Babies and Children

## Plain Title

Comparing Different Eye Surgeries for Children Born with Constant Eye Movement

## Rationale

### What is the condition?

Some babies are born with an eye problem called infantile nystagmus syndrome, or INS. Their eyes move on their own without control. The eyes may move side to side, up and down, or in circles. This starts soon after birth and lasts for life.

### What problems does it cause?

Children with INS often have trouble seeing clearly. Some cannot see things up close. Others cannot see things far away. These vision problems make daily life harder.

### Why was this study needed?

Doctors cannot cure INS. But they can help reduce the eye movement. One way to help is through surgery. Doctors operate on the muscles that move the eyes. There are different ways to do this surgery. Some doctors detach the eye muscles and put them back. Other doctors remove the muscles completely.

No one knows which type of surgery works best. Researchers wanted to find out which surgery helps people see better. They also wanted to know if some surgeries cause more problems than others. This information would help doctors and families choose the best treatment.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?

Researchers looked for studies that tested different eye surgeries for INS. They found one study from India. The study included 10 people with INS. Doctors followed these people for 6 months after surgery.

### Who was in the study?

The study included 10 people with INS. The researchers did not tell us how old these people were. They did not tell us if they were male or female.

### What did the study compare?

The study compared two types of surgery. Both surgeries were done on both eyes.

In the first surgery, doctors moved two eye muscles. These muscles control side to side movement. Doctors moved them to a new spot further back on the eyeball.

In the second surgery, doctors worked on four eye muscles. They took the muscles off and put them back in the same place.

### How long did the study last?

People in the study were watched for 6 months after their surgery.

## Results

### What did the study measure?

The study looked at several things 6 months after surgery:
- How clearly people could see
- How much the eyes moved
- Any problems caused by the surgery
- Quality of life

The study did not look at head position. It did not measure how long the eye stayed still. It did not check how fast people could recognize objects.

### What were the main results?

We cannot say which surgery worked better. The evidence from this study is very weak. Here is why:

The study only included 10 people. This is too small to give us good answers.

The patients knew which surgery they got. The doctors also knew. This knowledge can change how people act and what they report. It can make the results less trustworthy.

### What does this mean?

We do not have enough good information to say which eye surgery is best for INS. We need more research studies. These studies should include more people. The studies should be done in a way that gives us better answers.

Better research would help doctors know which surgery to recommend. It would help families make good choices about treatment.

### How current is this information?

Researchers looked for studies up to July 2020."
10.1002-14651858.CD013393.pub2-pls.txt,"After using shock waves to break up kidney stones, do medicines called alpha‑blockers help to get rid of the stone fragments? 
What are kidney stones? 
Waste products in the blood can sometimes form crystals that collect inside the kidneys. These can build up over time to form a hard stone‐like lump, called a kidney stone. 
Kidney stones can develop in both kidneys especially in people with certain medical conditions or who are taking certain medicines, or if people do not drink enough water or fluids. Stones can cause severe pain, fever and a kidney infection if they block the ureter. 
Treatments for kidney stones 
Most stones are small enough to pass out in the urine: drinking plenty of water and other fluids will help. Larger kidney stones may be too big to pass out naturally and are usually removed by surgery. 
Shock wave lithotripsy is a non‐surgical way to treat stones in the kidney or ureter. High energy sound waves are applied to the outside of the body to break kidney stones into smaller pieces. After shock wave treatment, medicines called alpha‐blockers are sometimes given to help the stone fragments pass out naturally. 
Alpha‐blockers work by relaxing muscles and helping to keep blood vessels open. They are usually used to treat high blood pressure and problems with storing and passing urine in men who have an enlarged prostate gland. Alpha‐blockers may relax the muscle in the ureters, which might help to get rid of kidney stones and fragments.              
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out how well alpha‐blockers work to help kidney stone fragments pass out in the urine. We also wanted to find out about potential unwanted effects that might be associated with alpha‐blockers. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at giving alpha‐blockers to adults, after shock wave treatment, to clear kidney stone fragments. 
We looked for randomized controlled studies, in which the treatments that people received were decided at random, because these studies usually give the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. 
Search date: we included evidence published up to 27 February 2020. 
What we found 
We found 40 studies including 4793 people who had shock wave treatment to break up their kidney stones. Most of the studies were done in Asia; some were in Europe, Africa and South America. Most studies did not report their sources of funding. 
The studies compared giving an alpha‐blocker with giving a placebo (dummy) treatment or usual care (could include antibiotics, painkillers and fluids given by mouth or through a drip). 
Tamsulosin was the most commonly studied alpha‐blocker; the others were silodosin, doxazosin, terazosin and alfuzosin. 
What are the results of our review? 
Compared with usual care or a placebo treatment, alpha‐blockers may:
clear kidney stones in more people: in 111 more people for every 1000 people treated (36 studies); 
clear stones faster: by nearly four days (14 studies);
reduce the need for extra treatments to clear stones: in 32 fewer people for every 1000 people treated (12 studies); and 
cause fewer unwanted effects: affecting 103 fewer people for every 1000 people treated (seven studies). 
Most unwanted effects were emergency visits to hospitals, and people going back into hospital for stone related problems. Unwanted effects were more common in people who had usual care or a placebo treatment than in people given alpha‐blockers. 
None of the studies looked at people's quality of life (well‐being).
How reliable are these results? 
We are uncertain about these results because they were based on studies in which it was unclear how people were chosen to take part; it was unclear if results were reported fully; some results were inconsistent and in some studies the results varied widely.  Our results are likely to change if further evidence becomes available. 
Conclusions 
Giving an alpha‐blocker after shock wave treatment to break up kidney stones might clear the fragments faster, in more people and reduce the need for extra treatments. Alpha‑blockers might cause fewer unwanted effects than usual care or a placebo. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Alpha-Blocker Medicines After Kidney Stone Treatment

## Plain Title

Do Alpha-Blocker Medicines Help Clear Kidney Stone Pieces After Sound Wave Treatment?

## Rationale

**What are kidney stones?**

Your kidneys clean your blood. Sometimes waste in the blood forms crystals. These crystals can build up and form hard lumps called kidney stones.

Kidney stones can cause severe pain. They can also cause fever and infections. This happens when stones block the tube that carries urine from your kidney to your bladder. This tube is called the ureter.

**How are kidney stones treated?**

Small stones usually pass out when you urinate. Drinking lots of water helps. Large stones are too big to pass on their own. Doctors use different treatments to remove them.

One treatment uses sound waves from outside your body. These waves break large stones into smaller pieces. This treatment is called shock wave lithotripsy. It does not require surgery.

**What are alpha-blockers?**

After sound wave treatment, doctors sometimes give medicines called alpha-blockers. These medicines relax muscles in your body. They help keep blood vessels open. Doctors usually use them to treat high blood pressure. They also help men who have trouble urinating.

Alpha-blockers may relax muscles in the ureters. This might help stone pieces pass out more easily.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if alpha-blockers really help. They wanted to know if these medicines help stone pieces pass out faster. They also wanted to know about side effects.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 40 different studies. These studies included 4,793 adults. All had received sound wave treatment for kidney stones.

Most studies took place in Asia. Some were in Europe, Africa, and South America.

The studies compared two groups:
- One group received alpha-blocker medicines
- One group received fake medicine or usual care

Usual care included pain medicine, antibiotics, and fluids. Fluids were given by mouth or through a tube in the arm.

The studies tested different alpha-blockers. The most common was tamsulosin. Others were silodosin, doxazosin, terazosin, and alfuzosin.

Researchers used random selection. This means people were put into groups by chance. This makes the results more reliable.

The studies were published up to February 2020.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

Alpha-blockers may help in several ways:

**More people cleared their stones:**
Out of every 1,000 people treated, 111 more people cleared their stones. This was compared to people who got usual care or fake medicine.

**Stones cleared faster:**
People taking alpha-blockers cleared stones about 4 days faster.

**Fewer people needed extra treatments:**
Out of every 1,000 people, 32 fewer people needed more treatments to clear stones.

**Fewer side effects:**
Out of every 1,000 people, 103 fewer people had side effects. Most side effects were emergency hospital visits. Some people had to go back to the hospital for stone problems. People who took alpha-blockers had fewer of these problems.

**What was not studied:**
None of the studies looked at quality of life. This means how well people felt overall.

**How reliable are these results?**

The researchers are somewhat uncertain about these results. Some studies did not clearly explain how they chose people. Some results were inconsistent. Results varied widely in some studies. More research may change these findings.

**What do these results mean?**

Alpha-blockers might help clear kidney stone pieces after sound wave treatment. They might work faster and help more people. They might reduce the need for more treatments. They might also cause fewer side effects than usual care or fake medicine.

However, more high-quality studies are needed. These would make the results more certain.

10.1002-14651858.CD013397.pub2-pls.txt,"Compression bandages or stockings versus no compression for treating venous leg ulcers
Key messages 
Compared with not using compression, compression therapy that uses bandages or stockings to treat venous leg ulcers: 
‐ probably heals venous leg ulcers more quickly;
‐ probably increases the number of people whose ulcer has completely healed after 12 months; 
‐ probably reduces pain; and
‐ may improve some aspects of people’s quality of life.
However, there is still uncertainty about whether or not compression therapy causes unwanted side effects, and if the health benefits of using compression outweigh its cost. 
What are leg ulcers? 
Leg ulcers are open skin wounds on the lower leg that can last weeks, months or even years. Most leg ulcers are caused by venous diseases that affect the circulation of blood in leg veins. Venous leg ulcers can cause distress and pain to patients, and can be very costly to the health service. 
What did we want to find out? 
Standard treatment options for venous leg ulcers often include compression therapy. This involves applying external pressure around the lower leg to help the return of blood from the legs to the heart. Compression therapy uses bandages, stockings or other devices. 
We wanted to find out if compression therapy delivered by bandages and stockings compared with no compression: 
‐ heals venous leg ulcers;
‐ has any unwanted effects;
‐ improves people’s quality of life;
‐ has health benefits that outweigh the costs (cost‐effectiveness); and
‐ reduces pain.
What did we do? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where the treatment or care people receive is chosen at random). This type of study design provides the most reliable health evidence about the effects of a treatment. We searched for studies that evaluated the effects of any types of compression bandages or stockings compared with no compression in people affected with venous leg ulcers in any care setting. We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found 14 studies (1391 people, average age: 70.1 years) that lasted on average for 12 weeks. People in eight of the 14 studies were treated in outpatient and community settings. People had venous leg ulcers that had lasted for 22 months on average, and most ulcers had an area between 5 and 20 cm2. 
The studies used three types of compression therapy: short‐stretch bandage, four‐layer compression bandage, and Unna's boot (a type of compression bandage containing zinc oxide). These therapies were compared with no compression in forms of 'usual care', pharmacological treatment, a variety of dressings, and a variety of treatments where only some participants received compression (but it was not the norm). 
(1) Venous leg‐ulcer healing and unwanted effects  
Compared with no compression, the evidence suggests that:
‐ people wearing compression bandages or stockings probably experience complete ulcer healing more quickly; and 
‐ more people treated using the compression bandages or stockings are likely to experience complete ulcer healing within 12 months. 
However, we did not find clear evidence to tell if using compression bandages or stockings causes any unwanted effects. 
(2) Other effects  
The evidence suggests that, compared with not using compression, the use of compression bandages or stockings: 
‐ probably reduces pain more than not using compression; and
‐ may improve some aspects of people’s quality of life in 12 weeks to 12 months.
However, we are uncertain if the use of compression bandages or stockings results in health benefits that outweigh their costs. 
What limited our confidence in the evidence? 
Most studies were small (51 people on average) and 10 of the 14 included studies used methods that could introduce errors in their results. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to June 2020.
","# Plain Language Summary: Compression Therapy for Leg Ulcers

## Plain Title

Does Using Compression Bandages or Stockings Help Heal Leg Ulcers Better Than Not Using Them?

## Rationale

**What are leg ulcers and why are they a problem?**

Leg ulcers are open wounds on the lower leg. They do not heal quickly. Some last for weeks, months, or even years. Most leg ulcers happen because of vein problems. The veins in the legs do not work well. Blood does not flow back to the heart as it should.

These ulcers cause many problems for patients. They can be very painful. They can make daily life hard. They also cost a lot of money to treat.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors often treat leg ulcers with compression therapy. This means wrapping the leg with bandages or using special stockings. The wrapping puts pressure on the leg. This pressure helps blood flow back up to the heart.

Researchers wanted to know if compression therapy really works. They wanted to compare it to not using compression at all. They needed to find out if the benefits are worth it.

**What did researchers think would happen?**

Researchers thought compression therapy would help ulcers heal faster. They thought it might reduce pain. They also thought it might help patients feel better overall.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 14 different studies. These studies tested compression therapy in real patients. The studies were randomized controlled trials. This means patients were put into groups by chance. Some got compression therapy. Others did not.

**Who was in these studies?**

A total of 1,391 people took part. The average age was about 70 years. All patients had leg ulcers caused by vein problems. Their ulcers had lasted about 22 months on average. Most ulcers were between 5 and 20 square centimeters in size.

**Where did the studies take place?**

Eight of the 14 studies treated patients in clinics or at home. Patients did not need to stay in the hospital.

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies lasted about 12 weeks on average. Some studies followed patients for up to 12 months.

**What treatments were tested?**

Three types of compression were used:
- Short-stretch bandages
- Four-layer bandages
- Unna's boot (a special bandage with zinc oxide)

These were compared to no compression. Patients without compression got other treatments instead. These included regular wound care, medicines, or different types of dressings.

## Results

**What did the study find about healing?**

Compression therapy probably helps ulcers heal faster. More people who used compression bandages or stockings had their ulcers completely heal within 12 months. This is compared to people who did not use compression.

**Were there any unwanted side effects?**

The studies did not find clear proof about side effects. Researchers are not sure if compression causes problems or not. More research is needed to answer this question.

**Did compression help with pain?**

Yes. Compression therapy probably reduces pain more than not using compression. Patients who wore bandages or stockings felt less pain.

**Did it improve quality of life?**

Compression may improve some parts of life for patients. This includes how they feel and what they can do. The improvement was seen over 12 weeks to 12 months. However, not all parts of quality of life got better.

**Is compression worth the cost?**

Researchers are not sure about this yet. They do not know if the health benefits are worth more than what compression costs. More studies are needed to answer this question.

**What are the main conclusions?**

Compression therapy using bandages or stockings probably works better than no compression. It helps ulcers heal faster. It helps more ulcers heal completely. It also reduces pain. It may make some parts of life better for patients.

However, there are still questions. We need to know more about side effects. We need to know if compression is worth the cost.

**Why should we be careful about these results?**

Most studies were small. They had about 51 people each. Ten of the 14 studies had problems with how they were done. These problems could affect the results. This means we cannot be completely certain about all the findings.

The evidence in this review is current through June 2020."
10.1002-14651858.CD013398.pub3-pls.txt,"House modifications for preventing malaria
What is the aim of this review? 
House modifications, such as screening (covering potential house entry points for mosquitoes with netting or mesh), or the use of alternative construction materials, may contribute to reducing the burden of malaria. They work by blocking mosquitoes from entering houses, and reducing the number of bites householders receive indoors. Some of the house modifications under consideration additionally aim to kill any mosquitoes that attempt to enter houses by incorporating insecticide into the modification. 
Key messages 
Screening windows, doors, eaves and ceilings to prevent mosquitoes entering the house may reduce malaria transmission and illness in people living in the house, based on evidence from two studies conducted in Africa. Four trials awaiting publication are likely to enrich the current evidence base. 
What was studied in the review? 
This review summarized studies investigating the effects of house modifications on human malaria outcomes. If studies additionally reported the effect of the house modifications on mosquitoes (those with potential to carry malaria), or householders' views, we also summarized this data. After searching for relevant studies, we identified six studies conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa, two of which have published data, and four of which are not yet in the public domain. All trials assessed screening (of windows, doors, eaves, ceilings, or any combination of these), either alone or in combination with eave closure, roof modification, or eave tube installation (a ""lure and kill"" device positioned in eave gaps). 
What are the main results of the review? 
The two trials with published data assessed the effect of screening alone on malaria infection. Both trials showed a reduction in malaria in screened houses, to varying degrees of effect. One trial in Ethiopia showed that people living in screened houses were around 62% less likely to experience an episode of clinical malaria (caused by P falciparum). However, the certainty of this evidence was low due to issues with the study design, and the trial did not study enough people for us to be confident about the results. Another trial in The Gambia showed that people living in screened houses were around 16% less likely to have P falciparum malaria parasites in their blood, and were less likely to experience anaemia. Our confidence in this result was low because the trial did not study enough people.

","# Plain Language Summary: House Changes to Stop Malaria

## Plain Title
Can Changes to Houses Help Prevent Malaria?

## Rationale

### What is malaria and why is it a problem?
Malaria is a disease spread by mosquito bites. When a mosquito carrying malaria bites a person, that person can get sick. Malaria causes fever and can make people very ill. It is a big problem in many parts of the world, especially in Africa.

### Why did researchers do this study?
Many people get malaria inside their homes at night. Mosquitoes fly into houses through open spaces. Researchers wanted to know if changing houses could keep mosquitoes out. If fewer mosquitoes get inside, fewer people might get malaria.

### What changes to houses were tested?
The main change was adding screens. Screens are like nets or mesh that cover open spaces. They let air in but keep bugs out. Researchers put screens over windows, doors, and gaps in walls and roofs. Some changes also tried to kill mosquitoes that came near the house.

### Why might these changes work?
Screens block mosquitoes from flying into houses. If mosquitoes cannot get inside, they cannot bite people while they sleep. This could mean fewer people get malaria.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked at six studies from Africa. All six studies tested house screens. Two studies have shared their results so far. Four studies are still being finished.

### Who was in these studies?
The studies included people living in areas where malaria is common. The studies looked at both adults and children. All people lived in houses that were either changed or left the same.

### How long did the studies last?
The studies followed people for different amounts of time. This let researchers see if fewer people got malaria in houses with screens.

### What did researchers measure?
Researchers checked if people got sick with malaria. They also tested people's blood for malaria parasites. These are tiny germs that cause malaria.

## Results

### What did the studies find?
Two studies have shared results so far. Both found that screens helped reduce malaria.

**Study in Ethiopia:**
People in houses with screens were much less likely to get malaria. About 62 out of 100 fewer people got sick compared to houses without screens. However, this study was small. More research is needed to be sure of this result.

**Study in The Gambia:**
People in houses with screens were less likely to have malaria parasites in their blood. About 16 out of 100 fewer people had these parasites. People in screened houses also had less anemia. Anemia means not having enough healthy blood. This study was also small, so more research would help.

### What do these results mean?
Screens on houses may help protect people from malaria. Both studies showed that screens reduced malaria in some way. However, the studies were small. We need more research to know for sure how well screens work.

### Why is this important?
Malaria makes many people sick every year. Finding simple ways to prevent malaria is very important. Adding screens to houses might be one way to help. Screens could work along with other ways to fight malaria, like bed nets and medicine.

### What comes next?
Four more studies are being finished. When these studies share their results, we will know more. This will help us understand if house screens really work well to prevent malaria.

### Review date

10.1002-14651858.CD013399.pub2-pls.txt,"Prevention of blood clots in adults diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and treated with asparaginase‐based chemotherapy 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether currently available medications for prevention of blood clots have an appreciable balance between benefits and harms in adults with a subtype of blood cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) treated with asparaginase‐containing chemotherapy.  
Key messages 
We are uncertain whether blood‐derived products such as antithrombin concentrates for the prevention of blood clots in adults with ALL treated with asparaginase‐based chemotherapy are associated with unacceptable harms such as death. Our confidence in the identified studies is limited because of their non‐randomised design with few participants and no control for underlying factors that could influence the outcome. 
Harms regarding other types of blood clot prevention such as low‐molecular‐weight heparin could not be evaluated, because death and bleeding were not reported.  We did not look at benefits such as reduction in risk of blot clots, given the low quality of identified evidence (no randomised studies). We need high‐quality randomised studies, as the conduct of such studies minimises the risk of underlying factors influencing the outcomes.  
What was studied in this review?  
ALL is a subtype of blood cancer arising from malignant transformation of immature white blood cells of lymphoid origin. Over the last 20 years, the historically poor survival in adults with this disease has markedly improved, primarily due to the introduction of more intensive anti‐leukaemic treatment inspired by that used in children with ALL. One of the hallmarks of this treatment is the intensive use of the anti‐leukaemic agent called asparaginase. However, nothing comes without a price. Both older age and asparaginase treatment increase the risk of blood clots, which can either block the blood vessels (predominantly in those called veins) and change the normal blood flow or shower fractions of the clot into other veins located in important organs, resulting in serious health problems. Additionally, doctors are prone to stop asparaginase treatment, if blood clots occur—potentially compromising survival in these people.  
We do not know if the existing types of blood clot prevention protect against the clots and do not cause bleeding and death in adults with this disease. The medications include heparins, vitamin K antagonists, synthetic pentasaccharides, direct thrombin inhibitors, direct oral anticoagulants, or blood‐derived products for antithrombin substitution (decreased production in the body of this anti‐blood clotting protein during asparaginase), and mechanical prevention such as graduated elastic stockings.  
Therefore, we looked at all currently available research in adults with ALL treated with asparaginase‐containing chemotherapy who received blood clot prevention compared to placebo or no prevention. We looked at the following outcomes: first‐time symptomatic venous blood clot, all‐cause death, major bleeding, blood clot‐related death, asymptomatic venous blood clot, clinically relevant non‐major bleeding, heparin‐induced lowering of blood platelet counts, and quality of life. 
What are the results of this review? 
We found 23 studies, of which we included two studies in our main analyses to help answer the question and nine studies in an additional analysis to help describe the limitations of the evidence. The remaining 12 studies could not be included due to missing outcomes or critical risk of bias, as people in the control group were not 'real' controls.  
The two studies from our main analysis were conducted in UK/Canada and compared antithrombin with no antithrombin concentrates and low‐molecular‐weight heparin with no low‐molecular‐weight heparin, respectively, for people with ALL. We are uncertain whether antithrombin concentrates in adults with ALL treated with asparaginase‐based chemotherapy improve/reduce all‐cause/blood clot‐related death, because our confidence in the evidence was very low (one study, 40 adults). Harms in relation to the use of low‐molecular‐weight heparin could not be evaluated, because all‐cause/blood clot‐related death, major/clinically relevant non‐major bleeding, or heparin‐induced lowering of platelets were not reported. None of the studies looked at quality of life.  
No studies were found that evaluated any of the other prevention types. We did not look at benefits such as reduction in risk of blood clots, given the low certainty of evidence. 
How up to date is this review? 
The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to 02 June, 2020. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Preventing Blood Clots in Adults with Blood Cancer

## Plain Title

Can medicines prevent blood clots in adults with a type of blood cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukemia?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of blood cancer. It starts when young white blood cells grow out of control. These cells are part of the body's defense system.

**Why is this a problem for patients?**

Adults with ALL now live longer than before. Doctors use stronger treatments that work better. One key medicine in this treatment is called asparaginase. But this medicine has a serious side effect. It raises the risk of blood clots.

Blood clots can block blood vessels. They usually form in veins. These clots can break apart and travel to important organs like the lungs or brain. This causes serious health problems. Blood clots can even cause death.

When blood clots happen, doctors often stop the asparaginase treatment. This may reduce the chance of survival.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors do not know if medicines that prevent blood clots actually help adults with ALL. They also do not know if these medicines cause harm. Harm could include bleeding or death.

**What medicines might help?**

Several types of medicines might prevent blood clots:
- Heparins (blood thinners)
- Vitamin K blockers
- Direct oral blood thinners
- Antithrombin concentrates (blood products that replace a clotting protein)
- Compression stockings

This study looked at whether these medicines work and are safe.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers searched for all studies done by June 2, 2020. They looked for studies in adults with ALL. These adults received asparaginase treatment. They also received medicine to prevent blood clots.

The researchers compared these adults to others who got no prevention or a fake medicine (placebo).

**Who was in the studies?**

The main analysis included two studies:
- One study from the UK and Canada with 40 adults
- One study that looked at low-molecular-weight heparin

All participants had ALL. All received asparaginase treatment.

**What did researchers measure?**

They looked at:
- Death from any cause
- Death from blood clots
- Major bleeding
- Blood clots in veins
- Smaller bleeding problems
- Low platelet counts (platelets help blood clot)
- Quality of life

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The researchers found very limited information. They could not give clear answers.

**About antithrombin concentrates:**

One small study with 40 adults tested antithrombin concentrates. The researchers are very uncertain if this medicine helps or harms. The study was too small. It was not designed well enough to give reliable answers.

**About low-molecular-weight heparin:**

One study looked at this blood thinner. But it did not report deaths or bleeding. So researchers could not tell if it was safe.

**About other prevention medicines:**

No studies tested the other types of blood clot prevention medicines.

**About quality of life:**

No studies measured how patients felt or their quality of life.

**Why is the evidence uncertain?**

The studies had major problems:
- Very few participants
- Not designed as randomized trials (the best type of study)
- Did not control for other factors that affect outcomes
- Missing important information about safety

**What does this mean?**

We do not know if blood clot prevention medicines help adults with ALL who take asparaginase. We also do not know if these medicines cause serious harm like death or bleeding.

**What is needed?**

Better studies are needed. These should be randomized controlled trials. This means researchers randomly assign patients to get the medicine or not. This type of study gives the most reliable answers. It reduces the chance that other factors affect the results.

**Conclusion**

Right now, doctors do not have good evidence to guide their decisions. They cannot tell patients with confidence whether blood clot prevention medicines will help or harm them. More research is urgently needed to answer this important question."

Review question
This review aimed to gather evidence for the use of any physical activity intervention for people with congenital heart disease. We aimed to compare interventions including exercise training, physical activity promotion or lung training with no intervention (usual care). 
Background
Congenital heart disease is the term used for a range of birth defects that affect how the heart works. People with congenital heart disease have reduced life expectancy, physical fitness and quality of life. However, due to better prenatal diagnoses, surgical procedures (often performed in the early years of life) and earlier interventions, the survival rate for those born with this disease has improved dramatically, such that most people will now live into adulthood. Exercise training and physical activity interventions are known to improve fitness, physical activity, survival and quality of life in healthy people, but it is not clear how effective these programmes are for people with long‐term medical conditions. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies in September 2019 and identified 15 studies involving 924 participants. The studies used three main types of interventions, including programmes designed to increase physical activity, aerobic fitness and health‐related quality of life and compared physical activity intervention and control interventions in people with congenital heart disease.  
Key results
We included 15 trials with 924 participants. Half of the participants were female. Of the 15 trials, 5 used a total of 500 young people (less than 18 years of age) and 10 trials used a total of 424 adult participants. We found that physical fitness and physical activity may slightly increase but we are very uncertain about quality of life. There is currently no data to say if this small increase in fitness will result in fewer visits to the hospital. But there were no recorded deaths or serious events that were related to participation in physical activity. 
Quality of evidence
Using a validated scientific approach (GRADE), the certainty in the evidence base was moderate for fitness, low for physical activity and very low for quality of life. Most outcomes were limited due to small study participant numbers and poor reporting of study details. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Physical Activity Programs for People Born with Heart Problems

## Plain Title
Can exercise and physical activity programs help people who were born with heart problems?

## Rationale

**What is congenital heart disease?**
Some people are born with hearts that do not work the way they should. This is called congenital heart disease. The heart may have holes or other problems from birth.

**Why is this a problem?**
People with congenital heart disease often face challenges. They may not live as long as others. They may not be as fit. Their quality of life may be lower. Quality of life means how good people feel about their health and daily life.

**What has changed?**
Doctors can now find these heart problems before babies are born. Surgeries can fix many problems when children are very young. Because of this, most people born with heart problems now live to be adults.

**Why did researchers do this study?**
We know that exercise helps healthy people. It makes them fitter. It helps them live longer. It makes them feel better. But we do not know if exercise programs work the same way for people with long-term health problems. Researchers wanted to find out if physical activity programs help people with congenital heart disease.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
They wanted to see if exercise programs could help these people get fitter. They wanted to know if these programs could increase daily physical activity. They also wanted to see if quality of life would improve.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked for all studies about this topic. They searched through September 2019. They found 15 studies. These studies included 924 people total.

**Who was in these studies?**
Half of the people were female. Half were male. Some studies used young people under 18 years old. Five studies included 500 young people. Other studies used adults. Ten studies included 424 adults. All people in the studies had congenital heart disease.

**What did the studies compare?**
The studies compared two groups. One group did physical activity programs. The other group received usual care. Usual care means normal medical treatment without special exercise programs.

**What types of programs were tested?**
The programs had three main goals. Some programs aimed to increase physical activity. Some aimed to improve aerobic fitness. Aerobic fitness means how well your heart and lungs work during exercise. Some programs aimed to improve quality of life.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The studies showed some positive results. Physical fitness may increase a little bit. Physical activity may also increase a little bit. However, researchers are very uncertain about quality of life. The evidence was not clear enough.

**Were the programs safe?**
Yes, the programs appeared safe. No one died during the studies. No serious problems happened because of the exercise programs. This is good news for people worried about safety.

**What about hospital visits?**
Right now, we do not have enough information. We cannot say if these small fitness improvements lead to fewer hospital visits. More research is needed to answer this question.

**How good was the evidence?**
Researchers rated the quality of the evidence. They used a special system called GRADE. For fitness improvements, the evidence quality was moderate. For physical activity increases, the evidence quality was low. For quality of life, the evidence quality was very low.

**Why was the evidence quality limited?**
Most studies had small numbers of people. Many studies did not report all their details clearly. This made it harder to be certain about the results.

**What do these results mean?**
Physical activity programs may help people with congenital heart disease get a bit fitter. They appear to be safe. But we need more and better studies. These studies should include more people. They should report their methods more clearly. This will help us know for sure if these programs truly help."
10.1002-14651858.CD013404.pub2-pls.txt,"Which are the best treatments for hip fractures in older adults?
Why is this question important? 
A hip fracture is a break at the top of the leg bone. We included people with a break just below the ball and socket joint. These types of broken hip are common in older adults whose bones may be fragile because of a condition called osteoporosis. They often happen after a fall from a standing or sitting position. The broken hip can be treated in different ways, and we don't know whether some treatments are better than others. 
What are the treatments? 
‐ Replacing the broken hip with an artificial one. This can be done using a hemiarthroplasty (HA), which replaces only the ball part of the joint, and can be unipolar (a single artificial joint) or bipolar which has an additional joint within the HA. A total hip arthroplasty (THA) replaces all of the hip joint, including the socket, and usually has just one artifical joint between the ball and the socket (single articulation) or sometimes two (dual‐mobility). All types of artificial joints can be fixed in place with or without bone cement. 
‐ Using metal implants to fix the broken parts of the bones. Pins or screws may be inserted through the two parts of broken bone, or the surgeon may use a 'fixed angle plate' which sits on the outer edge of the broken bone and is attached to the bone with screws or pins.  
‐ Treatment without an operation, usually requiring a period of rest in bed whilst the leg is held in position using traction with weights. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared one or more of these treatments. We wanted to find out the benefits and harms of these different treatments. We combined the findings from studies, and created a 'network' (which is used when researchers perform a 'network meta‐analysis' on the results from studies) to see if we could find out if some treatments were better than others. 
What did we find? 
We found 119 studies, involving 17,653 participants with 17,669 fractures. The average age of study participants ranged from 60 to 87 years; 73% were women, which is usual for people who have this type of hip fracture. We included 75 of these studies in our 'network'. 
We found that a modern design of unipolar HA fixed with bone cement, or some of the metal implants (fixed angle plates and pins), seem to have the greatest chance of reducing the number of deaths within 12 months of injury. Compared to people having these treatments, more people who were treated with an uncemented modern bipolar design of HA or with a THA (single articulation) died.  
We didn't find as many studies to include in our 'network' for health‐related quality of life, and none of the treatments made a meaningful improvement to people's quality of life.  
We also found that people treated with any of the hip replacements were less likely to need additional surgery on their broken hip than people treated with metal implants or treated without an operation. Amongst all the designs of hip replacements, fewer people needed additional surgery after treatment with a cemented modern unipolar design of HA ‐ but there was not a big difference in the findings for these hip replacement treatments. 
So, overall, cemented modern hip replacements tended to produce better outcomes and may be a more successful approach than attempting to fix the broken bone. THA (single articulation) may have increased the risk of death compared with cemented HA, without leading to an important difference in quality of life ‐ but we are not sure about this finding. This type of THA may be an appropriate treatment for some people with these fractures, but we have not studied this in this review. 
Are we confident in what we found? 
The true effects of these treatments might be very different to what we have found in this review. Many of the studies in this review were published before general reporting standards for research were improved, and so we could not be certain whether or not these studies were well‐conducted. Sometimes, the types of fractures were different (particularly between participants treated with metal implants and those treated with hip replacements), and this might have affected the results in the 'network'. We also found that the results included risks of potential benefits and harms, and this is often because there are not enough study participants to find a precise result. 
How up to date is this review? 
We ran our search in July 2020.     
","# Plain Language Summary: Hip Fracture Treatments for Older Adults

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Surgery Options to Treat Hip Breaks in Older People

## Rationale

**What is a hip fracture?**
A hip fracture is a break in the top part of the leg bone. This break happens just below the ball and socket joint of the hip. Older adults often get hip fractures because their bones become weak. This happens due to a condition called osteoporosis. Osteoporosis makes bones fragile and easy to break. Most hip fractures happen after a simple fall from standing or sitting.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors can treat broken hips in several different ways. However, they do not know which treatment works best. Some treatments use fake hip parts to replace the broken bone. Other treatments use metal pins or screws to hold the broken bone together. Some patients rest in bed without surgery. The researchers wanted to find out which treatment helps patients live longer and have better quality of life. They also wanted to know which treatment causes fewer problems.

**What did researchers hope to learn?**
The researchers wanted to compare all the different treatments. They hoped to find which treatment was safest and most helpful for older adults with hip fractures.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
The researchers looked at 119 studies that had already been done. These studies included 17,653 people with 17,669 hip fractures. The researchers combined information from 75 of these studies. They used a special method called network analysis to compare all the treatments at once.

**Who was in the studies?**
The people in these studies were between 60 and 87 years old. Most of them (73 out of 100) were women. This is common for this type of hip fracture. All participants had a break just below the hip joint.

**What treatments were compared?**
The researchers looked at several treatments:
- Fake hip parts that replace just the ball (called hemiarthroplasty or HA)
- Fake hip parts that replace the whole joint (called total hip arthroplasty or THA)
- Metal pins, screws, or plates to hold broken bones together
- Bed rest without surgery

Some fake hips were attached using bone cement. Others were not. The researchers wanted to see which option worked best.

## Results

**What did the researchers find about survival?**
Some treatments helped people live longer after their hip fracture. The best treatments were:
- Modern fake hips (unipolar type) attached with bone cement
- Metal plates and pins to fix the bone

More people died within 12 months when they received:
- Modern fake hips (bipolar type) without bone cement
- Total hip replacements (single type)

**What about quality of life?**
The researchers did not find many studies about quality of life. None of the treatments made a big difference in how people felt after treatment.

**Did people need more surgery later?**
People who got fake hip parts were less likely to need another surgery later. This was better than people who got metal pins or screws. It was also better than people who rested without surgery.

Among all the fake hip options, the modern unipolar type with bone cement worked best. Fewer people needed another surgery with this treatment. However, the difference between fake hip types was small.

**What do these results mean?**
Overall, fake hips attached with bone cement worked better than trying to fix the broken bone. Total hip replacements might increase the risk of death compared to partial hip replacements. However, the researchers are not completely sure about this finding. Total hip replacements might still be right for some patients.

**How confident are the researchers?**
The researchers are not very confident in these findings. Many studies were done before research standards improved. The researchers could not be sure if all studies were done well. Also, some studies included different types of fractures. This might have changed the results. More research with better methods is needed to be more certain.

**When was this information collected?**
The researchers searched for studies up to July 2020."
10.1002-14651858.CD013409.pub2-pls.txt,"Metal implants used to fix broken bones in the hip joint in older adults
This review assessed evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs, on the relative benefits and harms of different metal implants used to treat one type of hip fracture in older adults (aged 60 years or over). 
Background 
A hip fracture is a break at the top of the leg bone. We included people with a break just below the ball and socket joint. These types of broken hip are common in older adults whose bones may be fragile because of a condition called osteoporosis. They often happen after a fall from a standing or sitting position. A common way of mending this break is to fix the broken parts of bone with metal implants. During an operation, the surgeon may insert a smooth pin or screw through the two parts of broken bone. A smooth pin is not threaded like a screw but may have extra features such as a fold‐out hook. Alternatively, the surgeon may use a 'fixed angle plate' which sits on the outer edge of the broken bone and is attached to the bone with screws or pins. 
Search date 
We searched for RCTs (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), and quasi‐RCTs (in which people are put into groups by a method which is not randomised, such as date of birth or hospital record number), published up to 6 July 2020. 
Study characteristics 
We included 38 studies, involving 8585 adults with 8590 hip fractures. The average age of study participants ranged from 60 to 84 years; 73% were women, which is usual for people who have this type of hip fracture. 
Key results 
Smooth pins compared with fixed angle plates (four studies, 1313 participants): we are uncertain whether there is a difference between these implants in improving a person's ability to walk independently (with no more than one walking stick), in the number of people who die early (within four months of surgery) or up to 12 months after surgery, and in how many people need additional surgery (e.g. because of deep infection around the implant). 
Screws compared with fixed angle plates (11 studies, 2471 participants): we found no evidence of difference between these implants in hip function (ability to use the hip), health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), death at 12 months, and additional surgery. We are uncertain whether there is a difference between these implants in independent walking, and early deaths. 
Screws compared to smooth pins (seven studies, 1119 participants): we found no evidence of difference between these implants in deaths at 12 months. We are uncertain whether there is a difference between these implants in early deaths and additional surgery. 
Screws or pins compared with fixed angle plates (15 studies, 3784 participants): we found no evidence of difference between these implants in deaths at 12 months, or additional surgery. We are uncertain whether there is a difference between implants in independent walking and early death. We found no additional evidence for hip function or HRQoL. 
No studies in the review reported activities of daily living or delirium.
Certainty of the evidence 
Although there were some large studies, most of the evidence for each outcome came from only a few participants. Many older studies were not well reported. It was not possible to hide from the surgeons what type of fixing was used, which might affect a surgeon's decision on whether someone needed additional surgery. Sometimes, we found differences between the findings of individual studies that we could not explain. 
For these reasons, we assessed the evidence for the outcomes as either low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence. This means we had limited confidence or very little confidence in the results. 
Conclusions 
There may be little or no difference between screws and fixed angle plates in hip function, HRQoL, deaths at 12 months, and additional surgery, and between screws and pins in deaths at 12 months. But we are uncertain of the effects for other outcomes, including those for smooth pins versus fixed angle plates, because the evidence was very low‐certainty. More well‐designed RCTs on metal implants will be helpful. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Metal Implants for Fixing Broken Hips in Older Adults

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Metal Implants Used to Fix Hip Fractures in Older Adults

## Rationale

### What is a hip fracture?
A hip fracture is a break in the top part of the leg bone. This study looked at breaks that happen just below the ball and socket joint of the hip. These breaks are very common in older adults.

### Why do hip fractures happen?
Many older adults have weak bones from a condition called osteoporosis. This makes their bones break more easily. Hip fractures often happen after a simple fall from standing or sitting.

### How are these fractures treated?
Doctors fix these breaks using metal implants during surgery. There are different types of metal implants:
- **Smooth pins**: Metal rods that are not threaded. Some have special features like a fold-out hook.
- **Screws**: Metal rods with threads, like regular screws.
- **Fixed angle plates**: Metal plates that sit on the outside of the bone. Doctors attach them with screws or pins.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors need to know which type of metal implant works best. This study looked at research to find out which implants help patients the most and cause the fewest problems.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was a review study. Researchers looked at 38 earlier studies. They searched for studies published up to July 2020.

### What types of studies did they include?
They included studies where patients were randomly put into different treatment groups. They also included studies where patients were put into groups by other methods, like birth date.

### Who was in these studies?
- 8,585 older adults with hip fractures
- Average age: 60 to 84 years old
- 73% were women
- All patients were 60 years or older

### What did the studies compare?
The studies compared three types of metal implants:
1. Smooth pins
2. Screws
3. Fixed angle plates

## Results

### Smooth pins compared with fixed angle plates
Four studies looked at 1,313 patients. The researchers could not tell if one implant was better than the other. They looked at:
- How well people could walk on their own (using no more than one walking stick)
- How many people died within four months of surgery
- How many people died within 12 months
- How many people needed more surgery

### Screws compared with fixed angle plates
Eleven studies looked at 2,471 patients. The researchers found no clear difference between these implants for:
- How well the hip worked
- Quality of life
- Deaths at 12 months
- Need for more surgery

They were not sure about differences in walking ability and early deaths.

### Screws compared with smooth pins
Seven studies looked at 1,119 patients. The researchers found no clear difference in deaths at 12 months. They were not sure about early deaths and need for more surgery.

### Screws or pins compared with fixed angle plates
Fifteen studies looked at 3,784 patients. The researchers found no clear difference in:
- Deaths at 12 months
- Need for more surgery

They were not sure about walking ability and early deaths.

### What was missing?
None of the studies looked at:
- Daily activities like dressing or bathing
- Confusion after surgery (called delirium)

### What were the problems with the evidence?
The researchers had concerns about the quality of the evidence:
- Most studies had only a few patients
- Many older studies did not report their methods clearly
- Surgeons knew which implant they were using. This might have affected their decisions about more surgery.
- Some studies had different results that could not be explained

Because of these problems, the researchers had low or very low confidence in the results.

## Conclusions

Screws and fixed angle plates may work about the same for:
- How well the hip works
- Quality of life
- Deaths at 12 months
- Need for more surgery

Screws and pins may work about the same for deaths at 12 months.

However, the researchers are not sure about many other results. This is because the quality of the evidence was very low.

More high-quality studies are needed. These studies should be well-designed and include more patients. This will help doctors know which metal implant works best for older adults with hip fractures."

What is the issue?Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of osteoporosis (weakened bone strength), which can often lead to bone fracture. Several drugs are available for the treatment of osteoporosis; however, it is unknown whether these drugs are equally effective and safe in patients with CKD because bone strength impairment in these patients occurs via a different mechanism. 
What did we do?Data were collected from studies including patients with osteoporosis and CKD stages 3‐5, and those undergoing dialysis (stage 5D) with data available on fracture, change in the bone mineral density (BMD; a bone strength index), and adverse events. We included seven studies with available evidence up to 25 January 2021, comparing anti‐osteoporotic drugs (abaloparatide, alendronate, denosumab, raloxifene, and teriparatide) with placebo (a dummy drug), in 9,164 postmenopausal women. We performed a meta‐analysis to assess the effects of these anti‐osteoporotic drugs. 
What did we find?In postmenopausal women with CKD stages 3‐4, anti‐osteoporotic drugs may reduce vertebral fracture in low certainty evidence. Anti‐osteoporotic drugs probably make little or no difference to clinical fracture and adverse events in moderate certainty evidence. In postmenopausal with CKD stages 5 or 5D, it is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug reduces the risk of clinical fracture and death, and anti‐osteoporotic drug may slightly improve BMD at the lumbar spine in low certainty evidence. It is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug improve BMD at the femoral neck. 
ConclusionsAmong postmenopausal women with CKD stages 3‐4, anti‐osteoporotic drugs may reduce the risk of vertebral fracture. Among patients with CKD stages 5 and 5D, anti‐osteoporotic drug may slightly improve bone strength. However, these conclusions are based on limited data and therefore uncertain.

## Plain Title
Bone-Strengthening Drugs for Women with Kidney Disease and Weak Bones

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some people have long-term kidney disease. This means their kidneys do not work well. People with kidney disease often get weak bones. Doctors call this osteoporosis. Weak bones break more easily. This can cause pain and make daily life hard.

**Why does this happen?**

When kidneys do not work well, bones become weak in a different way than in people with healthy kidneys. Doctors are not sure if the usual bone drugs work the same way for people with kidney disease.

**Why was this study needed?**

Many drugs can help make bones stronger. But doctors need to know if these drugs work well and are safe for people with kidney disease. This study looked at whether these drugs help prevent broken bones in people with kidney disease.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a single study. Researchers looked at seven different studies that were already done. They combined the results to see the bigger picture.

**Who was in these studies?**

All the people in the studies were women past menopause. This means they had stopped having monthly periods. There were 9,164 women total. All of them had both weak bones and kidney disease.

The researchers grouped the women by how bad their kidney disease was:
- Stages 3-4: Kidneys still work a little bit
- Stage 5: Kidneys work very poorly
- Stage 5D: Kidneys do not work at all, so patients need dialysis (a machine that cleans the blood)

**What treatments were tested?**

The studies tested five different bone drugs. These drugs were compared to fake pills (called placebo). The drugs tested were:
- Abaloparatide
- Alendronate
- Denosumab
- Raloxifene
- Teriparatide

**What did researchers measure?**

Researchers looked at three main things:
- How many bones broke
- How much bone strength changed
- What side effects happened

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The results were different based on how bad the kidney disease was.

**For women with stage 3-4 kidney disease:**

The bone drugs may help prevent spine bones from breaking. However, researchers are not very sure about this finding. The drugs probably do not change how many other bones break. The drugs probably do not cause more side effects than fake pills.

**For women with stage 5 or 5D kidney disease:**

Researchers are not sure if the drugs prevent broken bones. They are also not sure if the drugs affect how long people live. The drugs may make spine bones a little bit stronger. But researchers are not sure if the drugs make hip bones stronger.

**What do these results mean?**

For women with less severe kidney disease (stages 3-4), bone drugs might help prevent spine breaks. For women with very severe kidney disease (stages 5 and 5D), bone drugs might make bones slightly stronger. But there is not enough information to be certain.

**Why are researchers not sure?**

Only seven studies were available. More research is needed with more patients. This would help doctors know for sure if these drugs work well and are safe.

**What is the main conclusion?**

Bone drugs may help some women with kidney disease and weak bones. But doctors need more information before they can be sure these drugs work well for all patients with kidney disease. More studies are needed.

10.1002-14651858.CD013432.pub2-pls.txt,"Mepolizumab or benralizumab for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
Background to the question 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung condition in which people can experience severe difficulties with breathing and an associated reduction in their quality of life. 
For people with COPD, episodes in which the condition of patients seriously worsens are a major concern. We examined the findings of clinical trials to see whether mepolizumab or benralizumab, two new drugs, are better than placebo (dummy treatment) for people with COPD, and whether they reduce the number of episodes when the condition of patients seriously worsens. 
Study characteristics 
Six clinical studies compared either mepolizumab or benralizumab to placebo in a total of 5542 people with COPD. We examined the findings of the studies in terms of episodes when patients' conditions flared up requiring additional treatment, patient quality of life, patient performance in breathing tests, and side effects of the medication. 
Main results 
Three studies used mepolizumab, and the other three studies used benralizumab.
Mepolizumab 100 mg reduced the rate of flare‐ups in a group of people with both COPD and higher levels of blood eosinophils (a type of white blood cells involved in inflammatory and allergic reactions). When mepolizumab is given in a higher dose (300 mg or 750 mg) the rate of flare‐ups is probably reduced. 
Benralizumab at a dose of 100mg resulted in a clear reduction in the number of episodes requiring admission to hospital, and when given at a lower dose (10mg) probably reduces flare‐ups requiring hospitalisation. This is in people with COPD and higher levels of blood eosinophils. 
Further studies comparing mepolizumab or benralizumab to a placebo may provide more clarity on the role of these drugs for COPD. 
Quality of the evidence 
The included studies were for the most part very well‐designed and robust, and the evidence was generally of high quality.

## Plain Title
Testing Two New Drugs (Mepolizumab and Benralizumab) for People with Chronic Lung Disease

## Rationale

**What is COPD?**
COPD stands for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is a long-term lung condition. People with COPD have trouble breathing. This makes daily life very hard. Their quality of life goes down.

**What happens with COPD?**
People with COPD have episodes called flare-ups. During a flare-up, their breathing gets much worse. These episodes are very serious. Some flare-ups require hospital care. Flare-ups are a major worry for people with COPD.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors wanted to test two new drugs. The drugs are called mepolizumab and benralizumab. These drugs might help people with COPD. The drugs work on a type of white blood cell. These cells are called eosinophils. Eosinophils can cause swelling in the lungs. Some people with COPD have high levels of these cells in their blood.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Researchers wanted to know if these drugs work better than a dummy treatment. A dummy treatment is called a placebo. They wanted to see if the drugs reduce flare-ups. They also wanted to know if the drugs are safe.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at six clinical studies. These studies tested the two drugs in people with COPD. The studies compared the drugs to a placebo. A placebo looks like the real drug but has no medicine in it.

**Who was in the studies?**
A total of 5,542 people with COPD took part. All participants had COPD. Many had high levels of eosinophils in their blood. The studies included both men and women. The studies included adults of different ages.

**What did researchers measure?**
Researchers looked at several things:
- How many flare-ups happened
- Whether flare-ups needed hospital care
- How well people could breathe
- Quality of life for patients
- Side effects from the drugs

**How long did the studies last?**
The abstract does not say exactly how long. Different studies may have lasted different amounts of time.

## Results

**What did the studies find about mepolizumab?**
Three studies tested mepolizumab. The drug was given at different doses. The doses were 100 mg, 300 mg, or 750 mg.

Mepolizumab at 100 mg reduced flare-ups. This worked in people with COPD and high eosinophil levels. Higher doses (300 mg or 750 mg) probably also reduced flare-ups.

**What did the studies find about benralizumab?**
Three studies tested benralizumab. The drug was given at different doses. The doses were 10 mg or 100 mg.

Benralizumab at 100 mg clearly reduced hospital visits. This was for serious flare-ups. The lower dose (10 mg) probably also reduced hospital visits. This worked in people with COPD and high eosinophil levels.

**How good was the evidence?**
The studies were well-designed. The evidence was high quality. This means we can trust the results.

**What do the results mean for patients?**
These drugs may help some people with COPD. They work best for people with high eosinophil levels. The drugs can reduce serious flare-ups. Fewer flare-ups mean better quality of life. Fewer hospital visits mean less disruption to daily life.

**What comes next?**
More studies are needed. Future studies will help doctors understand these drugs better. They will show exactly which patients benefit most. They will confirm how safe the drugs are over time.

**Main conclusions:**
Both mepolizumab and benralizumab show promise for treating COPD. They help reduce flare-ups in certain patients. These are patients with high eosinophil levels. The drugs may offer a new treatment option. This is good news for people living with COPD."

Review question 
Are bone marrow cells safe and effective as a treatment for non‐ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)? 
Background 
DCM is a disorder of the heart muscle with heart dilation (heart muscle becomes stretched) and impaired contraction, in the absence of high blood pressure, damaged or diseased heart valves, or heart disease present at birth or related to myocardial infarction (heart attack). The current standard of treatment is based on medicines and cardiac devices. However, DCM is still one of the leading causes of heart transplantation in adults. 
Stem cells are special cells produced in the bone marrow that are able to develop into many different cell types. Giving stem cells directly into the heart muscle has been proposed as an alternative treatment to reduce or stop further deterioration in heart function in people with DCM. 
Study characteristics 
We selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing the infusion of bone marrow‐derived stem cells into the heart muscle with the usual‐care (control) treatment in people diagnosed with DCM. We searched multiple databases for trials up to 10 November 2020. 
We included 13 RCTs involving 762 participants (452 receiving stem cell therapy and 310 controls). The trials included people with severe symptoms of ischaemic (following a heart attack) and non‐ischaemic DCM. We selected only the data from non‐ischaemic DCM. 
The studies included an average of 60 people aged about 45 to 58.5 years and 50% to 89% men in each trial. Following therapy, the participants were assessed for six months to five years, with most at one year. One study declared a private funding whereas seven others had public or governmental funding, two had non‐profit funding, and four did not report this information. 
Key results 
SCT versus control: very low‐quality evidence reflects uncertainty regarding mortality, procedural complications, health‐related quality of life and exercise capacity. Low‐quality evidence suggests that SCT may slightly improve deterioration of heart function and may not increase the risk of abnormal heartbeats in people with DCM. No studies reported other relevant outcomes such as major cardiac adverse events. 
STC plus cytokine versus control: very low‐quality evidence reflects uncertainty regarding mortality. Low‐quality evidence suggests that SCT plus cytokine may not improve health‐related quality of life but may improve exercise capacity as well as some physiological measures related to cardiac function (although it is unclear to what extent these latter outcomes are associated with relevant clinical benefits for patients). Hence, the results should be interpreted with caution. Very low‐quality evidence reflects uncertainty regarding procedural complications. No studies reported major cardiac adverse events or abnormal heartbeats. 
Due to the limited number of studies we could not perform analyses to identify which specific features of SCT and clinical characteristics of patients are associated with better results. Thus, more research is needed to establish the role of SCT in the treatment of DCM and the most effective therapies. 
Quality of evidence 
The evidence in this review is of low to very low quality due to the small number of events, results not similar across studies, risk of bias, and issues with study design. Furthermore, the limitations in the reporting of most studies made it difficult to obtain and use the information to reach clearer conclusions. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Bone Marrow Cells as Treatment for Non-Ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy

## Plain Title
Can bone marrow cells help treat people with a stretched and weak heart muscle?

## Rationale

### What is the condition?
Some people have a heart problem called dilated cardiomyopathy, or DCM. In DCM, the heart muscle becomes stretched out and weak. This makes it hard for the heart to pump blood well. People with DCM did not have a heart attack. They also do not have high blood pressure or damaged heart valves. They were not born with this heart problem.

### Why is this a problem?
DCM makes people feel very tired and weak. Their hearts cannot pump blood the way they should. Right now, doctors treat DCM with medicines and special heart devices. But these treatments do not always work well enough. Many people with DCM still get worse. Some need a heart transplant. DCM is one of the main reasons adults need new hearts.

### What is the new treatment being studied?
Doctors wanted to test a new treatment. They used special cells from bone marrow. Bone marrow is the soft tissue inside bones. It makes special cells called stem cells. Stem cells can turn into many different types of cells in the body. Doctors thought these cells might help fix damaged heart muscle. They put the stem cells directly into the heart muscle. The hope was that this would stop the heart from getting worse. It might even help the heart work better.

### Why was this study needed?
Researchers needed to find out if bone marrow cells are safe. They also needed to know if this treatment really helps people with DCM.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked at 13 different studies. These studies tested bone marrow cell treatment in people with DCM. The studies were randomized controlled trials. This means people were put into groups by chance. Some people got the stem cell treatment. Other people got usual care only.

### Who was in the studies?
The studies included 762 people total. Of these, 452 people got stem cell treatment. The other 310 people were in control groups. Each study had about 60 people. Most people in the studies were between 45 and 58 years old. About half to almost all were men. All had DCM with severe symptoms.

### How long did the studies last?
After treatment, doctors checked on people for different lengths of time. Some studies lasted six months. Others lasted up to five years. Most studies followed people for one year.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

**Stem cell treatment compared to usual care:**
- The researchers were very uncertain about several things. They could not tell if the treatment changed how many people died. They could not tell if it changed quality of life. They could not tell if it changed how well people could exercise. They also were not sure about problems during the procedure.
- The treatment might slightly help keep the heart from getting worse. But the evidence was weak.
- The treatment probably does not cause more abnormal heartbeats. But again, the evidence was weak.
- No studies looked at major heart problems.

**Stem cell treatment plus a special protein compared to usual care:**
- Researchers were very uncertain about how many people died.
- This combination might not improve quality of life. But it might help people exercise better.
- It might improve some heart measurements. But doctors do not know if these changes really help patients feel better.
- Researchers were very uncertain about problems during the procedure.
- No studies looked at major heart problems or abnormal heartbeats.

### What do the results mean?
The evidence is not strong enough to know if bone marrow cells really help people with DCM. More research is needed. Doctors need to find out which patients might benefit most. They also need to find the best way to give this treatment.

### Why is the evidence weak?
The studies were small. The results were different across studies. Some studies had problems with how they were done. Many studies did not report all their information clearly. This made it hard to reach clear conclusions."
10.1002-14651858.CD013438-pls.txt,"Beta‐blockers to prevent death or serious events after surgery not involving the heart
This review assessed evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on whether beta‐blockers reduce deaths or other serious events when given to people undergoing surgery other than heart surgery. The findings for heart surgery are covered in another review. 
Background 
Surgery increases stress in the body, which responds by releasing the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline. Stress from surgery can lead to death or other serious events such as heart attacks, stroke, or an irregular heartbeat. For surgery that does not involve the heart, an estimated 8% of people may have injury to their heart around the time of surgery. Beta‐blockers are drugs that block the action of adrenaline and noradrenaline on the heart. Beta‐blockers can slow down the heart, and reduce blood pressure, and this may reduce the risk of serious events. However, beta‐blockers may lead to a very low heart rate or very low blood pressure which could increase the risk of death or a stroke. Prevention of early complications after surgery is important, but using beta‐blockers to prevent these complications is controversial. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to 28 June 2019. We included 83 RCTs with 14,967 adults who were undergoing different types of surgery other than heart surgery. Eighteen studies are awaiting classification (because we did not have enough details to assess them), and three studies are ongoing. The types of beta‐blockers used in the studies were: propranolol, metoprolol, esmolol, landiolol, nadolol, atenolol, labetalol, oxprenolol, and pindolol. Studies compared these beta‐blockers with either a placebo (disguised to look like a beta‐blocker but containing no medicine) or with standard care. 
Key results 
Beta‐blockers may make little or no difference to the number of people who die within 30 days of surgery (16 studies, 11,446 participants; low‐certainty evidence), have a stroke (6 studies, 9460 participants; low‐certainty evidence), or experience ventricular arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat rhythms, starting in the main chambers of the heart, that are potentially life‐threatening and may need immediate medical treatment; 5 studies, 476 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We found that beta‐blockers may reduce atrial fibrillation (an irregular heartbeat, starting in the atrial chambers of the heart, that increases the risk of stroke if untreated; 9 studies, 9080 participants; low certainty‐evidence), and the number of people who have a heart attack (12 studies, 10,520 participants; low‐certainty evidence). However, taking beta‐blockers may increase the number of people who experience a very low heart rate (49 studies, 12,239 participants; low‐certainty evidence), or very low blood pressure (49 studies, 12,304 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), around the time of surgery. 
In a few studies, we also found little or no difference in the number of people who died after 30 days, who died because of a heart problem, or had heart failure. We found no evidence of whether beta‐blockers alter the length of time in hospital. 
No studies assessed whether people who were given beta‐blockers had a better quality of life after heart surgery. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence in this review was limited by including some studies that were at high risk of bias, and we noticed that some of our findings were different if we only included placebo‐controlled studies or studies that reported how participants were randomized. We also found one large, well‐conducted, international study that had different findings to the smaller studies. It showed a reduction in heart attacks and an increase in stroke and all‐cause mortality when beta‐blockers were used, whilst the other studies did not show a clear effect. We were also less certain of the findings for outcomes with few studies, such as for ventricular arrhythmias. 
Conclusion 
Although beta‐blockers may make little or no difference to the number of people who die within 30 days, have a stroke, or have ventricular arrhythmias, they may reduce atrial fibrillation and heart attacks. Taking beta‐blockers may increase the number of people with a very low heart rate or very low blood pressure around the time of surgery. Further evidence from large, placebo‐controlled trials is likely to increase the certainty of these findings, and we recommend the assessment of impact on quality of life. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Beta-Blockers to Prevent Death or Serious Problems After Surgery (Not Heart Surgery)

## Plain Title

Can Beta-Blocker Drugs Prevent Death or Serious Health Problems in People Having Surgery That Does Not Involve the Heart?

## Rationale

**What happens during surgery?**

Surgery puts stress on the body. When this happens, the body releases two hormones called adrenaline and noradrenaline. These hormones make the heart work harder and faster.

**Why is this a problem?**

This stress can cause serious health problems. About 8 out of every 100 people having surgery may have heart injury around the time of their operation. Some people may die. Others may have heart attacks, strokes, or dangerous heart rhythm problems.

**What are beta-blockers?**

Beta-blockers are drugs that block adrenaline and noradrenaline. They slow down the heart. They also lower blood pressure. Doctors think these drugs might prevent serious problems during surgery.

**Why might beta-blockers be risky?**

Beta-blockers can sometimes slow the heart too much. They can also make blood pressure drop too low. This could cause death or stroke.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors disagree about using beta-blockers during surgery. This study looked at research to find out if beta-blockers help or harm people having surgery.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 83 studies. These studies included 14,967 adults. All of these people were having surgery that did not involve the heart.

**What did the studies compare?**

Some people got beta-blockers. Other people got a placebo or standard care. A placebo looks like medicine but contains no active drug.

The beta-blockers used included: propranolol, metoprolol, esmolol, landiolol, nadolol, atenolol, labetalol, oxprenolol, and pindolol.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included adults having different types of surgery. None of the surgeries involved the heart.

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies tracked people for at least 30 days after surgery. Some studies followed people for longer.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

Beta-blockers may make little or no difference in:
- How many people die within 30 days of surgery
- How many people have a stroke
- How many people have dangerous heart rhythms starting in the main heart chambers

**What might beta-blockers help prevent?**

Beta-blockers may reduce:
- Irregular heartbeat starting in the upper heart chambers (this is called atrial fibrillation)
- Heart attacks

**What problems might beta-blockers cause?**

Beta-blockers may increase:
- Very slow heart rate
- Very low blood pressure

These problems happen around the time of surgery.

**What else did researchers find?**

A few studies looked at deaths after 30 days. They found little or no difference. The same was true for deaths from heart problems and heart failure.

No studies looked at how long people stayed in the hospital. No studies checked if people felt better after taking beta-blockers.

**How certain are these findings?**

The researchers are not completely certain about these results. Some studies had problems with how they were done. One large, well-done study found different results than smaller studies. That large study showed beta-blockers reduced heart attacks but increased strokes and deaths.

**What do the researchers conclude?**

Beta-blockers may not change how many people die within 30 days. They may not affect strokes or dangerous heart rhythms. But they may help prevent irregular heartbeat and heart attacks. They may cause very slow heart rate or very low blood pressure.

More large, well-designed studies are needed. Future studies should check if beta-blockers improve quality of life after surgery.

10.1002-14651858.CD013440.pub2-pls.txt,"Improving the outcome of people with primary brain tumours and their carers using early palliative interventions 
Why this question is important 
Brain tumours can have a significant impact on people and their carers. Brain tumours can impair people's physical, neurocognitive, and social functioning, which can affect the whole family, particularly informal caregivers, who often receive inadequate support. There is evidence in other cancers that providing access to palliative support in the early stages of a person's illness can help to improve their, and their caregivers', quality of life. However, it has not been confirmed that this is the case for people with brain tumours. 
Objectives 
We aimed to assess studies that included early palliative care interventions, including referral to specialist palliative care services compared to usual care, for improving outcomes in adults diagnosed with a primary brain tumour and their carers. 
How we searched for evidence 
We searched electronic medical literature databases for studies that included a range of different types of medical trials, both published and ongoing. We handsearched the reference lists of key papers and searched for key authors of research in the area. We included adults confirmed with a primary brain tumour and informal caregivers such as relatives. 
What we found 
We could not find any trials examining the impact of specialist palliative care teams on outcomes for patients or their carers. We included one trial which focused on a single symptom area – that of cognition – in a patient group of whom about half had a high‐grade tumour. The trial randomised patients between a group receiving a structured cognitive rehabilitation intervention and a group receiving usual rehabilitation care of medications and physiotherapy. Cognitive rehabilitation consisted of supervised computer‐based exercises, lasting 45 minutes at a time, four times a week, over a four‐week period. There was no important difference between the two groups apart from some improvement in visual attention and verbal memory in those who received the cognitive rehabilitation intervention. However, we assessed the certainty of the evidence as being very low, and we could find no evidence in this or other studies on any other aspect of palliative care. 
What this means 
Not enough research has been undertaken on early palliative care interventions which support people with primary brain tumours, and their caregivers. Research is needed which examines co‐ordinated approaches to overall palliative care provision, and interventions which focus on specific aspects of palliation in this population. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Can Early Comfort Care Help People with Brain Tumors and Their Families?

## Rationale

**What is the problem?**

Brain tumors are growths in the brain that can cause serious problems. They can make it hard for people to move, think, and spend time with others. These problems affect the whole family, especially those who care for the person with a brain tumor at home.

Family members who provide care often do not get enough help or support. This can be very hard on them.

**What is palliative care?**

Palliative care is special care that helps people feel better. It focuses on comfort and quality of life. It helps manage pain and other symptoms. It also provides support for families.

**Why was this study needed?**

Studies of other types of cancer show that palliative care helps when it starts early. It can improve quality of life for both patients and their caregivers. However, no one knew if this was true for people with brain tumors.

The researchers wanted to find out if early palliative care could help people with brain tumors and their families. They looked for studies that tested this idea.

## Trial Design

**How did the researchers look for answers?**

The researchers searched medical databases for studies. They looked for trials that tested early palliative care in adults with brain tumors. They also looked for studies that included family caregivers.

They searched published studies and ongoing trials. They checked reference lists from important papers. They looked for work by key researchers in this area.

**What did they find?**

The researchers could not find any trials about specialist palliative care teams. They found only one small trial to include.

This trial focused on one specific problem: thinking and memory issues. About half the patients in this trial had fast-growing tumors.

**What did this one trial test?**

The trial divided patients into two groups. One group received special brain training exercises. The other group received usual care, which included medicines and physical therapy.

The brain training program used computer exercises. Patients did these exercises for 45 minutes at a time. They did them four times each week. The program lasted four weeks.

The trial included adults with brain tumors. It did not include information about caregivers.

## Results

**What did the study show?**

The brain training program showed small improvements. Patients who did the exercises had slightly better visual attention. They also had slightly better verbal memory. These are types of thinking skills.

However, most other measures showed no important differences between the two groups.

**How strong is this evidence?**

The researchers rated the quality of this evidence as very low. This means we cannot be sure about the results. The study was small and had limitations.

**What does this mean?**

There is not enough research on early palliative care for people with brain tumors. Almost no studies have been done in this area.

The researchers found no evidence about:
- Specialist palliative care teams
- Support for family caregivers
- Managing pain or other symptoms
- Improving quality of life
- Coordinated care approaches

**What is needed?**

More research is urgently needed. Studies should test:
- Complete palliative care programs that address all patient needs
- Support programs for family caregivers
- Ways to manage specific symptoms
- Coordinated care that brings different services together

People with brain tumors and their families need better support. Right now, we do not have enough evidence to know what works best."
10.1002-14651858.CD013443.pub2-pls.txt,"Medicines for preventing post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
Why is this review important? 
Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe and disabling condition which may develop in people exposed to traumatic events. Such events can have long‐lasting negative repercussions on the lives of those who have experienced them, as well as on the lives of loved ones. 
Research has shown that there are some alterations in how the brain works in people with PTSD. Some researchers have thus proposed using medicines to target these alterations soon after a traumatic event, as a way to prevent the development of PTSD. However, the majority of people who experience a traumatic event will not develop PTSD. Therefore, medicines that can be given soon after exposure to a traumatic event must be carefully evaluated for their effectiveness, including balancing the risk of side effects against the risk of developing PTSD. 
Who will be interested? 
‐ People exposed to traumatic events and their family, friends, and loved ones
‐ Professionals working in mental health 
‐ Professionals working in traumatology and emergency medicine
‐ People caring for victims of traumatic experiences and veterans of the armed forces
What questions did this review try to answer? 
For people exposed to a traumatic event, whether or not they have psychological symptoms, are some medicines more effective than other medicines or placebo (dummy pills) in: 
‐ reducing the severity of symptoms of PTSD?
‐ reducing the number of people stopping the medication because of side effects?
‐ reducing the probability of developing PTSD?
Which studies were included? 
We searched scientific databases for studies in which participants were randomly assigned to a medicine with the aim of preventing PTSD and its symptoms or reducing severity. We included studies published up until November 2020. We selected studies in adults who had experienced any kind of traumatic event, and which provided treatment, regardless of whether or not the participants had psychological symptoms. 
We included 13 studies, with a total of 2023 participants. One study alone contributed 1244 participants. The studies took place in different settings and involved people exposed to a wide range of traumatic events. Some studies took place in emergency departments and considered people whose trauma resulted from intentional harm or unintentional harm. Other studies focused on life‐threatening illness as the source of trauma, including major surgeries or being admitted to intensive care units. The medicines most commonly given to participants in the studies included: hydrocortisone (which reduces the body's immune response), propranolol (used to treat heart problems and anxiety, amongst other conditions), and gabapentin (a medicine primarily used to treat seizures and nerve pain). 
What did the evidence tell us? 
We found four trials comparing hydrocortisone to placebo. These trials did not report how participants were doing at three months after a traumatic event, a time point that is usually useful to assess the evolution of PTSD symptoms. 
We found very low‐certainty evidence about propranolol compared to placebo three months after a traumatic event. This evidence does not tell us whether or not propranolol is more effective than placebo in reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms and the probability of developing PTSD. We did not find evidence on the probability of people stopping the medication because of side effects, quality of life, or functional disability (a measure of how much one’s life is limited by symptoms). 
We found very low‐certainty evidence about gabapentin compared to placebo three months after a traumatic event. This evidence does not tell us whether or not gabapentin is more effective than placebo in reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms and the probability of developing PTSD. We did not find evidence on the probability of people stopping the medication because of side effects, quality of life, or functional disability. 
We found studies on additional medicines, for which information about the reduction of PTSD severity and the probability of people stopping the medication was either inconclusive or missing. 
None of the included studies measured the functional disability of participants.
What should happen next? 
The evidence we found does not support the use of any medicines for the prevention of PTSD in people exposed to a traumatic event, regardless of whether or not they have psychological symptoms. More higher quality studies involving more people are needed to draw conclusions about these treatments. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Can Medicines Help Prevent PTSD After a Traumatic Event?

## Plain Title

Can medicines given soon after a traumatic event prevent post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)?

## Rationale

**What is PTSD and why does it matter?**

PTSD stands for post-traumatic stress disorder. It is a serious mental health problem. PTSD can happen to people who go through very scary or harmful events. These events might include car crashes, attacks, serious illness, or major surgery.

PTSD can make life very hard. People with PTSD may have bad dreams. They may feel scared or upset often. They may avoid places or people that remind them of what happened. PTSD affects not just the person who has it, but also their family and friends.

**What do we know about PTSD?**

Scientists have found that PTSD changes how the brain works. Most people who go through scary events do not get PTSD. But some do. Scientists wanted to know if giving medicine soon after a scary event could stop PTSD from happening.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors need to know if these medicines really work. They also need to know if the medicines are safe. Medicines can have side effects. Doctors must decide if the benefits are worth the risks. This is especially important because most people will not get PTSD even without medicine.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked for studies done by other scientists. They searched for studies published up to November 2020. They found 13 studies. These studies included 2,023 people in total. One large study had 1,244 people.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included adults who had been through traumatic events. Some people went to emergency rooms after accidents or attacks. Some people had serious illnesses. Some had major surgery. Some were in intensive care units.

The studies gave people different medicines. Some people got real medicine. Others got placebo (fake pills that look like medicine but have no active ingredients). Neither the doctors nor the patients knew who got which type.

**What medicines were tested?**

The most common medicines tested were:
- Hydrocortisone: This medicine affects the body's stress response
- Propranolol: This medicine treats heart problems and anxiety
- Gabapentin: This medicine treats seizures and nerve pain

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies checked on people at different times. Some checked at three months after the traumatic event. This is an important time to see if PTSD symptoms develop.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found that the evidence was not strong enough to recommend any medicine for preventing PTSD.

**Hydrocortisone findings:**

Four studies tested hydrocortisone against placebo. These studies did not report results at three months. This made it hard to know if the medicine helped prevent PTSD.

**Propranolol findings:**

Some studies tested propranolol. The evidence quality was very low. The researchers could not tell if propranolol worked better than placebo. They could not tell if it reduced PTSD symptoms. They could not tell if it stopped people from getting PTSD. Information about side effects and quality of life was missing.

**Gabapentin findings:**

Some studies tested gabapentin. Again, the evidence quality was very low. The researchers could not tell if gabapentin worked better than placebo. Information about side effects and how the medicine affected daily life was missing.

**Other medicines:**

Other medicines were also tested. But the information was either unclear or missing.

**Important missing information:**

None of the studies measured how much PTSD symptoms limited people's daily activities. This is important information for understanding how well treatments work.

**What do these results mean?**

The evidence does not support giving medicines to prevent PTSD after a traumatic event. This is true whether or not people have symptoms right after the event.

**What happens next?**

More and better studies are needed. These studies need more people in them. They need to measure the right things at the right times. Only then can doctors know if these medicines really help prevent PTSD."
10.1002-14651858.CD013444.pub2-pls.txt,"Cannabis and cannabinoids for people with multiple sclerosis
Key messages• Treatment with nabiximols likely results in improvement of spasticity and may not increase serious harmful effects compared with placebo 
• Compared with placebo, cannabinoids (nabiximols, Cannabis extract, synthetic cannabinoids) likely improve well‐being when measured with patient‐reported outcomes  
• Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefit of these medicines for treating chronic neuropathic pain is unclear. 
What is the issue? 
Many people with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience spasticity that causes also pain and impacts on the ability to carry out daily activities. Spasticity is a form of increased muscle tone. Cannabis‐based medicines refer to the use of Cannabis, or its ingredients called cannabinoids, as medical therapies to alleviate spasticity, chronic pain and other symptoms in MS. An international survey found that MS was one of the five medical conditions for which Cannabis was most often used. Another survey conducted in the UK found that more than one in five people with MS reported they had used Cannabis to try to manage their symptoms.  
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if cannabinoids were better than placebo in adults with MS to improve: 
• spasticity;
• chronic neuropathic pain;
• well‐being,
We also wanted to find out if cannabinoids were associated with:
• treatment discontinuation due to unwanted effects; 
• serious harmful effects;
• nervous system disorders or psychiatric disorders;
• drug tolerance defined as a condition that occurs when the body gets used to a medicine so that more medicine is needed. 
What did we do?We searched for studies that compared cannabinoids against placebo in adult people with MS. We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and certainty of evidence. 
What did we find?  
We found 25 studies that involved 3763 people with MS, 2290 of whom received cannabinoids. Fifteen studies were very short term or short‐term studies (two to 12 weeks), seven were intermediate term (12 to 26 weeks), and two were long term (50 and 156 weeks). One study reported results at three days only. The biggest study was conducted in 657 people and the smallest study involved 14 people. Most studies were done in European countries. Thirteen studies evaluated an oral spray (nabiximols) containing two compounds derived from the Cannabis plant. The other studies compared different cannabinoids with placebo. Pharmaceutical companies funded 15 of the studies. 
Main results 
Compared with placebo, cannabinoids: 
• probably increase the number of people who report an important reduction of perceived severity of spasticity for up to 14 weeks (evidence from five studies in 1143 people); 
• may increase the number of people who report an important reduction of perceived severity of chronic neuropathic pain, but the evidence is very uncertain (evidence from one study in 48 people). 
We are uncertain whether cannabinoids reduce chronic neuropathic pain intensity:
• probably increase the number of people who perceive their well‐being as 'very much' or 'much' improved (evidence from eight studies in 1215 people); 
• may increase slightly the number of people who discontinue treatment due to unwanted effects (evidence from 21 studies in 3110 people); 
• may result in little to no difference in the number of people who have serious harmful effects (evidence from 20 studies in 3124 people); 
• may increase nervous system disorders (evidence from seven studies in 1154 people) or psychiatric disorders (evidence from six studies in 1122 people); 
• may have little to no effect on the number of people who have drug tolerance, but the evidence is very uncertain (two studies in 458 people). 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
There is no high‐quality evidence. 
We are moderately confident that cannabinoids work better versus no cannabinoids to improve severity of spasticity and well‐being in adults with MS. We have little confidence in our results for the effect on chronic neuropathic pain because the available evidence is limited. 
There is limited evidence to determine the effects of cannabinoids on serious harmful effects, nervous system or psychiatric disorders, and drug tolerance. 
How up to date is the evidence?The evidence is up‐to‐date to December 2021. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Cannabis-Based Medicines for People with Multiple Sclerosis

## Plain Title
Do cannabis-based medicines help people with multiple sclerosis manage their symptoms?

## Rationale

**What is multiple sclerosis?**
Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is a long-term health condition. It affects the brain and nerves. Many people with MS have tight, stiff muscles. This is called spasticity. Spasticity can cause pain. It can make daily tasks hard to do.

**Why did researchers do this study?**
Many people with MS try cannabis to feel better. Surveys show that MS is one of the top five conditions for which people use cannabis. In the UK, more than one in five people with MS have tried it. Cannabis contains substances called cannabinoids. Doctors want to know if these substances really help. They want to know if cannabinoids can reduce muscle stiffness and pain. They also want to know if these medicines are safe.

**Why might cannabinoids help?**
Cannabinoids come from the cannabis plant. Some are made in labs. These substances may help relax tight muscles. They may also reduce pain. Doctors think cannabinoids might improve how people with MS feel overall.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at 25 different studies. These studies tested cannabinoids in adults with MS. The studies compared cannabinoids to placebo. A placebo is a fake treatment with no active medicine.

**Who was in these studies?**
A total of 3,763 people with MS took part. Of these, 2,290 people received cannabinoids. The rest received placebo.

**How long did the studies last?**
Most studies were short. Fifteen studies lasted 2 to 12 weeks. Seven studies lasted 12 to 26 weeks. Two studies were long. They lasted 50 weeks and 156 weeks. One study was very short. It lasted only three days.

**What types of cannabinoids were tested?**
Thirteen studies tested an oral spray called nabiximols. This spray contains two substances from cannabis. Other studies tested different types of cannabinoids. Some were natural. Some were made in labs.

**Where were the studies done?**
Most studies took place in European countries. Drug companies paid for 15 of the studies.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

**For muscle stiffness (spasticity):**
Cannabinoids probably help reduce muscle stiffness. More people who used cannabinoids felt their muscles were less stiff. This effect lasted up to 14 weeks. Five studies with 1,143 people showed this result.

**For long-term nerve pain:**
The results for pain are unclear. One small study with 48 people suggested cannabinoids might help. But researchers are not sure. More studies are needed.

**For overall well-being:**
Cannabinoids probably help people feel better overall. More people who used cannabinoids said they felt ""much better"" or ""very much better."" Eight studies with 1,215 people showed this result.

**For safety:**
Cannabinoids may cause some people to stop treatment. This happens because of unwanted effects. But cannabinoids probably do not cause more serious harm than placebo. Twenty studies with 3,124 people showed this.

Some people had nervous system problems. These included dizziness or trouble thinking. Some people had mental health problems. These included feeling anxious or confused. Seven studies with 1,154 people showed nervous system problems. Six studies with 1,122 people showed mental health problems.

**For drug tolerance:**
Drug tolerance means the body gets used to a medicine. Then more medicine is needed. Researchers are not sure if this happens with cannabinoids. Only two studies looked at this. The evidence is weak.

**What do these results mean?**
Cannabinoids, especially nabiximols spray, likely help reduce muscle stiffness in people with MS. They likely help people feel better overall. They may not cause serious harm. But they may cause some side effects. More research is needed to understand if cannabinoids help with long-term nerve pain.

**How strong is this evidence?**
The evidence for muscle stiffness and well-being is moderate. Researchers are fairly confident in these results. The evidence for pain and safety is weak. More high-quality studies are needed.

**How current is this information?**
This review includes studies published up to December 2021."
10.1002-14651858.CD013446-pls.txt,"Regimens of vitamin D supplementation for women during pregnancy
What is the issue? 
This review evaluated if there are beneficial effects of supplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation (200 international units/day (IU/d) to 600 IU/d) on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes and to evaluate if there are negative health effects when using more than the current upper limit recommendation (4000 IU/d). 
Why is this important? 
Vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy compared to no supplementation appears to decrease the risk of pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birthweight and may reduce the risk of severe postpartum haemorrhage. However, it is not clear if doses greater than the currently recommended level are needed to observe these health benefits, and if giving more than the upper limit is related to adverse events. 
What was studied in the review? 
This review included trials evaluating the effect of different vitamin D regimens (doses, frequencies, duration, and times of commencement) to compare the effects of 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less, of vitamin D alone or with any other nutrient on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes. 
What evidence did we find? 
Evidence from 19 trials involving 5214 women suggest that supplementation with 601 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes but may make little or no difference to the risk of pre‐eclampsia, preterm birth or low birthweight compared to women receiving 600 IU/d or less. 
Evidence from 15 trials involving 4763 women suggests that supplementation with 4000 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth or low birthweight compared to women receiving 3999 IU/d or less. 
Adverse events were reported differently in most trials; in general, there was little to no side effects reported or similar cases between groups. 
What does this mean? 
Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes; however, it may make little or no difference in the risk of the other outcomes. Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current upper limit for vitamin D seems not to increase the risk of the outcomes evaluated. Vitamin D supplementation appears to be safe. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Testing Different Amounts of Vitamin D Supplements for Pregnant Women

## Rationale

**What is vitamin D and why does it matter during pregnancy?**

Vitamin D is a nutrient that helps keep bones strong and supports the body in many ways. During pregnancy, getting enough vitamin D is important for both the mother and baby's health.

**What problems can happen during pregnancy?**

Some women develop health problems while pregnant. These include pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure that can be dangerous), gestational diabetes (high blood sugar during pregnancy), having a baby born too early, or having a baby with low birth weight. These conditions can cause serious health issues for mothers and babies.

**What do we already know?**

Earlier studies showed that taking vitamin D during pregnancy may help prevent some of these problems. However, doctors were not sure how much vitamin D pregnant women should take to get the best results.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors currently recommend that pregnant women take between 200 and 600 units of vitamin D each day. The upper safe limit is set at 4000 units per day. Researchers wanted to find out if taking more than the current recommendation would provide extra health benefits. They also wanted to make sure that higher doses were safe and did not cause harm.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 19 different studies that tested vitamin D supplements in pregnant women. They compared two main things:
- Higher doses (more than 600 units per day) versus lower doses (600 units or less per day)
- Very high doses (4000 units or more per day) versus moderate doses (less than 4000 units per day)

**Who was in the studies?**

A total of 5,214 pregnant women took part in these studies. The studies included women of different ages who were healthy enough to be pregnant.

**How long did the studies last?**

Women took vitamin D supplements throughout their pregnancy. The exact length of time varied depending on when they started taking the supplements during pregnancy.

**What did researchers measure?**

Researchers tracked whether women developed pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes. They also checked if babies were born too early or had low birth weight. They watched for any side effects or health problems from taking vitamin D.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

When pregnant women took more than 600 units of vitamin D per day, they had a lower chance of developing gestational diabetes. This is good news because gestational diabetes can cause problems for both mother and baby.

However, taking higher doses did not seem to change the risk of other problems. Women taking higher doses had similar rates of pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, and low birth weight babies compared to women taking lower doses.

When researchers looked at very high doses (4000 units or more per day), they found these amounts did not increase or decrease the risk of any of the health problems they studied.

**Was vitamin D safe?**

Most studies reported few or no side effects from taking vitamin D. When side effects did occur, they happened at similar rates in all groups. This suggests that vitamin D supplements are safe during pregnancy, even at higher doses.

**What does this mean for pregnant women?**

Taking more vitamin D than currently recommended may help prevent gestational diabetes. For other pregnancy problems, higher doses do not seem to provide extra benefits. The good news is that vitamin D appears safe, even at doses higher than the current upper limit.

**Final thoughts**

Pregnant women can safely take vitamin D supplements. Taking more than the standard amount may help reduce the risk of gestational diabetes. Women should talk with their doctor about the right amount of vitamin D for their individual needs."
10.1002-14651858.CD013447-pls.txt,"What are clients' experiences and perceptions of receiving health information via their mobile phones? 
What is the aim of this synthesis? 
The aim of this Cochrane qualitative evidence synthesis was to explore clients' views and experiences of being communicated with by the health system through their mobile phone. Our synthesis looked at communication about pregnancy, newborn, and child health, sexual health, and family planning. By synthesis we mean the bringing together and synthesising of results from primary qualitative studies into a larger whole. We collected all relevant studies and included 35 studies in the synthesis. 
This synthesis links to other Cochrane Reviews that assess the effectiveness of this type of targeted digital health communication. 
Key messages 
Many clients like receiving messages from the health services by mobile phone. However, some clients have problems receiving messages due to lack of network access, internet, or phone, or language, reading, or privacy issues. Clients' experiences are also influenced by message timing, frequency, content, and sender. 
What did we study in the synthesis? 
Governments and health systems are starting to use mobile phones to communicate with clients. When the information is targeted at particular people or groups of people, and when the health system decides when and what to communicate, this is called 'digital targeted client communication.' Common types of digital targeted client communication are text messages that remind people to go to appointments or to take their medicines. Other types include phone calls or video messages that offer healthcare information, advice, monitoring, and support. 
We looked for studies of clients' views and experiences of targeted communication by mobile phone. We focused on communication with pregnant women and parents of young children, and with adults and teenagers about sexual health and family planning. 
What are the main findings of the synthesis? 
We included 35 studies from around the world. These studies showed that clients' experiences of these types of programmes were mixed. Some felt that these programmes provided them with feelings of support and connectedness, as they felt that someone was taking the time to send them messages (moderate confidence in the evidence). Others also described sharing the messages with their friends and family (moderate confidence). 
However, clients also pointed to problems when using these programmes. Some clients had poor access to cell networks and to the internet (high confidence). Others had no phone, had lost or broken their phone, could not afford airtime, or had changed their phone number (moderate confidence). Some clients, particularly women and teenagers, had their access to phones controlled by others (moderate confidence). The cost of messages could also be a problem, and many thought that messages should be free of charge (high confidence). Languages issues as well as clients' skills in reading, writing, and using mobile phones could also be a problem (moderate confidence). 
Clients dealing with stigmatised or personal health conditions such as HIV, family planning, or abortion care were concerned about privacy and confidentiality (high confidence). Some suggested strategies to deal with these issues, such as using neutral language and tailoring the content, timing, and frequency of messages (high confidence). 
Clients wanted messages at a time and frequency that was convenient for them (moderate confidence). They had preferences for different delivery channels (e.g. short message service (SMS) or interactive voice response) (moderate confidence). They also had preferences about message content, including new knowledge, reminders, solutions, and suggestions about health issues (moderate confidence). Clients' views about who sent the digital health communication could influence their views of the programme, and many people wanted a sender that they knew and trusted (moderate confidence). 
How up‐to‐date is the synthesis?

","# Plain Language Summary: What Patients Think About Getting Health Messages on Their Mobile Phones

## Plain Title
What Do Patients Think About Receiving Health Information Through Text Messages and Phone Calls?

## Rationale

### What Did We Want to Learn?
Many people around the world now have mobile phones. Health systems are starting to use these phones to send health information to patients. These messages might remind people to take their medicine or go to doctor visits. They might also give advice about staying healthy.

We wanted to understand what patients think about getting these messages. Do they find them helpful? Are there any problems?

### Why Is This Important?
Health systems need to know if patients like getting messages on their phones. If patients have problems with these messages, the health systems need to fix these problems. This helps make sure the messages actually help people stay healthy.

### What Health Topics Did We Look At?
We looked at messages about:
- Pregnancy and caring for babies and young children
- Sexual health
- Family planning

These are important health topics. Many people need information and support in these areas.

## Trial Design

### How Did We Do This Study?
We looked for studies from around the world. These studies asked patients what they thought about getting health messages on their phones. We found 35 studies that fit what we were looking for.

We read all these studies carefully. Then we put together what patients said across all the studies. This helped us see the big picture of what patients think.

### Who Was in These Studies?
The studies included:
- Pregnant women
- Parents of young children
- Adults and teenagers learning about sexual health and family planning

The studies came from many different countries.

## Results

### What Did We Find?

#### What Patients Liked
Many patients liked getting health messages on their phones. They felt supported and cared for. Someone was taking time to help them. This made them feel connected to their health system.

Some patients shared the messages with family and friends. This helped spread helpful health information to more people.

#### What Problems Did Patients Have?

**Phone and Network Problems**
Some patients could not get messages because:
- Their area had poor cell phone service
- They had no internet access
- They did not own a phone
- Their phone was lost or broken
- They could not afford to pay for phone service
- They changed their phone number

**Control Over Phones**
Some patients did not control their own phones. This was especially true for women and teenagers. Other family members controlled when they could use the phone.

**Cost Problems**
Messages that cost money were a problem. Many patients thought health messages should be free.

**Reading and Language Problems**
Some patients had trouble:
- Reading the messages
- Understanding the language used
- Using their mobile phone

**Privacy Concerns**
Patients worried about privacy for personal health topics. These topics included HIV, family planning, and abortion care. They did not want others to see their private health messages.

Patients suggested ways to fix this problem:
- Use neutral language that does not reveal the health topic
- Let patients choose when messages arrive
- Let patients choose how many messages they get

#### What Patients Wanted

**Timing and Frequency**
Patients wanted messages at times that worked for them. They wanted to control how many messages they got.

**Type of Message**
Patients had different preferences. Some liked text messages. Others liked voice messages. Patients wanted to choose what worked best for them.

**Message Content**
Patients wanted messages that included:
- New health information
- Reminders about appointments or medicine
- Solutions to health problems
- Helpful suggestions

**Who Sends the Message**
Patients cared about who sent the messages. Many wanted messages from someone they knew and trusted. This made them more likely to read and follow the advice.

### What Does This Mean?
Mobile phone messages can help patients. But health systems need to fix several problems first. They need to make sure:
- Messages are free or low cost
- Messages are private
- Patients can read and understand messages
- Patients can choose when and how they get messages
- Messages come from trusted sources

When health systems fix these problems, more patients will benefit from mobile health messages.

### How Current Is This Information?
We looked at studies published up to July 2017."
10.1002-14651858.CD013453.pub2-pls.txt,"Targeted treatment of non‐small cell lung cancer with an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene mutation 
Background 
The most common type of lung cancer is non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). About 5% of NSCLC will be driven by a gene mutation known as anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Targeted treatments for those with advanced (not curable) ALK‐mutated NSCLC cancer have been developed and found to be more effective than chemotherapy. The first ALK inhibitor to be developed was crizotinib. Newer ALK‐targeted drugs have also been developed and include ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, ensartinib, and lorlatinib. In this review we looked at treatments that target ALK‐mutated NSCLC to find out how well they work. 
Objectives  
The primary objective of this review was to find out whether people with ALK‐mutated NSCLC given treatments targeted towards ALK live longer without recurrence and have fewer side effects than those treated with chemotherapy. We also planned to evaluate whether newer ALK‐targeted drugs achieve this better than crizotinib.  
Study characteristics 
We searched the main medical databases and records of conferences up to 7 January 2021. We found 11 studies (2874 participants): six studies compared an ALK‐targeted drug to chemotherapy, and five studies compared a newer ALK‐targeted drug to crizotinib. The studies were conducted in people with advanced ALK‐mutated NSCLC using these drugs as their first or later treatment. A total of five different ALK inhibitors were used across studies: alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, crizotinib, and lorlatinib. 
Results 
People treated with ALK‐targeted drugs lived longer without their cancer growing than those on chemotherapy. These improvements were also seen in people with cancer that had spread to the brain. People receiving ALK‐targeted drugs lived longer overall, even when some had received chemotherapy first. ALK‐targeted drugs cause a similar number of side effects as chemotherapy. ALK‐targeted drugs caused more tumours to reduce in size and resulted in a longer time until worsening of symptoms when compared to chemotherapy.  
People treated with newer ALK‐targeted drugs lived longer without their cancer growing than those receiving crizotinib, including in people with cancer involving the brain. People treated with newer ALK‐targeted drugs as first treatment were likely to live longer overall with a similar number of overall side effects. Newer ALK‐targeted drugs caused more tumours to reduce in size when compared to crizotinib. 
The evidence for most reported measures was of moderate or high certainty.
Conclusions 
The best first treatment for people with incurable ALK‐mutated lung cancer is a newer ALK inhibitor such as alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, or lorlatinib. More studies are needed to determine which of these options is best and what treatment should be used when the cancer grows after these medicines have been given. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Treatment for a Type of Lung Cancer with a Specific Gene Change

## Plain Title
Targeted Drugs for Lung Cancer with ALK Gene Changes Work Better Than Chemotherapy

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**

Lung cancer is a serious disease. The most common type is called non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC. About 5 out of every 100 people with NSCLC have a change in a gene called ALK. This gene change makes the cancer grow. When cancer has spread and cannot be cured, it is called advanced cancer.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors created special drugs that target the ALK gene change. These are called ALK inhibitors. The first drug made was crizotinib. Then doctors made newer drugs: ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, ensartinib, and lorlatinib. These drugs work differently than chemotherapy. Chemotherapy kills fast-growing cells in the body. ALK inhibitors target only the cancer cells with the ALK gene change.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know if ALK inhibitor drugs work better than chemotherapy. They also wanted to know if newer ALK drugs work better than crizotinib. They looked at how long people lived without their cancer getting worse. They also looked at side effects.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review of many studies. Researchers looked at medical records and conference reports. They searched up to January 7, 2021. They found 11 studies with 2,874 people total.

**Who was in the studies?**

All people in the studies had advanced NSCLC with the ALK gene change. Some people were getting their first treatment. Others had already tried other treatments. The studies included both men and women of different ages.

**What did the studies compare?**

Six studies compared an ALK drug to chemotherapy. Five studies compared a newer ALK drug to crizotinib. The studies used five different ALK drugs: alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, crizotinib, and lorlatinib.

**How long were people in the studies?**

The length of time varied by study. People stayed in studies until their cancer got worse or they had serious side effects.

## Results

**What did researchers find about ALK drugs versus chemotherapy?**

People taking ALK drugs lived longer without their cancer growing. This was true even when cancer had spread to the brain. People taking ALK drugs also lived longer overall. This was true even though some people switched to chemotherapy later. ALK drugs caused about the same number of side effects as chemotherapy. More tumors shrank with ALK drugs than with chemotherapy. People taking ALK drugs went longer before their symptoms got worse.

**What did researchers find about newer ALK drugs versus crizotinib?**

People taking newer ALK drugs lived longer without their cancer growing. This was better than crizotinib. This was true for cancer in the brain too. People taking newer ALK drugs as first treatment lived longer overall. They had about the same number of side effects as crizotinib. More tumors shrank with newer ALK drugs than with crizotinib.

**How reliable were these findings?**

Most of the evidence was of moderate or high quality. This means researchers are fairly confident in the results.

**What do these results mean?**

The best first treatment for people with advanced ALK-mutated lung cancer is a newer ALK drug. Good choices include alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, or lorlatinib. These drugs help people live longer without cancer growth. They work better than chemotherapy and better than crizotinib.

**What is still unknown?**

More studies are needed to answer two questions. First, which newer ALK drug is best? Second, what treatment should people get when cancer grows after taking these drugs?

**Conclusions**

Doctors should use newer ALK inhibitor drugs as the first treatment for people with advanced lung cancer that has the ALK gene change. These drugs help people live longer and control their cancer better than older treatments."
10.1002-14651858.CD013458.pub2-abstract.txt,"An overview of systematic reviews on mental health interventions for involuntary migrants
Refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons are involuntary migrants, who have often experienced distress when forced to leave their home, on the journey, and in the process of settling in a host country or new environment. Mental health promotion, prevention, and treatments for mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and post‐traumatic stress disorder may work differently in these groups of people than for the general population. This overview of systematic reviews summarises the characteristics of reviews available on this topic, to help us determine which research questions are the most important to address in future Cochrane reviews. 
We searched for systematic reviews and protocols of systematic reviews on mental health promotion, prevention, and treatment of mental health problems for refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons. Mental health promotion may, for example, involve a classroom‐based well‐being intervention for children. An example of prevention is trauma‐focused therapy to prevent post‐traumatic stress disorder. Treatment may, for example, include psychological therapy for depression. We found 23 systematic reviews and 15 protocols of reviews in progress. Together the 23 published systematic reviews included 336 references, 175 of which were unique studies. Reviews more commonly included refugees and asylum seekers than internally displaced persons, and were more frequently focused on adults than children. There was more attention on the treatment of post‐traumatic stress disorder than there was for mental health promotion or prevention, or for the treatment of depression or anxiety. Studies of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Narrative Exposure Therapy, and integrative and interpersonal therapies were most likely to be included in reviews. 
The quality of reviews was limited by a range of issues, many of which related to poor reporting of the review methodology. 
The evidence available from systematic reviews may not match the need for evidence‐based interventions for the mental health of involuntary migrants. Review authors should consider relevant groups such as internally displaced persons, children, and people with depression or anxiety, and relevant interventions such as those for mental health promotion or prevention, and treatments other than psychological therapy. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Mental Health Help for People Forced to Leave Their Homes

## Plain Title
A Review of Studies About Mental Health Care for Refugees and People Forced to Move

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some people must leave their homes because of war, danger, or other serious problems. These people include refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons. Refugees and asylum seekers cross borders to other countries. Internally displaced persons move to safer areas within their own country.

**Why does this matter?**

Leaving home by force is very hard. These people often face stress and fear. This happens when they must leave. It happens during their journey. It also happens when they try to settle in a new place.

Many of these people develop mental health problems. Common problems include feeling very sad, feeling worried or scared, and having bad memories of scary events. Doctors call these depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder.

**Why was this study needed?**

Mental health treatments that work for most people might work differently for involuntary migrants. Researchers wanted to understand what studies have been done. They wanted to find gaps in our knowledge. This would help them know what research is most needed next.

The goal was to look at all the reviews about mental health help for these groups. A review is a study that gathers many smaller studies together.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was an overview of systematic reviews. The researchers looked for reviews about mental health care for involuntary migrants.

They searched for three types of mental health care:
- Mental health promotion helps people feel better and stay well
- Prevention stops mental health problems before they start
- Treatment helps people who already have mental health problems

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found 23 completed reviews. They also found 15 reviews still in progress. The 23 completed reviews included 336 references. Of these, 175 were unique studies.

**Who was included in these reviews?**

Most reviews looked at refugees and asylum seekers. Few reviews included internally displaced persons. More reviews studied adults than children.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The researchers found important gaps in the available reviews.

Most reviews focused on treating post-traumatic stress disorder. Few reviews looked at mental health promotion or prevention. Few reviews studied treatment for depression or anxiety.

Most reviews studied talk therapy approaches. Common types included Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Narrative Exposure Therapy. These help people change their thoughts or talk about their experiences.

**What were the problems with the reviews?**

Many reviews had quality problems. The biggest issue was poor reporting. Many reviews did not clearly explain how they were done. This makes it hard to trust their results.

**What does this mean?**

The available research does not match what involuntary migrants need. Important groups are being left out. These include internally displaced persons and children. Important health problems are being ignored. These include depression and anxiety.

Important types of help are not being studied enough. These include mental health promotion and prevention programs.

**What should happen next?**

Future reviews should study the groups and problems that have been ignored. Researchers should look at:
- Internally displaced persons
- Children and young people
- Depression and anxiety
- Mental health promotion and prevention
- Different types of treatment beyond talk therapy

Better quality reviews are needed. Reviews must clearly explain their methods. This will help doctors and health workers know what treatments really work for people forced to leave their homes."
10.1002-14651858.CD013465.pub2-pls.txt,"Individualized versus standard diet fortification for growth and development in very low birth weight infants receiving human milk 
Review question: does individualized rather than standard, non‐individualized addition of nutrients and calories to breast milk feeds safely improve growth and other outcomes in preterm infants? 
Background: preterm infants are at risk for poor growth following birth. Breast milk reduces their risk of illness but does not meet their nutritional needs. Therefore, breast milk fed to preterm infants must be fortified with extra nutrients. Usual methods of fortifying breast milk treat all breast milk and all preterm infants the same. However, two methods are available for individualizing fortification for each preterm infant. Targeted fortification adds nutrients to breast milk based on the results of breast milk analysis. Adjustable fortification adds nutrients based on the results of preterm infant laboratory results. Individualized fortification may improve preterm infant growth or other outcomes. However, it is not known whether targeted or adjustable fortification is safe or improves outcomes for preterm infants compared with the standard method. 
Study characteristics: through literature searches updated to September 2019, we found seven studies that tested the effects of targeted or adjustable fortification of breast milk feeds compared to standard fortification in preterm infants, yielding eight publications (521 total participants were enrolled in these studies). One study that was published after our literature search was completed is awaiting classification. 
Key results: targeted or adjustable fortification improves short‐term growth compared to standard fortification in preterm infants. Determining the best way to customize breast milk feeds is necessary, as is clarifying its safety and effects on other clinical outcomes. 
Certainty of evidence: very low to moderate. Moderate certainty means that the true effect of individualized fortification on growth in preterm infants is likely to be close to the result of this review but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Low certainty means that the true effect may be substantially different from the results of this review. Very low certainty means that the true effect of individualized fortification on growth in preterm infants is likely to be substantially different from the results of this review. Certainty of evidence was downgraded most often in this review due to small numbers of participants in included studies and significant differences in study design and outcome measures among included studies.

## Plain Title
Custom-Made Nutrition Added to Breast Milk for Very Small Premature Babies: Does It Help Them Grow Better?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Babies born too early (premature babies) often have trouble growing well after birth. These tiny babies need good nutrition to grow and develop properly.

**Why is breast milk important but not enough?**

Breast milk is the best food for premature babies. It helps protect them from getting sick. However, breast milk alone does not have enough nutrients and calories for very small premature babies. These babies need extra nutrition to grow properly.

**What do doctors currently do?**

Doctors add extra nutrients to breast milk. This is called fortification. The standard way treats all breast milk the same. It also treats all premature babies the same. Every baby gets the same amount of extra nutrients.

**What is the new approach being studied?**

Researchers wanted to test a custom-made approach. This means making the nutrition fit each baby's specific needs. There are two ways to do this:

1. Test the breast milk to see what nutrients it has. Then add what is missing.
2. Test the baby's blood to see what the baby needs. Then add those specific nutrients.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors do not know if custom-made fortification is safe. They also do not know if it works better than the standard method. This study looked at the research to find answers.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this question?**

Researchers looked for all studies that compared custom-made fortification to standard fortification. They searched medical databases through September 2019.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included very small premature babies. These babies were fed breast milk with added nutrients. A total of 521 babies were in seven different studies.

**What did the studies compare?**

Some babies got standard fortification. All babies in this group got the same extra nutrients added to their breast milk.

Other babies got custom-made fortification. The extra nutrients were chosen based on either breast milk tests or baby blood tests.

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies measured how well babies grew in the short term. This means weeks to a few months after birth.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

Custom-made fortification helped premature babies grow better in the short term. Babies who got custom nutrition gained more weight and grew more than babies who got standard fortification.

**How certain are these results?**

The certainty of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. This means:

- Moderate certainty: The true effect is probably close to what this review found. But it might be somewhat different.
- Low certainty: The true effect might be quite different from what this review found.
- Very low certainty: The true effect is likely very different from what this review found.

**Why is the certainty not higher?**

The studies had some problems:
- The studies were small. They did not include many babies.
- The studies were done in different ways.
- The studies measured different things.

**What still needs to be learned?**

Researchers need to answer important questions:
- What is the best way to customize breast milk for each baby?
- Is custom-made fortification safe for all premature babies?
- Does it help with other health outcomes besides growth?
- Does it help babies in the long term as they get older?

**What do these results mean?**

Custom-made fortification shows promise for helping very small premature babies grow better. However, more research is needed. Doctors need larger studies to be sure this approach is safe and works well. They also need to know the best way to customize nutrition for each baby.

One more study was found after the search ended. It is waiting to be reviewed."

Background 
Abdominal aortic graft infections are a serious complication following aortic aneurysm surgery. They can be managed in two ways: either with surgery or medical management. Surgery is currently the mainstay of treatment and is usually performed by two methods, one of which involves removing and replacing the infected graft, and the other bypassing the infected graft. Medical management commonly involves a long‐term course of antibiotics. Medical management avoids the risk of potential complications of surgery, but requires use of antibiotics for several months, or even lifelong. There is currently no agreement on which intervention (surgical or medical) is the most effective in managing abdominal aortic graft infections. In emergency or complex situations such as graft rupture, surgical management is the only option, whilst for those unfit for surgery, medical management is the preferred option. However, in non‐emergency situations, it is often personal preference that influences the healthcare provider's decision‐making. This review aimed to assess and compare the effects of surgical and medical interventions for abdominal aortic graft infections. 
Study characteristics and key results 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) to December 2019. We found no trials that met our inclusion criteria. Hence there is currently insufficient evidence to draw conclusions relating to the effects of surgical and medical interventions for abdominal aortic graft infections. 
Conclusion 
Multicentre randomised controlled trials are required to identify the most effective method of treating aortic graft infection. By doing this, 'gold standard' guidelines can be formulated so that all patients can receive the same level of treatment without regard for where they are being treated. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Comparing Surgery and Medicine to Treat Infections in Abdominal Aorta Grafts: A Review of Studies

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**
Some people need surgery to fix a weak spot in their abdominal aorta. This is the large blood vessel in the belly. Doctors put in a graft during this surgery. A graft is a tube that replaces the weak part. Sometimes, this graft gets infected. This is a serious problem.

**Why is this a burden for patients?**
Graft infections can make people very sick. They can be life-threatening. Patients need treatment to fight the infection.

**What treatments are available?**
Doctors can treat these infections in two ways. The first way is surgery. Doctors can remove the infected graft and put in a new one. Or they can create a new path around the infected graft. The second way is medicine. Patients take antibiotics for a long time. This might be for months or even for life.

**Why was this study needed?**
Right now, doctors do not agree on which treatment works best. Surgery can have risks and problems. But medicine means taking antibiotics for a very long time. In emergencies, surgery is the only choice. For people too sick for surgery, medicine is better. But when there is no emergency, doctors often choose based on what they prefer. This is not ideal.

**What was the goal?**
The researchers wanted to find out which treatment works better. They wanted to compare surgery and medicine for treating these graft infections.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**
The researchers looked for a special type of study. These are called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, patients are put into different treatment groups by chance. This helps make fair comparisons.

The researchers searched for all studies up to December 2019. They looked for studies that compared surgery to medicine for abdominal aortic graft infections.

**What did they find?**
The researchers found no studies that met their needs. There were no randomized controlled trials comparing these two treatments.

## Results

**What were the main results?**
The researchers could not find any good quality studies. Because of this, they could not answer their question. They do not know which treatment works better.

**What does this mean?**
Right now, there is not enough proof to say if surgery or medicine is better. Doctors cannot use research to guide their choices. This means treatment may be different depending on where a patient goes. Some doctors may prefer surgery. Others may prefer medicine.

**What do the researchers conclude?**
New studies are badly needed. These studies should be randomized controlled trials. They should include many hospitals and many patients. These studies would help find the best way to treat graft infections.

With good research, doctors could create standard guidelines. These guidelines would be the ""gold standard."" This means all patients would get the same high-quality care. It would not matter which hospital they go to. Every patient would receive the best treatment based on solid evidence.

**Why is this important?**
Abdominal aortic graft infections are serious. Patients need the best possible treatment. Right now, treatment choices are not based on strong evidence. They are based on doctor preference. This is not good enough. Patients deserve to know which treatment gives them the best chance of getting better. More research will help answer this important question."
10.1002-14651858.CD013479-pls.txt,"Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines and the number of doses administered to prevent HPV‐related disease in females and males 
Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are a group of viruses that infect the skin and mucous membranes. Some types of HPV are sexually transmitted and are common in young people. Most infections will be cleared by the immune system, but some people will experience persistent infection with certain HPV types that go on to cause abnormalities in infected cells. These changes are called 'precancerous' because they can develop into cancers of the cervix, vagina, vulva, anal canal, penis, and head and neck. Infection with other HPV types causes warts in the genital area or around the anus. 
Vaccination aims to prevent future HPV infections. Three HPV vaccines are in use – a bivalent one (protects against two HPV types), a quadrivalent one (protects against four HPV types), and a nonavalent one (protects against nine HPV types). In women, three doses of the bivalent or the quadrivalent HPV vaccines protect against precancer of the cervix caused by the HPV types contained in the vaccine. Evidence about the nonavalent vaccine, about the effects of the quadrivalent vaccine in males, and about the effects of HPV vaccines in people with HIV infection, has not yet been reviewed thoroughly. Uptake of HPV vaccines remains low in many countries. Simpler vaccine schedules, or giving the vaccine to both girls and boys, could increase the number of people being vaccinated. 
Trials of HPV vaccines are not always designed to collect data about precancer and cancer, for several reasons. Firstly, HPV vaccine is routinely given before girls become sexually active, and it is not ethical to take specimens from the cervix of girls who have not had sex. Secondly, HPV‐related precancer and cancer are rare and do not develop until years after HPV infection has occurred. Thirdly, participants in a trial will be offered treatment if precancer develops, so progression to cervical cancer would be even rarer, even without vaccination. An international committee of experts states that, in some circumstances, antibody levels (i.e. showing a strong immune system response), can be used to demonstrate protection against cervical and anal cancer. The antibody levels following vaccination in a trial should not be lower than those found in other studies on adults in whom the vaccine has been shown to protect against severe HPV‐related cervical or anal disease. 
Review question(s) 
How effective or harmful are different HPV vaccine schedules (i.e. number and timing of doses) and different HPV vaccines in females and males? 
Main results 
These results are based on research evidence to 27 September 2018. We analysed 20 studies involving 31,940 people. 
Studies comparing two doses of HPV vaccine to three doses, or comparing the time interval between doses, focus on immune system responses rather than infection or disease outcomes. Two doses of HPV vaccine result in similar immune system responses to three doses, and a longer interval (up to 12 months) between doses gives a stronger immune system response than a shorter interval. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference between the vaccine schedules for serious adverse events and death. 
In 16‐ to 26‐year‐old men, one study showed evidence of moderate certainty that a quadrivalent HPV vaccine provides better protection against external genital lesions and genital warts than a dummy treatment (control). In 16‐ to 26‐year‐old women, one study showed that the nonavalent and quadrivalent vaccines provide the same levels of protection against cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions and cancer (high‐certainty evidence). 
There was evidence that the quadrivalent vaccine resulted in more local adverse events (such as pain, swelling, and redness at the injection site) than a control treatment in males, and that the nonavalent vaccine resulted in more local adverse events than the quadrivalent vaccine in males and females. Evidence about serious adverse events and deaths from studies comparing different HPV vaccine types or dose schedules was of low or very low‐certainty. 
In people living with HIV, HPV vaccines result in reasonable levels of immune system response, but evidence about their effects on persistent HPV infection or HPV‐related disease outcomes and harms is limited. 
Certainty of the evidence 
No major issues were identified with the methodological quality of the studies for the measurements of infection and disease outcomes, or for immune system responses. Our certainty in the evidence about serious harms and deaths across all the studies comparing different HPV vaccines and vaccine schedules is low, either because of their low frequency, or because the evidence is indirect, or both. Evidence graded as high certainty means that we were confident that further research is unlikely to change our findings. Moderate‐certainty evidence means that there is a possibility that further research may have an important effect on our findings, whilst low‐certainty evidence means that our confidence was limited and further research may have an important impact on our findings. Very low‐certainty evidence means that we were uncertain about the result. 
Conclusion 
A two‐dose schedule of HPV vaccines in young females results in immune system responses that are comparable with a three‐dose schedule. In males, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine appears to be effective in the prevention of external genital lesions and genital warts. Quadrivalent and nonavalent HPV vaccines in young women result in similar levels of protection against cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions and cancer. Evidence about the efficacy and harms in people living with HIV is limited. Further long‐term population‐level studies are needed to continue monitoring safety of these vaccines, to determine for how long two doses of vaccine can provide protection against HPV‐related disease, the effect against HPV‐related cancer, and whether a two‐dose immunisation schedule will increase vaccine coverage. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing HPV Vaccines and Dosing Schedules

## Plain Title
Comparing Different HPV Vaccines and Number of Doses to Prevent HPV-Related Diseases in Women and Men

## Rationale

**What is HPV and why does it matter?**

HPV stands for human papillomavirus. This is a group of viruses that can infect the skin and the moist areas of the body. Some types of HPV spread through sexual contact. These viruses are very common in young people.

**What happens after HPV infection?**

Most people's bodies clear HPV on their own. However, some people have infections that do not go away. These lasting infections can cause cell changes. These changes can turn into cancer over time. HPV can cause cancers of the cervix, vagina, vulva, anus, penis, head, and neck. Other types of HPV cause warts in the genital area.

**Why was this study needed?**

Three HPV vaccines exist. One protects against two HPV types. Another protects against four types. The newest protects against nine types. We know that three doses of the first two vaccines protect women from cervical precancer. However, we need more information. We need to know if fewer doses work as well. We need to know if the newest vaccine works as well. We need to know if the vaccines work in men. We also need to know if they work in people with HIV.

**Why study different dose schedules?**

Many people do not get HPV vaccines. Simpler schedules might help more people get vaccinated. If two doses work as well as three, more people might complete their vaccines.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers reviewed 20 studies. These studies included 31,940 people total. The research was current through September 2018.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included both females and males. Most participants were between 16 and 26 years old. Some studies included people living with HIV.

**What did researchers compare?**

Researchers looked at several things:
- Two doses versus three doses of vaccine
- Different time gaps between doses
- Different types of vaccines
- Vaccines versus dummy treatments
- How well vaccines work in different groups of people

**What did researchers measure?**

Some studies measured immune system response. This means they checked antibody levels in the blood. Other studies measured actual infections and diseases. They also tracked side effects and serious health problems.

## Results

**Main findings about dose schedules:**

Two doses of HPV vaccine create a similar immune response as three doses. When doses are spaced further apart (up to 12 months), the immune response is stronger. This is better than doses given closer together.

**Findings in young men (ages 16 to 26):**

One study showed the four-type vaccine works well in men. It protects against genital lesions and genital warts. It works better than a dummy treatment.

**Findings in young women (ages 16 to 26):**

One study compared the nine-type and four-type vaccines. Both vaccines provided the same level of protection. They protected against precancer and cancer of the cervix, vagina, and vulva. Researchers are very confident in this finding.

**Findings about side effects:**

The vaccines caused some local side effects. These include pain, swelling, and redness where the shot was given. The four-type vaccine caused more of these effects than dummy treatment in males. The nine-type vaccine caused more of these effects than the four-type vaccine in both males and females.

Researchers found limited evidence about serious side effects and deaths. This is because these events are rare. More research is needed in this area.

**Findings in people with HIV:**

HPV vaccines create reasonable immune responses in people with HIV. However, there is limited evidence about how well the vaccines prevent infection or disease in this group.

**What do these results mean?**

Two doses of HPV vaccine work as well as three doses in young females. The vaccines protect against precancer and cancer. The four-type vaccine prevents genital warts and lesions in males. The nine-type and four-type vaccines work equally well in young women.

**What is still needed?**

More long-term studies are needed. Researchers need to track how long two doses provide protection. They need to see if two-dose schedules help more people get vaccinated. They also need more information about safety over time and effects on cancer rates.

**How certain are these findings?**

Researchers are very confident about findings on infection and disease prevention. They are less certain about serious side effects and deaths. This is because these events are rare or the evidence is indirect."
10.1002-14651858.CD013483.pub2-pls.txt,"How accurate are contrast‐enhanced ultrasound scans for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma?
Key messages 
In adults with chronic liver disease, contrast‐enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can miss diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma in around 22.2% of people who would not then receive timely or appropriate treatment, and would fail to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma in 6.2% of people who could receive unnecessary further testing or treatment. 
In the subset of people who are able have the hepatocellular carcinoma removed by surgery, CEUS probably misses hepatocellular carcinoma in 22.5% of people who could undergo surgery to remove part of their liver while it would erroneously find cancer in 7.3% of people who would undergo unnecessary further test or surgery. 
As there were some problems with the way the studies were conducted, CEUS to detect hepatocellular carcinoma may appear more accurate than it actually is. 
Why is improving the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma important? 
Hepatocellular carcinoma is cancer originating in the liver. It is sixth in terms of occurrences of cancer and fourth in terms of cancer‐related deaths worldwide. It occurs mostly in people with chronic liver disease regardless of the exact cause. People with blood test or ultrasound results that suggest they may have hepatocellular carcinoma may go on to have further tests, such as imaging or a biopsy (where a small piece of the liver is removed and examined). If the cancer is detected early, people may have part of the liver removed or have a liver transplant. In advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, they may need chemotherapy. If hepatocellular carcinoma is missed at diagnostic testing, people will not receive appropriate treatment. However, incorrectly diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma when it is not present means that people may undergo unnecessary testing or treatment. 
What is contrast‐enhanced ultrasound and how can it diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma? 
CEUS can detect abnormalities in the liver that might be due to cancer and, using contrast agents, confirm the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. These contrast agents are safe. CEUS is used in clinical practice to confirm the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma in people in whom suspicion was raised by prior performed abdominal ultrasound or a blood test to measure alpha‐foetoprotein. 
The role of CEUS in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma remains controversial between guidelines. Previous systematic reviews have assessed the performance of CEUS in detecting hepatocellular carcinoma but they have included different studies and found different results. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if CEUS is accurate enough to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma in adults with chronic liver disease (a progressive deterioration of liver functions for more than six months). We were interested first in hepatocellular carcinoma of any size and severity and, second, in hepatocellular carcinomas that were suitable for surgical removal (resection). 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed the accuracy of diagnostic tests of CEUS scans compared to the best available tests to confirm hepatocellular carcinoma in adults with chronic liver disease. The best available test is examination of the liver, or part of it, under a microscope. 
What did we find? 
We found 23 studies with 6546 adults.
Around 690 (69%) out of 1000 adults with chronic liver disease had a confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma of any size and severity. Considering these 1000 people, CEUS: 
– correctly detected liver cancer in 537 people;
– missed liver cancer in 153 people;
– incorrectly detected cancer in 19 people;
– correctly detected no cancer in 291 people.
Around 690 (69%) out of 1000 adults with chronic liver disease had a confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma that could be removed by surgery. Considering these 1000 people, CEUS: 
– correctly detected liver cancer in 535 people;
– missed liver cancer in 155 people;
– incorrectly detected cancer in 23 people;
– correctly detected no cancer in 287 people.
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the evidence is limited as the studies used different methods to select study participants and used different reference standards. This means that CEUS scans may be more or less accurate than what the evidence suggests. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to 5 November 2021.
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
How Well Does Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Find Liver Cancer in People with Long-Term Liver Disease?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Liver cancer that starts in the liver is called hepatocellular carcinoma. It is the sixth most common cancer in the world. It is also the fourth leading cause of death from cancer. This type of cancer mostly happens in people who have long-term liver disease. Long-term liver disease means the liver has not worked well for more than six months.

**Why is finding liver cancer early important?**

When doctors find liver cancer early, they can help people in several ways. They may remove part of the liver through surgery. They may give the person a new liver through transplant. If the cancer is more advanced, doctors may use chemotherapy. If doctors miss the cancer, people will not get the right treatment. But if doctors say someone has cancer when they do not, people may get tests or treatment they do not need.

**What is contrast-enhanced ultrasound?**

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is also called CEUS. It is a test that uses sound waves to look inside the liver. Doctors inject a safe contrast agent into the blood. This helps them see the liver better. The test can find areas in the liver that might be cancer. Doctors use CEUS when they think someone might have liver cancer based on other tests.

**Why was this study needed?**

Different medical guidelines disagree about using CEUS to find liver cancer. Past studies have shown different results about how well CEUS works. Researchers needed to review all the studies to see how accurate CEUS really is.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a single study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at many studies that had already been done. They searched for studies that tested how well CEUS finds liver cancer. They compared CEUS results to the best test available. The best test is looking at liver tissue under a microscope.

**Who was in the studies?**

The researchers found 23 studies. These studies included 6,546 adults total. All these adults had long-term liver disease. The studies looked at two groups. The first group had liver cancer of any size. The second group had liver cancer that doctors could remove with surgery.

**How long did the studies last?**

The length of time varied across the different studies. The researchers looked at studies published up to November 5, 2021.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers looked at what would happen if 1,000 people with long-term liver disease got a CEUS test. In this group, 690 people actually had liver cancer.

For liver cancer of any size:
- CEUS correctly found cancer in 537 people
- CEUS missed cancer in 153 people (about 22 out of 100 people with cancer)
- CEUS incorrectly said 19 people had cancer when they did not (about 6 out of 100 people without cancer)
- CEUS correctly showed no cancer in 291 people

For liver cancer that could be removed by surgery:
- CEUS correctly found cancer in 535 people
- CEUS missed cancer in 155 people (about 23 out of 100 people with cancer)
- CEUS incorrectly said 23 people had cancer when they did not (about 7 out of 100 people without cancer)
- CEUS correctly showed no cancer in 287 people

**What does this mean?**

CEUS misses liver cancer in about 1 out of 5 people who have it. These people would not get the right treatment at the right time. CEUS also finds cancer in some people who do not have it. These people might get tests or treatment they do not need.

**How reliable are these results?**

The researchers have some concerns about the results. The studies used different ways to pick people. They also used different tests to confirm cancer. This means CEUS might work better or worse than these results show.

**What do the researchers conclude?**

CEUS can help find liver cancer, but it is not perfect. It misses cancer in some people and finds cancer in others who do not have it. Doctors should know about these limitations when using CEUS."
10.1002-14651858.CD013485.pub2-pls.txt,"What are the benefits of supervised programmes of exercise and education (known as pulmonary rehabilitation) compared with usual care for adults with asthma? 
Key messages  
‐ We found that people with asthma who take part in supervised programmes of exercise and education (known as pulmonary rehabilitation) are likely to get fitter (can walk further) and have better wellbeing immediately after completing these programmes compared to those who receive usual care. However, we are not certain if these benefits persist up to one year later. 
‐ Due to a lack of evidence, the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation on outcomes such as rates of asthma attacks or hospitalisations, anxiety and depression, or physical activity levels is unclear.  
‐ Larger, well‐designed studies are needed to better estimate the true benefit of pulmonary rehabilitation for adults with asthma. 
What is asthma? 
Asthma is a common lung disease where the breathing tubes can become inflamed and narrowed and may produce extra mucus. People with asthma can experience cough, wheezing, chest tightness, and breathlessness, with those most severely affected experiencing difficulty going about their everyday lives.  
Asthma cannot be cured, but symptoms can be controlled. Different medications can help keep symptoms under control, whilst physical exercise can also help. However, some people with asthma may find it challenging to undertake comprehensive exercise programmes. 
What is pulmonary rehabilitation? 
Supervised programmes of exercise and education (called pulmonary rehabilitation) are commonly used for people with chronic lung conditions and help improve breathing, fitness, and wellbeing. These programmes may be based at hospitals, outpatient clinics, or even at home.  
Pulmonary rehabilitation is a recommended standard of care for many chronic lung conditions; however, its effects in adults with asthma are less clear. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to see how pulmonary rehabilitation affects physical fitness, control of asthma symptoms, and wellbeing of adults with asthma compared to usual clinical care involving no pulmonary rehabilitation. We also wanted to learn how it affects the rate of severe asthma attacks/hospitalisations, mental health (anxiety and depression), muscle strength, physical activity levels, and markers of inflammation (in sputum or blood). Finally, we wanted to see whether it is associated with any unwanted effects.  
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared pulmonary rehabilitation to usual care in adults with asthma. Treatment must have lasted at least four weeks (or eight or more sessions) and must have included aerobic exercises (such as walking or cycling) and education or self‐management.  
We compared and summarised findings across all eligible studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and size. 
What did we find? 
‐ We found 10 studies involving 894 adults with asthma. 
‐ The studies ranged in size from 24 to 412 people. 
‐ Most studies were conducted in Europe. 
‐ Where reported, most study participants were female, with the average age ranging from 27 to 54 years.  
‐ One study specifically included people with severe forms of asthma. Another study specifically included people who had a condition involving overlapping features of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
‐ The way pulmonary rehabilitation was delivered varied across studies. Inpatient programmes lasted 3 to 4 weeks, whilst outpatient programmes lasted 8 to 12 weeks. 
‐ The specific nature of exercise or education components amongst the included studies varied widely. 
Main results 
‐ Pulmonary rehabilitation probably causes a large increase in physical fitness immediately after completion of the programme, resulting in an ability to walk an average of 80 metres further in 6 minutes than in people who receive usual care. There may be little to no effect on physical fitness measured up to one year later. 
‐ Pulmonary rehabilitation may result in small improvements in or little to no impact on asthma control immediately after completion of the programme or up to one year later compared to usual care.  
‐ Pulmonary rehabilitation probably causes a large improvement in wellbeing as measured by the St George’s Respiratory Disease Questionnaire immediately after completion of the programme. Results may differ slightly according to different quality of life instruments. The effects potentially last up to one year, but results are very uncertain. 
‐ Little to no effect on wellbeing was observed after programme completion or up to nine months follow‐up when the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire was used.  
‐ There was very limited evidence to determine the effect of pulmonary rehabilitation on rates of asthma attacks/hospitalisations, measures of anxiety and depression, limb muscle strength, levels of physical activity, or markers of inflammation in the blood or sputum.  
‐ Data from one study suggested pulmonary rehabilitation resulted in no direct unwanted or harmful effects. 
Limitations of the evidence  
Our confidence in the evidence relating to outcomes such as physical fitness, wellbeing, and asthma control is limited due to concerns regarding unclear methods in some studies, the potential for participants or assessors (or both) to have influenced outcomes due to the awareness of assigned treatments, and the varied ways in which pulmonary rehabilitation was delivered. 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to May 2021.
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Can Exercise and Education Programs Help Adults with Asthma?

## Rationale

### What is asthma and why is it a problem?
Asthma is a common lung disease. The breathing tubes in the lungs can swell up and get narrow. They may also make extra mucus. People with asthma may cough, wheeze, feel chest tightness, and have trouble breathing. Some people with severe asthma find it hard to do daily tasks.

Asthma cannot be cured. But symptoms can be controlled. Medicines help keep symptoms under control. Exercise can also help. But some people with asthma find it hard to do full exercise programs.

### What is pulmonary rehabilitation?
Pulmonary rehabilitation is a program that combines exercise and education. A trained team supervises these programs. They are often used for people with long-term lung problems. These programs help improve breathing, fitness, and overall health. Programs can take place in hospitals, clinics, or at home.

Doctors recommend pulmonary rehabilitation for many lung diseases. But we do not know enough about how well it works for adults with asthma.

### Why was this study needed?
Researchers wanted to find out if pulmonary rehabilitation helps adults with asthma. They wanted to see if it improves fitness, asthma control, and quality of life. They also wanted to know if it affects asthma attacks, hospital stays, mental health, muscle strength, and activity levels. Finally, they wanted to check if it causes any harm.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was a review of existing studies. Researchers looked for studies that compared pulmonary rehabilitation to usual care in adults with asthma.

To be included, programs had to:
- Last at least 4 weeks (or 8 sessions or more)
- Include aerobic exercise (like walking or cycling)
- Include education or self-management training

### Who was in the studies?
The review included 10 studies. These studies involved 894 adults with asthma. Study sizes ranged from 24 to 412 people. Most studies took place in Europe. Most participants were women. Average ages ranged from 27 to 54 years.

One study focused on people with severe asthma. Another study included people with features of both asthma and another lung disease called COPD.

### How long did the programs last?
Program length varied:
- Hospital-based programs lasted 3 to 4 weeks
- Outpatient programs lasted 8 to 12 weeks

The types of exercise and education also varied across studies.

## Results

### What were the main results?

**Physical Fitness:**
Right after finishing the program, people could walk about 80 meters farther in 6 minutes. This is a large improvement. But we are not sure if this benefit lasts up to one year later.

**Asthma Control:**
Pulmonary rehabilitation may cause small improvements in asthma control. Or it may have little to no effect. This was true both right after the program and up to one year later.

**Quality of Life:**
One measure showed large improvements in wellbeing right after the program. But another measure showed little to no improvement. We are very uncertain if benefits last up to one year.

**Other Outcomes:**
There was not enough evidence to know if pulmonary rehabilitation affects:
- Asthma attacks or hospital stays
- Anxiety and depression
- Muscle strength
- Physical activity levels
- Inflammation markers in blood or sputum

**Safety:**
One study found no harmful effects from pulmonary rehabilitation.

### What do these results mean?
Adults with asthma who complete pulmonary rehabilitation programs likely get fitter. They can walk farther. They may also feel better overall. These benefits happen right after finishing the program.

However, we do not know if these benefits last long-term. We also need more information about other important outcomes.

### What is needed next?
Larger and better-designed studies are needed. These will help us understand the true benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation for adults with asthma.

### Limitations
Our confidence in these results is limited. Some studies had unclear methods. People in the studies knew which treatment they received. This may have affected results. Also, programs varied widely across studies.

This review includes evidence up to May 2021."
10.1002-14651858.CD013487-pls.txt,"Multiple drug combinations of bortezomib, lenalidomide and thalidomide for initial treatment of adults with transplant‐ineligible multiple myeloma 
Background 
Multiple myeloma is a type of blood cancer. It accounts for approximately 2% of all cancers and is still considered incurable. For people with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM), who are unsuitable for a procedure where damaged blood cells are replaced with healthy ones (stem‐cell transplant), treatment is usually a multiple drug combination of bortezomib, lenalidomide, or thalidomide, plus melphalan and prednisolone (MP) or dexamethasone (D). Multiple drug combinations are approved for initial anti‐myeloma therapy, however, access to these medicines is restricted in many countries worldwide. 
Aim of the review 
To compare the benefits and harms of selected anti‐myeloma drugs (bortezomib (V), lenalidomide (R), thalidomide (T)) for transplant‐unsuitable NDMM. 
Study characteristics 
We searched selected medical databases and trial registries until 14th February 2019. We included studies comparing multiple drug combinations of V, R, and T for the treatment of people with NDMM who were unsuitable for a stem‐cell transplant. We differentiated between fixed treatment duration and continuous therapy. Fixed therapy is a pre‐specified number of cycles, while a continuous therapy is given until the disease gets worse, the person finds the drug hard to tolerate, or when the treatment is given for a prolonged period. Continuous therapies are indicated with a ""c"". 
Key results 
We identified 25 studies involving 11,403 transplant‐unsuitable adults with NDMM, and comparing 21 different treatment regimens. 
Survival 
People who had the standard treatment, MP, lived for an average of 35 months. People treated with RD, TMP, and VRDc probably live for much longer (moderate certainty). Treatment with VMP may also lead to much longer survival, compared to MP (low certainty). People treated with RD lived for an additional 20.4 months; with TMP an additional 11.6 months; with VRDc an additional 36.2 months, and with VMP an additional 14.9 months. 
Harms 
On average, 0.9% (9 out of 1000) of people treated with MP experienced peripheral nerve damage (polyneuropathies).The evidence was inconclusive whether treatment with RD decreases the risk of developing a polyneuropathy, compared to MP. The estimated risk of polyneuropathies with RD was 0.5%. Treatment with TMP and VMP probably increases the risk of experiencing polyneuropathies compared to MP (moderate certainty). The estimated risk with TMP was 4.0%, and with VMP 79.4%. No VRDc treatment study reported the number of participants with severe polyneuropathies. 
On average, 36.1% (361 out of 1000) of people on MP‐treatment experienced at least one serious adverse event (SAE). VMP probably increases the proportion of participants with SAEs compared to MP to 46.2% (moderate certainty). 
On average, 9.2% (92 out of 1000) of people treated with MP stop the treatment because of adverse events (AEs). Treatment with RD, TMP, and VRDc leads to a much higher proportion of people stopping treatment because of AEs than MP (high certainty). The risk of stopping treatment with RD is 38.5%; with TMP 37.7%, with VRDc 82.1%. Treatment with VMP probably increases the risk of stopping treatment because of AEs compared to MP (9.75%, moderate certainty). 
Quality of life 
Quality of life (QoL) was reported in four studies for seven different treatments and was measured with four different tools. Assessment and reporting differed between studies and could not be meta‐analysed. However, all studies reported an improvement in QoL after anti‐myeloma treatment was started for all assessed treatments. 
Conclusions 
VRDc showed the highest overall survival benefits, compared to MP. RD and TMP also improved OS compared to MP. However, these combinations of drugs also led to more adverse events compared to MP, and led to more people stopping treatment. More trials are needed that look carefully at both harms and QoL. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Drug Combinations for Older Adults with Multiple Myeloma Who Cannot Have a Stem Cell Transplant

## Plain Title

Comparing different drug mixes to treat older adults with a new diagnosis of multiple myeloma who cannot have a stem cell transplant.

## Rationale

**What is multiple myeloma?**

Multiple myeloma is a type of blood cancer. It affects about 2 out of every 100 people who get cancer. Right now, doctors cannot cure this disease, but they can treat it.

**Who was this study for?**

Some people with multiple myeloma cannot have a stem cell transplant. A stem cell transplant is a procedure where doctors replace damaged blood cells with healthy ones. People who cannot have this procedure need other treatments.

**What treatments are available?**

Doctors use different drug mixes to treat these patients. The drugs include:
- Bortezomib (we call it ""V"")
- Lenalidomide (we call it ""R"")
- Thalidomide (we call it ""T"")
- Melphalan and prednisolone (we call this ""MP"")
- Dexamethasone (we call it ""D"")

Doctors can mix these drugs in different ways. The standard treatment is MP.

**Why was this study needed?**

Many drug mixes are approved for treatment. But many countries do not allow patients to use all of them. Researchers wanted to find out which drug mixes work best and which ones cause the most problems.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 25 studies. These studies included 11,403 adults with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. All of these people could not have a stem cell transplant.

The studies compared 21 different drug mixes. Some treatments were given for a set number of cycles. Other treatments were given continuously until the disease got worse or the person could not tolerate the drugs anymore. We mark continuous treatments with a ""c"" after the name.

Researchers searched medical databases until February 14, 2019. They looked for studies that compared different mixes of V, R, and T drugs.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

**How long did people live?**

People who got the standard treatment (MP) lived for about 35 months on average.

Other treatments helped people live longer:
- RD: People lived about 20 extra months (55 months total)
- TMP: People lived about 12 extra months (47 months total)
- VRDc: People lived about 36 extra months (71 months total)
- VMP: People lived about 15 extra months (50 months total)

VRDc helped people live the longest.

**What problems did the treatments cause?**

**Nerve damage:**

About 9 out of 1,000 people on MP got nerve damage. Nerve damage can cause pain, tingling, or numbness.

- RD: About 5 out of 1,000 people got nerve damage
- TMP: About 40 out of 1,000 people got nerve damage
- VMP: About 794 out of 1,000 people got nerve damage
- VRDc: Studies did not report this information

**Serious side effects:**

About 361 out of 1,000 people on MP had at least one serious side effect.

- VMP: About 462 out of 1,000 people had serious side effects

**Stopping treatment:**

About 92 out of 1,000 people on MP stopped treatment because of side effects.

More people stopped treatment with other drug mixes:
- RD: About 385 out of 1,000 people stopped
- TMP: About 377 out of 1,000 people stopped
- VRDc: About 821 out of 1,000 people stopped
- VMP: About 98 out of 1,000 people stopped

**Quality of life:**

Four studies looked at quality of life. They used different tools to measure it. All studies found that quality of life got better after people started treatment. This was true for all drug mixes tested.

**What do these results mean?**

VRDc helped people live the longest compared to MP. RD and TMP also helped people live longer than MP. But these drug mixes also caused more side effects. More people had to stop treatment because of these side effects.

**What is needed next?**

More studies are needed. These studies should carefully look at both the harms and quality of life for patients."
10.1002-14651858.CD013488.pub2-pls.txt,"Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy timings in cystic fibrosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the different timings of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) in people (of any age) with cystic fibrosis (CF). 
Background 
CF is an inherited condition affecting over 70,000 individuals worldwide. Between 80% and 90% of people with CF are not able to produce enough pancreatic enzymes to breakdown and absorb fat, protein and fat‐soluble vitamins from food. This can lead to fatty stools (poo) and weight loss. It is thought that if fat is not digested properly, it could contribute to a higher risk of developing constipation or other serious gut complications such as distal intestinal obstruction syndrome. 
PERT provides the enzymes required to breakdown fat and the dosage is based upon the fat content of a meal or the person's body weight. PERT has been shown to improve weight and is associated with improved lung function. Despite current dose guidance, there are differences in PERT doses and there is no set guidance for when the therapy should be taken in relation to a meal (i.e. before, during or after eating). 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 24 June 2021.
Study characteristics 
We did not find any studies where PERT was given to people with CF who were pancreatic insufficient at different timings relative to their meals. We excluded nine studies. Four of these assessed the timing of PERT administration, but they had a cross‐over design where participants had one intervention and then swapped to the second intervention. We excluded these studies because they did not leave enough time between the different interventions to be sure that the effects of the first intervention were not affecting the results from the second intervention. Four studies did not look at the timing of PERT and one study evaluated a new educational program for PERT. One study was terminated early and we will assess this again at the first update of this review if we are able to obtain more information from the investigators. 
Key results 
No studies met the eligibility criteria. Further research is needed to work out the best time to take PERT in relation to a meal. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
A review looking at the best time to take pancreas enzymes with meals for people with cystic fibrosis

## Rationale

### What is cystic fibrosis and why is this important?

Cystic fibrosis is a disease that runs in families. It affects more than 70,000 people around the world. 

Most people with cystic fibrosis (8 to 9 out of 10 people) cannot make enough enzymes. Enzymes are special proteins that help break down food. Without enough enzymes, the body cannot break down and use fat, protein, and certain vitamins from food.

This causes problems like:
- Fatty stools (poo)
- Weight loss
- Blocked intestines (the tube that carries food through your body)
- Constipation (trouble going to the bathroom)

### Why was this study needed?

Doctors give people with cystic fibrosis pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, or PERT. PERT gives the body the enzymes it needs to break down food. The amount of PERT depends on how much fat is in the meal or how much the person weighs.

PERT helps people gain weight. It also helps their lungs work better.

Doctors know how much PERT to give. But they do not know the best time to take it. Should people take PERT before eating? During a meal? Or after eating?

The researchers wanted to find out the best time to take PERT with meals.

## Trial Design

### How did the researchers look for studies?

The researchers searched for studies up to June 24, 2021. They looked for studies that tested different times for taking PERT.

They wanted to find studies with:
- People of any age with cystic fibrosis
- People who could not make enough pancreas enzymes
- Different groups taking PERT at different times (before, during, or after meals)

### What did they find?

The researchers did not find any studies that met their needs.

They found nine studies, but none of them could be used:
- Four studies looked at PERT timing but had a problem with their design. People switched from one timing to another too quickly. This meant the first timing might still affect the results from the second timing.
- Four studies did not look at PERT timing at all.
- One study looked at a teaching program about PERT, not timing.
- One study stopped early. The researchers will check this study again later.

## Results

### What were the main results?

The researchers found no studies that could answer the question. They could not find out the best time to take ERT with meals.

### What does this mean?

More research is needed. Scientists need to do studies that test when people should take PERT. These studies should compare taking PERT before meals, during meals, and after meals.

Until more research is done, doctors and people with cystic fibrosis do not have clear guidance about the best time to take PERT.

### What happens next?

The researchers will keep looking for new studies. They hope future research will help answer this important question. This could help people with cystic fibrosis get the most benefit from their enzyme therapy."
10.1002-14651858.CD013489.pub2-pls.txt,"Medicine‐free treatment for stuttering in children aged six years and younger
What was the aim of this review? 
The aim of this review was to find out if medicine‐free treatment for stuttering can improve speech fluency, children's communication attitudes and the impact on the child's quality of life, and potential harmful effects in children aged six years and younger, both in the short‐ and long‐term. We collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer this question and found four studies. 
Key messages 
The Lidcombe Program may result in lower stuttering frequency and higher speech efficiency (i.e. number of words or syllables spoken per minute) for young children after receiving the amount of treatment included in the studies. We do not yet know the impact of the programme delivered in its entirety, as no study reported outcomes for children who had completed the programme, which is designed to last for one to two years. 
Only one study reported how treatment worked in the long run, but the effect of treatment could not be summarized, as the results for most children in the control group were missing. 
We require more high‐quality studies assessing stuttering treatments for young children, including studies that report on a broader range of outcomes and that assess treatments other than the Lidcombe Program. 
What did the review study? 
Stuttering, or stammering as it is sometimes called, is a common communication disorder, that usually begins when children are between two and four years of age. Stuttering can be characterized by repetitions of individual speech sounds, parts of words or whole words; involuntary lengthening of speech sounds; or speech blockages. Moments of stuttering can also be accompanied by visible tension in the speaker's face or voice, eye blinks or head nods. Stuttering can have a negative effect on how people feel about themselves and how they live their lives. Therefore, it is important to identify effective treatments for stuttering in young children to reduce the chance that they will experience these negative effects. 
What were the main results of the review?  
We found four studies, all of which compared young children who received the Lidcombe Program to young children on a wait‐list. In three studies, the children on the wait‐list did not receive any treatment until after the study was finished. In the fourth, the children on the wait‐list could receive treatment from their local speech language therapist (SLT) if they wanted to. At the end of the study, parents of seven children (35%) in the control group reported their child had received some treatment, either the Lidcombe Program or another treatment programme called ""Easy Does It"", while on the wait‐list. 
There were 151 children aged between two and six years in the four studies. In the Lidcombe Program, an SLT conducted clinic visits with the child and parent in person in a clinic or spoke to them by telephone. During these visits, parents were taught to conduct treatment at home during 10‐ to 15‐minute daily practice sessions. Two studies were conducted in Australia, one in New Zealand and one in Germany. Two studies were conducted for nine months, one for 16 weeks and one for 12 weeks. One study was partially funded by the Rotary Club, Wiesbaden, Germany; and one was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia. One study did not report any funding sources and another reported that they did not receive any funding for the trial. 
All four studies reported the effects of treatment on stuttering frequency. One study also reported on speech efficiency. We found no studies that looked at the effects of treatments for stuttering on stuttering severity; communication attitudes; emotional (how a child recognizes, expresses, and manages feelings), cognitive (how a child thinks, explores and works problems out) or psychosocial (how a child's individual needs link to the needs or demands of society) development; or side effects. 
The included studies suggest that the Lidcombe Program may reduce stuttering frequency in young children compared to a wait‐list control group (very low‐quality evidence). One study also reported that the Lidcombe Program may increase speech efficiency in young children compared to a wait‐list control group (moderate‐quality evidence). 
Only one study followed the children up to five years after treatment started, and at that time the results for most of the children in the control group were missing. Therefore, we do not know if the benefits of the treatment lasted over time. 
How up‐to‐date was this review? 
We searched for studies that had been published up to 16 September 2020. One additional database was searched on 20 October 2020.  
How reliable was the evidence generated by this review? 
The quality of the results related to stuttering frequency was very low and the results related to speech efficiency was moderate. This means that we are uncertain that the treatment effect would stay the same if we added more studies to the review. More studies comparing different treatments for stuttering to a wait‐list control group are needed to know the effect of treatment for stuttering with greater certainty. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Treatment Without Medicine for Stuttering in Young Children

## Plain Title
Can treatment without medicine help young children who stutter speak more smoothly?

## Rationale

### What is stuttering?
Stuttering is a speech problem that usually starts when children are 2 to 4 years old. Children who stutter may:
- Repeat sounds, parts of words, or whole words
- Stretch out sounds longer than normal
- Get stuck and cannot make sounds come out
- Show tight muscles in their face
- Blink their eyes or nod their heads while trying to talk

### Why does this matter?
Stuttering can make children feel bad about themselves. It can affect how they live their lives. Finding good treatments for young children who stutter is important. Early treatment may help stop these problems before they start.

### What did researchers want to learn?
Researchers wanted to know if treatment without medicine could help young children who stutter. They looked for answers to these questions:
- Does treatment help children speak more smoothly?
- Does treatment help children feel better about talking?
- Does treatment improve children's quality of life?
- Does treatment cause any harm?

They wanted to know if treatment helps right away. They also wanted to know if it helps over time.

## Trial Design

### How did researchers study this?
Researchers looked for all studies about stuttering treatment in young children. They found 4 studies that met their needs.

### Who was in the studies?
All 4 studies included 151 children total. The children were 2 to 6 years old. All children stuttered when they talked.

### What treatment did children get?
All 4 studies tested a program called the Lidcombe Program. In this program:
- A speech therapist met with the child and parent
- Meetings happened in a clinic or by phone
- Parents learned how to help their child at home
- Parents practiced with their child for 10 to 15 minutes each day

### What did researchers compare?
Researchers compared two groups:
- Children who got the Lidcombe Program right away
- Children who waited to get treatment (wait-list group)

In 3 studies, children on the wait-list got no treatment during the study. In 1 study, some children on the wait-list got treatment if they wanted it.

### Where did the studies happen?
- 2 studies were in Australia
- 1 study was in New Zealand
- 1 study was in Germany

### How long did the studies last?
- 2 studies lasted 9 months
- 1 study lasted 16 weeks (about 4 months)
- 1 study lasted 12 weeks (about 3 months)

## Results

### What did researchers find?
The Lidcombe Program may help young children stutter less often. Children who got the program stuttered less than children on the wait-list.

One study also found that children in the program could speak more words per minute. This means they could talk more easily.

### What did researchers NOT find?
Researchers found no studies that looked at:
- How bad the stuttering was
- How children felt about talking
- How treatment affected children's feelings
- How treatment affected children's thinking
- How treatment affected children's social life
- Whether treatment caused any harm

### Did the treatment keep working over time?
Only 1 study checked on children years later. This study looked at children 5 years after treatment started. But most children in the wait-list group had dropped out. Researchers could not tell if treatment kept working over time.

### Important things to know
The studies only looked at part of the Lidcombe Program. The full program is meant to last 1 to 2 years. No study followed children through the whole program.

### How sure are we about these results?
Researchers are not very sure about the results. The quality of evidence was very low for stuttering frequency. The quality was moderate for speech efficiency. This means we need more studies to be more certain.

### What do we still need to learn?
We need more high-quality studies that:
- Test different treatments for stuttering
- Look at more outcomes (like how children feel)
- Follow children for longer periods of time
- Include children who finish the full treatment program

### Bottom line
The Lidcombe Program may help young children stutter less. It may help them speak more easily. But we need more research to know for sure. We also need to know if the benefits last over time."
10.1002-14651858.CD013491.pub2-pls.txt,"Predicting relapse or recurrence of depression
What is the aim of this review? 
Relapse and recurrence (becoming unwell again after making an improvement) are common in depression and lead to increased disability and decreased quality of life for patients. Relapse is a re‐emergence of the initial episode of depression after some initial improvement, whereas recurrence is the onset of a new episode of depression after recovery. Outcomes, such as relapse and recurrence, can sometimes be predicted while people are well, using information available at the time. A mathematical calculation can be performed to assess an individual person's risk; this calculation is known as a 'prognostic model' or a prediction tool. In most health services, including the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK, resources such as doctors and therapists need to be used in the best way possible, for the people who will gain the most benefit from them. If accurate prediction tools are available, the information can be used to identify the most 'high risk' patients and make sure they receive additional support to try to prevent a relapse or a recurrence. 
The aim of this review was to identify studies that have attempted to develop a prediction tool for relapse or recurrence of depression in adults. We were interested in studies that had attempted to make this prediction while patients were well. We also included tools that predicted the chance of patients staying well. If we had found multiple studies that tested the same prediction tool, we planned to combine these to work out a better summary of how well that tool worked. 
Key messages 
We identified 10 prediction tools (over 11 studies) for relapse or recurrence. These were either not proven to be good at predicting relapse/recurrence, or the studies had problems with how they were carried out, meaning that none of the prediction tools were at a stage where they could be used in the real world. Further work is needed to improve prediction of relapse or recurrence of depression. 
What was studied in the review? 
We collected and analysed the results of 11 relevant studies. We were interested in several things: how researchers had defined relapse and recurrence (for example, whether they had used clinical interviews or self‐report questionnaires to diagnose depressive symptoms); what information was gathered to help make predictions; the techniques used by the researchers to help develop the tools; and how well the tools predicted. We were also interested in whether the tools were tested in a separate group of participants, which is essential to ensure that the model can predict accurately in patients in the real world. 
Finally, we assessed the studies to determine how confident we could be in the results, given the approaches taken by researchers (this is called 'risk of bias') and how relevant the studies were to our review (this is called 'applicability'). 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found 11 studies. Ten of these developed different models and one study tested one of the models developed in a previous study. It was not possible to combine results for any particular tool. 
Ten of the 11 studies were rated at high risk of bias. This means that we cannot be confident in the results that were presented, due to some issues with the way the studies were conducted. The most common issue was that there were not enough participants included in the studies. Other common problems involved the statistical approaches used by the researchers. 
One study was at low overall risk of bias, which means that we can be more confident in trusting the results. However, this tool did not make accurate predictions about relapse or recurrence. 
We found no studies that could be used in clinical practice; further work is needed to develop tools for predicting relapse or recurrence of depression. 
How up‐to‐date is the review? 
The literature search for this review was completed in May 2020.
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Can Doctors Predict When Depression Will Come Back After People Get Better?

## Rationale

**What is depression and why does it matter?**

Depression is a common mental health problem. Many people with depression get better with treatment. But depression often comes back after people feel better. This makes life harder for patients. It lowers their quality of life.

**What happens when depression comes back?**

When depression returns, it can happen in two ways. Relapse means the same episode of depression comes back after a person starts to feel better. Recurrence means a completely new episode of depression starts after a person has fully recovered.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Doctors want to know which patients are most likely to get depressed again. If doctors could predict this, they could give extra help to those patients. This might stop depression from coming back. Doctors could use their time and resources to help the people who need it most.

**What are prediction tools?**

Prediction tools use math to calculate a person's risk. They use information about the patient to make predictions. These tools could help doctors identify high-risk patients while they are still feeling well.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to find studies that created prediction tools. These tools would predict if depression would come back in adults. They looked for tools that make predictions while patients are feeling well.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers do this review?**

This was not a single study. Instead, researchers collected and reviewed many studies. They looked at 11 studies that tried to create or test prediction tools.

**What did researchers look at in these studies?**

Researchers examined several things. They looked at how each study defined relapse and recurrence. They checked what information was collected from patients. They reviewed the methods used to build the tools. They also checked if the tools were tested on new groups of patients. This testing is important. It shows if tools work in the real world.

**How did researchers judge the quality of studies?**

Researchers checked each study carefully. They looked for problems in how studies were done. This is called checking for ""risk of bias."" They also checked if the studies were relevant to their review question.

**When was this review done?**

Researchers searched for studies up to May 2020.

## Results

**What did researchers find?**

Researchers found 11 studies. Ten studies created new prediction tools. One study tested a tool from an earlier study. Each study used a different tool. Researchers could not combine results from different studies.

**Did the prediction tools work well?**

The tools did not work well enough to use in real life. Ten out of 11 studies had serious problems. These problems mean we cannot trust their results.

**What problems did the studies have?**

The most common problem was too few patients in the studies. Other problems involved the math methods researchers used. These problems made the results unreliable.

**Was there any good news?**

One study was done well. We can trust how this study was done. But even this tool could not accurately predict when depression would come back.

**What does this mean for patients?**

Right now, there are no prediction tools ready for doctors to use. None of the tools found in this review work well enough. Doctors cannot yet predict which patients will get depressed again.

**What happens next?**

More research is needed. Scientists need to create better tools. These tools must be tested properly. They need to include enough patients. They must use good methods. Only then can doctors use them to help patients.

**Why is this important?**

Better prediction tools could help doctors prevent depression from coming back. They could give extra support to patients who need it most. This could improve life for people with depression."
10.1002-14651858.CD013495.pub2-pls.txt,"Stopping long‐term antidepressants in people with depression or anxiety
Review question 
We aimed to find out if it is effective and safe to stop antidepressants for people with depression or anxiety who have been taking them for six months or longer. 
We compared different approaches for stopping long‐term antidepressants versus continuation. We looked at benefits (e.g. successful discontinuation rate) and harms, such as return of the depressive or anxiety episode (relapse), side effects, and withdrawal symptoms (i.e. symptoms people experience when stopping an antidepressant). 
Background 
Antidepressants are widely used for depression and anxiety. Guidelines recommend that an antidepressant should be continued for at least six months after people start to feel better, and for at least two years if they have had two or more periods of depression. Many people take antidepressants for much longer, and as they can cause unpleasant side effects, long‐term use puts people at risk of harm that may outweigh the benefits. 
Study characteristics 
Our search up until January 2020 found 33 studies, which included 4995 adult participants. Most people in these studies had recurrent depression (two or more episodes of depression before stopping antidepressants), and most were recruited from specialist mental healthcare services. In 13 studies, the antidepressant was stopped abruptly; in 18 studies, the antidepressant was stopped gradually over several weeks (""tapering""); in four studies, psychological therapy support was also offered; and in one study, stopping was prompted by a letter to the GP with guidance on tapering. Most tapering schemes lasted four weeks or less. 
Key results 
We found very low‐certainty evidence suggesting that abrupt stopping may lead to higher risk of relapse and there was insufficient evidence of its effect on occurrence of side effects compared to continuation of the antidepressant. 
We found very low‐certainty evidence suggesting that ""tapering"" over a few weeks may lead to higher risk of a return and again may have little or no effect on side effects compared to continuation. 
We found evidence of very low to low certainty to suggest that stopping the antidepressant in combination with providing preventive cognitive therapy (PCT), or MBCT, was possible for 40% to 75% of participants in the group tapering the antidepressant and may show no difference in effects on relapse. 
We found low‐certainty evidence suggesting that a prompt letter and guidance on tapering sent to the GP may have no effect on the number of people who stop their antidepressant. 
We were unable to draw conclusions about withdrawal symptoms after abrupt or gradual stopping of an antidepressant, as this generally was not assessed. 
None of the studies used very slow tapering schemes beyond a few weeks, tapered liquid forms of antidepressants, or used tapering strips (to allow tapering with very low doses). 
None of the identified studies investigated stopping combined with providing supportive therapy such as online support or self‐help therapy. 
Certainty of evidence 
Overall, the certainty of evidence was low to very low. This means we have limited or little confidence in the results, and new research is likely to change our conclusions. The main reasons for this assessment of evidence certainty were that trials did not distinguish between symptoms of relapse of depression and symptoms of withdrawal. Also, most studies used no tapering or very ""rapid"" tapering schedules (four weeks or less), and nearly all studies included people with recurrent depression (more than two episodes). 
Conclusions 
We found few studies that examined stopping long‐term antidepressants. We are uncertain if the approaches for stopping long‐term antidepressants studied to date are effective and safe in people with recurrent depression. People should discuss with their doctor when they want to stop their antidepressant. 
Future studies should include people in primary care with only one or no earlier episodes of depression, older people, and people taking antidepressants for anxiety. Studies should taper antidepressants slowly while taking care to distinguish withdrawal symptoms from relapse.

Depression and anxiety are common mental health problems. They can make people feel very sad, worried, or unable to enjoy life. These conditions can make it hard to work, spend time with family, or do daily tasks.

**What are antidepressants?**
Antidepressants are medicines that help treat depression and anxiety. Many people take these medicines for a long time. Doctors usually say people should keep taking them for at least 6 months after feeling better. Some people need to take them for 2 years or longer.

**Why is this study needed?**
Many people take antidepressants for much longer than recommended. These medicines can cause unwanted effects that bother people. When people take them for a very long time, the bad effects might be worse than the good effects. Researchers wanted to find out if people can safely stop taking these medicines. They also wanted to know the best way to stop them.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Researchers wanted to know if stopping antidepressants works well and is safe. They looked at different ways to stop the medicine. They checked if depression or anxiety came back. They also looked for side effects and withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms are problems people have when they stop taking a medicine.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**
This was a review study. Researchers looked at 33 different studies that other scientists had done. They gathered information from all these studies together.

**Who was in the studies?**
The studies included 4,995 adults. Most of these people had depression that came back more than once. This means they had two or more times when they felt depressed. Most people in the studies were getting care from mental health specialists.

**What did the studies test?**
The studies tested different ways to stop antidepressants:
- 13 studies stopped the medicine suddenly
- 18 studies stopped the medicine slowly over several weeks (called ""tapering"")
- 4 studies also gave people therapy to help them
- 1 study sent a letter to doctors with advice about stopping slowly

Most studies that stopped medicine slowly did it in 4 weeks or less.

**When was this research done?**
Researchers looked at all studies published up to January 2020.

## Results

**What did researchers find?**

**Stopping suddenly:**
Stopping the medicine all at once may cause depression to come back more often. Researchers are not sure about this finding. They need more studies to be certain.

**Stopping slowly over a few weeks:**
Stopping the medicine slowly over a few weeks may also cause depression to come back more often. This approach may not reduce side effects compared to staying on the medicine. Again, researchers are not very sure about these findings.

**Stopping with therapy support:**
Some studies gave people special therapy while stopping their medicine. The therapy types were called PCT or MBCT. These helped 40 to 75 people out of every 100 stop their medicine successfully. Depression may not come back more often with this approach.

**Sending advice to doctors:**
Sending letters to doctors with stopping advice may not help more people stop their medicine.

**What about withdrawal symptoms?**
Most studies did not check for withdrawal symptoms. Researchers could not tell if people had these problems when stopping.

**What was missing from the studies?**
- No studies stopped medicine very slowly over many months
- No studies used liquid forms of medicine for easier stopping
- No studies used special tools to take very tiny doses
- No studies tested online support or self-help during stopping

**How sure are we about these results?**
The researchers have low confidence in these findings. This means new studies might show different results. The main problems were:
- Studies could not tell the difference between depression coming back and withdrawal symptoms
- Most studies stopped medicine too quickly
- Most studies only included people who had depression many times before

**What do these results mean?**
We do not have enough good information about stopping long-term antidepressants safely. People who want to stop their medicine should talk with their doctor first. They should make a plan together.

**What research is needed next?**
Future studies should include:
- People seeing regular doctors, not just specialists
- People who had depression only once or never before
- Older people
- People taking medicine for anxiety
- Very slow stopping schedules
- Better ways to tell withdrawal symptoms from depression coming back"
10.1002-14651858.CD013497.pub2-pls.txt,"Growth factor‐supplemented culture media for women undergoing assisted reproduction
Review question 
Does culture media containing the growth factor GM‐CSF (granulocyte macrophage colony‐stimulating factor) improve the chances of a pregnancy and live‐born baby, and reduce the risk of miscarriage, twin or triplet pregnancy, premature birth, birth defects, genetic problems in the baby, and stillbirth? 
Background 
Assisted reproduction includes processes whereby a woman's eggs and a man's sperm are combined to achieve fertilisation outside of the body. Embryos are placed in a solution called culture medium to support the growing embryo until it can be replaced into the woman's uterus. Culture medium supplemented with GM‐CSF is widely available in clinics and is often offered as an 'add‐on' to an in vitro fertilisation (IVF) cycle in an effort to improve the success rates of treatment. Using GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture medium can make IVF more expensive. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to October 2019. We obtained data from three randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) of 1532 infertile women undergoing IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), a specialised form of IVF whereby the sperm is injected into the egg. We compared GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media versus culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF for those undergoing assisted reproduction. 
What the review found 
Low‐quality evidence reveals that we are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐containing culture media makes any difference to the live‐birth rate when compared to using culture media not containing GM‐CSF. This suggests that if the rate of live birth associated with culture media not containing GM‐CSF is 22%, the rate with the use of GM‐CSF‐containing culture media would be between 21% and 30%. Low‐quality evidence also reveals that we are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐containing culture media makes any difference to miscarriage when compared to using culture media not containing GM‐CSF. This suggests that if the miscarriage rate associated with culture media not containing GM‐CSF is 4%, the rate with the use of GM‐CSF‐containing culture media would be between 2% and 5%. Low‐quality evidence for pregnancy, birth defects, and genetic problems with the baby, and very low‐quality evidence for twin or triplet pregnancies, and premature birth, reveals that we are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐containing culture media makes any difference to these outcomes when compared to culture media not containing GM‐CSF. Two studies looked at stillbirth, but as no stillbirths occurred in either study, we were unable to analyse this outcome. 
Overall conclusions 
Due to the very low to low quality of the evidence, we cannot be certain whether GM‐CSF is any more or less effective or harmful than culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF. It is important that independent information on the available evidence is made accessible to those considering using GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media. In the meantime, more large studies are needed to increase the certainty of our conclusions. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Growth Factor-Supplemented Culture Media for Women Undergoing Assisted Reproduction

## Plain Title
Does Adding a Growth Factor Called GM-CSF to Embryo Culture Media Help Women Have Babies Through IVF?

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**
Some women cannot get pregnant naturally. They need help from doctors to have a baby. This is called infertility.

**What is IVF?**
IVF stands for in vitro fertilization. Doctors take eggs from a woman's body. They mix the eggs with sperm from a man outside the body. When an egg and sperm join, they make an embryo. The embryo is the start of a baby.

**What happens to the embryo?**
The embryo must grow for a few days before doctors put it into the woman's uterus (womb). During this time, the embryo sits in a special liquid. This liquid is called culture media. It feeds the embryo and helps it grow.

**What is GM-CSF?**
GM-CSF is a growth factor. Growth factors are natural substances that help cells grow. Some culture media have GM-CSF added to them. Doctors hope this extra ingredient helps embryos grow better.

**Why was this study needed?**
Many fertility clinics offer culture media with GM-CSF. They call it an ""add-on"" treatment. This means it costs extra money. But doctors did not know if it really helps women have babies. This study looked at the research to find out if GM-CSF works.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at three studies. These studies tested GM-CSF culture media. The studies were randomized controlled trials. This means women were put into groups by chance. Some women got culture media with GM-CSF. Other women got culture media without GM-CSF. Then researchers compared the results.

**Who was in the studies?**
A total of 1,532 women were in the three studies. All the women could not get pregnant on their own. They were getting IVF or ICSI treatment. ICSI is a special type of IVF. In ICSI, doctors inject one sperm directly into one egg.

**How long did the studies last?**
The studies followed women through their IVF treatment. They tracked what happened with pregnancies and births.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found that the evidence was low quality or very low quality. This means we cannot be sure about the results.

**Live births:**
Researchers are not sure if GM-CSF helps more babies be born alive. In women using regular culture media, about 22 out of 100 had a live birth. With GM-CSF media, between 21 and 30 out of 100 might have a live birth. The difference is too small to be certain.

**Miscarriage:**
Researchers are not sure if GM-CSF changes miscarriage rates. With regular media, about 4 out of 100 women had a miscarriage. With GM-CSF media, between 2 and 5 out of 100 might have a miscarriage.

**Other outcomes:**
Researchers looked at other things too:
- Getting pregnant
- Having twins or triplets
- Having a premature baby (born too early)
- Birth defects in the baby
- Genetic problems in the baby
- Stillbirth (baby dies before birth)

For all these outcomes, researchers are not sure if GM-CSF makes any difference. No stillbirths happened in the studies, so researchers could not study this outcome.

**What do these results mean?**

The evidence is not strong enough to know if GM-CSF works. It might help. It might not help. It might even cause harm. We simply do not know for sure.

**What should people do?**

Women thinking about using GM-CSF culture media should know the facts. The evidence does not clearly show it helps. It costs extra money. Women should talk with their doctors about whether it is right for them.

**What happens next?**

More large studies are needed. Better studies will help doctors know if GM-CSF really works. Until then, we cannot say for certain if it helps women have babies."
10.1002-14651858.CD013498.pub2-pls.txt,"Do people with type 1 diabetes mellitus benefit from using a different type of insulin as their basal insulin? 
Background 
Diabetes is a condition that causes a person's blood sugar (glucose) level to become too high. Insulin is a hormone that is released by the pancreas (a small organ behind the stomach) which controls the blood levels of glucose. In people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) the pancreas does not produce any insulin, so the person has to inject insulin to control the glucose levels and keep well. The goal of insulin therapy is to provide insulin that mimics physiologic insulin secretion. Insulin is given by an injection under the skin (subcutaneous) by means of insulin syringes, insulin pens or insulin pumps. In order to control blood glucose levels in periods of fasting, basal or background insulin is needed. Basal insulin can be given by means of daily or twice‐daily injections of an intermediate‐acting or (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin. Basal insulin can be given as intermediate‐acting human neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin or as (ultra‐)long‐acting analogue insulin (synthetic insulin). Bolus insulin is taken at mealtime (prandial insulin) to control blood glucose levels following a meal and is given by means of short‐acting or rapid‐acting insulin. The aim for most people with T1DM is to achieve near‐normal blood glucose levels to avoid long‐term complications such as kidney and eye disease and to allow flexibility regarding time, type and amount of food intake. The major unwanted effect of insulin therapy is hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) which can be severe. 
We wanted to find out whether one type of (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin compared with NPH insulin or another type of (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin is better for people with T1DM. The outcomes we were specifically interested in were death, health‐related quality of life, severe (night‐time) hypoglycaemia, serious unwanted events, non‐fatal complications of diabetes (heart attacks, strokes) and levels of glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) which is an indicator of long‐term glucose control. 
What did we look for? 
We searched medical databases and contacted pharmaceutical manufacturers and drug regulatory agencies for studies that:— were randomised controlled trials (medical studies where participants are put randomly into one of the treatment groups);— included people with T1DM;— compared one (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin with another (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin or NPH insulin;— lasted at least 24 weeks. 
What did we find?We found 26 studies including a total of 8780 participants (21% were children). The studies lasted between 24 weeks and two years. They compared:— NPH insulin with insulin detemir (nine studies);— NPH insulin with insulin glargine (nine studies);— Insulin detemir with insulin glargine (two studies);— Insulin degludec with insulin detemir (two studies);— Insulin degludec with insulin glargine (four studies). 
No study compared NPH insulin with insulin degludec.
Key results 
There were no clear differences for all main outcomes comparing (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin analogues with each other. 
Severe hypoglycaemic episodes were reduced with insulin detemir: among 1000 participants using NPH insulin, 115 would experience severe hypoglycaemia; using insulin detemir there would be 36 participants fewer (9 to 55 participants fewer) experiencing severe hypoglycaemia. However, the results were inconsistent, meaning if another study was performed there may not be a clear difference between insulin detemir and NPH insulin. There was no clear difference regarding the risk of severe night‐time hypoglycaemia. There were no clear differences for health‐related quality of life, serious unwanted effects or HbA1c levels. Very few people experienced a heart attack or died, and stroke was not reported. 
There were no clear differences comparing insulin glargine with NPH insulin for all main outcomes. Very few people experienced a heart attack, stroke or died. 
There were also no clear differences for all comparisons between children and adults.
Certainty of the evidence In the comparison of the insulin analogues detemir and glargine with NPH insulin, we are moderately confident about the results for death, severe (night‐time) hypoglycaemia, serious unwanted effects and HbA1c levels. We are uncertain about the effects on heart attacks, stroke and health‐related quality of life, mainly because there were only a few studies which did not last long enough to reliably investigate these outcomes. 
How up to date is this review?This evidence is up‐to‐date as of 24 August 2020. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Different Types of Long-Acting Insulin for People with Type 1 Diabetes

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Types of Long-Acting Insulin for People with Type 1 Diabetes

## Rationale

### What is Type 1 Diabetes?
Diabetes makes blood sugar levels too high. The body needs a hormone called insulin to control blood sugar. Insulin comes from an organ called the pancreas. In people with type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not make any insulin. These people must inject insulin every day to stay healthy.

### How Does Insulin Work?
People with type 1 diabetes need two types of insulin. Background insulin keeps blood sugar steady between meals and at night. Meal-time insulin controls blood sugar after eating. Background insulin can be given once or twice each day. It comes in different types: older NPH insulin or newer long-acting insulins.

### Why Was This Study Needed?
The goal is to keep blood sugar close to normal levels. This helps prevent serious health problems like kidney disease and eye disease. It also lets people eat more flexibly. However, insulin can cause blood sugar to drop too low. This is called low blood sugar and can be dangerous.

Researchers wanted to know which type of long-acting insulin works best. They looked at whether newer long-acting insulins work better than NPH insulin. They also compared different newer insulins to each other.

### What Did Researchers Want to Learn?
Researchers wanted to know about death rates, quality of life, and low blood sugar events. They also looked at serious side effects and heart problems. They measured long-term blood sugar control using a test called HbA1c.

## Trial Design

### How Was This Study Designed?
Researchers looked at 26 studies. These studies included 8,780 people total. About 1 in 5 people in the studies were children. The rest were adults.

The studies were randomized controlled trials. This means people were put into treatment groups by chance. This makes the results more reliable.

### What Did the Studies Compare?
The studies compared different types of long-acting insulin:
- 9 studies compared NPH insulin with insulin detemir
- 9 studies compared NPH insulin with insulin glargine
- 2 studies compared insulin detemir with insulin glargine
- 2 studies compared insulin degludec with insulin detemir
- 4 studies compared insulin degludec with insulin glargine

No studies compared NPH insulin with insulin degludec.

### How Long Did the Studies Last?
Each study lasted between 24 weeks and 2 years. This means people stayed in the studies for 6 months to 2 years.

## Results

### What Were the Main Findings?

#### Comparing Newer Long-Acting Insulins to Each Other
When researchers compared the newer long-acting insulins to each other, they found no clear differences. The insulins worked about the same for all important outcomes.

#### Comparing Insulin Detemir to NPH Insulin
Insulin detemir reduced severe low blood sugar events. Here is what this means: Out of 1,000 people using NPH insulin, 115 would have severe low blood sugar. With insulin detemir, 36 fewer people would have this problem. This means about 79 people out of 1,000 would have severe low blood sugar.

However, the results were not consistent across all studies. For low blood sugar at night, there was no clear difference. Quality of life, serious side effects, and long-term blood sugar control were similar. Very few people had heart attacks or died. No studies reported on strokes.

#### Comparing Insulin Glargine to NPH Insulin
There were no clear differences between insulin glargine and NPH insulin. All important outcomes were similar. Very few people had heart attacks, strokes, or died.

#### Comparing Children and Adults
The results were similar for both children and adults. No clear differences were found between age groups.

### How Reliable Are These Results?
Researchers are moderately confident about most results. This includes findings about death, low blood sugar, side effects, and blood sugar control. They are less certain about heart attacks, strokes, and quality of life. This is because few studies looked at these outcomes. The studies also did not last long enough to fully answer these questions.

### What Do These Results Mean?
For most people with type 1 diabetes, the different types of long-acting insulin work similarly. Insulin detemir may reduce severe low blood sugar compared to NPH insulin. However, this benefit is not certain. People should talk with their doctor about which insulin is best for them.

This review includes research up to August 24, 2020."
10.1002-14651858.CD013501.pub2-pls.txt,"Vegan diets for the prevention of cardiovascular disease
Background 
It is well known that diet plays a major role in cardiovascular disease risk. This review assesses the effects of providing dietary advice to follow a vegan diet (excluding all meat, fish, eggs, dairy and honey) or providing foods relevant to the diet (or both) to healthy adults, to people at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and to those with cardiovascular disease, in order to prevent new or recurrent cardiovascular disease, and to reduce the risk factors associated with it. 
Study characteristics 
We searched key databases of medical studies up to February 2020 and found 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (in 38 papers) that met our criteria. We grouped studies into the following three categories to help us with our interpretation of the results: 
1. Vegan dietary intervention compared to no intervention or a minimal intervention to prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease;2. Vegan dietary intervention compared to another dietary intervention to prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease;3. Vegan dietary intervention compared to another dietary intervention for people with existing cardiovascular disease, to prevent recurrence. 
Key results 
None of the trials reported on the occurrence of cardiovascular disease either in those with or without disease to begin with. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease were reported in the included studies. There was moderate‐certainty evidence for some small reductions in lipid levels with the vegan diet compared to no or minimal intervention in people without disease, but also some very small changes in measures in the opposite direction for cardiovascular benefit. In people who already had cardiovascular disease there was very limited information, as only one trial met our criteria. Four trials reported on side effects of the diet, which were either absent or minor. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Most studies had limitations in study design, so the evidence should be interpreted cautiously. In particular, the overall number of people who took part in the studies was too small to rule out the possibility of chance findings, and too small to pick up any differences in effect on our measures. 
Conclusions 
The review concludes that there is no information currently about the effects of a vegan diet on cardiovascular disease occurrence. There is limited information on the effects of the diet on those who already have cardiovascular disease, and mixed results about risk factors for those without disease. We found eight studies that are still ongoing, and when we have the results from these we will incorporate them into the review to help reduce the uncertainty. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Study on Vegan Diets for Heart Health

## Plain Title
Can a Vegan Diet Help Prevent Heart Disease?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**
Heart disease is a major health problem around the world. It can cause heart attacks, strokes, and death. What people eat plays a big role in their risk of getting heart disease.

**What is a vegan diet?**
A vegan diet means not eating any animal products. This includes meat, fish, eggs, milk, cheese, and honey. People only eat plant-based foods.

**Why was this study needed?**
Researchers wanted to know if eating a vegan diet could help prevent heart disease. They also wanted to see if it could help people who already have heart disease. Some studies suggest that plant-based diets might lower the risk of heart problems. But scientists needed to look at all the research done so far to see what the evidence really shows.

**What did researchers hope to find?**
The researchers hoped to find out if vegan diets could:
- Stop heart disease from happening in healthy people
- Lower the risk in people who might get heart disease
- Prevent heart disease from coming back in people who already have it
- Improve risk factors like high cholesterol or high blood pressure

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was not a single study. Instead, researchers looked at many studies done by other scientists. They searched medical databases up to February 2020. They found 13 studies that met their standards. These studies were randomized controlled trials. This means people were put into groups by chance.

**Who was in these studies?**
The studies included three types of people:
- Healthy adults
- People at higher risk of heart disease
- People who already had heart disease

**What did the studies compare?**
The researchers grouped the studies into three categories:
1. Vegan diet compared to no diet change
2. Vegan diet compared to other diets in people without heart disease
3. Vegan diet compared to other diets in people with heart disease

**How long did the studies last?**
The length of time varied across different studies. The review looked at studies of different lengths.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The main finding was surprising. None of the 13 studies reported whether people actually got heart disease or not. This was true for both healthy people and those with existing heart disease.

**What about risk factors?**
The studies did look at risk factors for heart disease. Risk factors are things that make heart disease more likely. These include cholesterol levels and blood pressure.

For people without heart disease:
- The vegan diet showed some small improvements in cholesterol levels
- However, some measures showed very small changes in the opposite direction
- The evidence quality was moderate

For people with heart disease:
- Only one study looked at this group
- There was very limited information available

**Were there side effects?**
Four studies reported on side effects. Most people had no side effects. When side effects did happen, they were minor.

**What are the limitations?**
The researchers found several problems with the evidence:
- The studies had design flaws
- Too few people took part in the studies
- The small number of people means results could be due to chance
- The studies were too small to detect real differences

**What are the conclusions?**

The review found that:
- There is no information about whether vegan diets prevent heart disease
- There is very little information for people who already have heart disease
- Results about risk factors are mixed and unclear
- More research is needed

**What happens next?**
The researchers found eight ongoing studies. When these studies finish, they will add the results to this review. This should help answer the questions better.

**What does this mean for patients?**
Right now, we cannot say for sure if a vegan diet prevents heart disease. More and better studies are needed. People thinking about changing their diet should talk to their doctor first."
10.1002-14651858.CD013503.pub2-pls.txt,"Enteral tube feeding for people with severe dementia
What are the advantages and problems of tube feeding people with severe dementia?  
Key messages 
Tube feeding may not increase the length of time people with severe dementia live compared to no tube feeding. The risk of developing a pressure sore is probably higher with a feeding tube than with no tube. No studies looked at quality of life.We need more and better studies to investigate tube feeding people with severe dementia. Future studies should focus on a broader range of outcomes including, pain, quality of life and the impact on carers 
What is tube feeding? 
Somebody who can’t eat or drink through their mouth may be given liquid food through a tube into their stomach. This is called enteral tube feeding. The tube passes through their nose into their stomach (a nasogastric tube), or is inserted into the stomach through a small cut in their belly (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy or PEG).  
Why is this important for people with dementia? 
People with dementia often have difficulties eating and drinking. During the early stages of dementia, they may forget to eat, chew food without swallowing, or be confused at mealtimes. Some people experience changes in the taste and smell of food. In the later stages of dementia, people often have difficulties swallowing.  It can be difficult to ensure they receive appropriate food and fluids.  
People with severe dementia need full‐time care, and it is often their families who care for them. It is difficult to decide whether or not to tube‐feed someone with dementia because the feeding tube can be uncomfortable or even painful, and may cause other unwanted effects such as pneumonia, worsen bowel or bladder control, as well as bleeding, swelling and infection. People with severe dementia may be confused or distressed by the tube and may try to remove it.  
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether tube feeding helps people with severe dementia who have problems with eating and swallowing.  
We were interested in the effect of tube feeding on:
how long people lived; 
their quality of life (well‐being); and 
the development or healing of pressure sores (also known as bed sores).
What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated whether: 
PEG compared to no tube; a nasogastric tube compared to no tube; orPEG, nasogastric and other types of tube feeding compared to no tube 
was effective and whether tube feeding caused any unwanted effects in adults of any age with severe dementia and poor intake of food and drink.  
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find?  
We included 14 studies that included 49,714 participants. Of these, 6203 were tube‐fed and 43,511 were not. Participants with no feeding tube were given standard care or standard care with extra treatments to encourage eating and drinking. 
Main results 
In people with severe dementia, compared to no tube feeding:
PEG may make no difference to how long people live (4 studies, 36,816 people), and leads to a small increase in the chance of developing pressure sores (1 study, 4421 people). we don’t know if nasogastric tube feeding increases the length of time people live or increases their chance of developing pressure sores, because none of our included studies gave information about these points. Studies of people with either PEG or nasogastric tubes showed tube feeding may increase the length of time people live (4 studies, 1696 people), and may slightly increase the chance of developing pressure sores (3 studies, 351 people).  
None of our included studies reported quality of life.
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We have moderate confidence in our finding that pressure ulcers were more common in people who were fed with a PEG tube. However, we have little to very little confidence for our other findings.  
Three main factors reduced our confidence in the evidence. Firstly, people in the studies were not randomly placed into different treatment groups. This means that differences between the groups could be due to differences between people rather than between the treatments. However, due to ethical considerations it would be very difficult to do this in future studies. Secondly, results were very inconsistent across the different studies. Finally, some studies were very small.  
The results of further research could differ from the results of this review.
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to 14 April 2021.
","# Plain Language Summary: Tube Feeding for People with Severe Dementia

## Plain Title
Does Tube Feeding Help People with Severe Dementia Who Have Trouble Eating?

## Rationale

**What is dementia and why does eating become hard?**

Dementia is a brain disease that gets worse over time. People with dementia lose their memory and have trouble thinking clearly. As dementia gets worse, eating and drinking become very hard. In early dementia, people may forget to eat. They may chew food but not swallow it. Some people find that food tastes or smells different. In late dementia, many people cannot swallow well. This makes it hard to get enough food and water.

**What is tube feeding?**

When someone cannot eat or drink by mouth, doctors can give liquid food through a tube. The tube goes into the stomach. There are two main types. One type goes through the nose into the stomach. This is called a nasogastric tube. The other type goes through a small cut in the belly into the stomach. This is called a PEG tube.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Families and doctors face a hard choice about tube feeding. The tube may be uncomfortable or painful. It can cause problems like lung infections, loss of bowel or bladder control, bleeding, swelling, and infection. People with severe dementia may get confused by the tube. They may try to pull it out. Researchers wanted to know if tube feeding helps people with severe dementia live longer and have better lives.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This study looked at research that other scientists had already done. Researchers searched for all studies about tube feeding in adults with severe dementia. They found 14 studies with 49,714 people total. Of these people, 6,203 got tube feeding and 43,511 did not. The people who did not get tubes received normal care. Some also got extra help to eat and drink by mouth.

The studies looked at three things. First, how long people lived. Second, their quality of life or well-being. Third, whether they got pressure sores. Pressure sores are also called bed sores. They happen when skin breaks down from lying or sitting too long in one place.

The studies compared different types of feeding. Some compared PEG tubes to no tube. Some compared nasogastric tubes to no tube. Some compared any type of tube to no tube.

## Results

**What were the main results of the study?**

The researchers found that tube feeding may not help people with severe dementia live longer. When they looked at PEG tubes, four studies with 36,816 people showed no difference in how long people lived. For nasogastric tubes, no studies gave clear information about this.

Tube feeding probably increases the chance of getting pressure sores. One study with 4,421 people showed PEG tubes led to more pressure sores. Three smaller studies with 351 people showed any type of tube may slightly increase pressure sores.

None of the studies looked at quality of life. This is an important gap. Quality of life means how well people feel day to day.

**Why are these results important?**

These findings suggest tube feeding may not provide the benefits many people expect. Families often hope tube feeding will help their loved one live longer or feel better. But this study found tube feeding may not extend life. It may actually cause more problems like pressure sores.

**What do the researchers conclude?**

The researchers say we need better studies. Future studies should look at more things like pain, quality of life, and how tube feeding affects family caregivers. The researchers have some concerns about their findings. The studies they reviewed were not perfect. People were not randomly assigned to get tubes or not. This makes it harder to know if the tubes caused the differences. Also, results varied a lot between different studies. Some studies were very small.

Because of these concerns, the results might change with more research. But right now, the evidence suggests tube feeding may not help people with severe dementia as much as hoped."
10.1002-14651858.CD013505-pls.txt,"Metformin for ovulation induction in women with a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome and subfertility 
Review question 
Researchers reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of metformin compared with other ovulation induction agents, for inducing ovulation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Of interest were live birth rate, gastrointestinal side effects and additional reproductive outcomes. 
Background 
Women with PCOS often have infrequent or no periods because they do not ovulate (release an egg), which can result in infertility. They may also develop problems such as obesity and diabetes. High levels of insulin, a hormone that allows the body to use sugar for energy, may be a cause of PCOS and levels are generally higher in obese women. Metformin helps the body use insulin more effectively and improves ovulation in women with PCOS. However, metformin may cause side effects such as nausea, diarrhoea or constipation (gastrointestinal side effects). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies in women with PCOS that compared metformin alone or with CC, letrozole or LOD, against CC, letrozole, LOD, placebo (sham treatment) or no treatment. This review updates the previous version of the review. We included 41 randomised controlled trials (where women were randomly allocated to a treatment) with 4552 women. 13 studies are new for this update. We combined results from the studies and assessed the quality of the studies to judge how confident we could be in their results. The evidence is current up to December 2018. 
Key results 
Metformin versus placebo/no treatment 
Metformin may increase the chances of having a live birth compared with no treatment or placebo, however women taking metformin probably experience more gastrointestinal side effects. With placebo, the live birth rate is 19%, and it would be between 19% and 37% with metformin. The risk of gastrointestinal side effects is 10% with placebo, but higher with metformin, between 22% and 40%. Women taking metformin are probably more likely to get pregnant and may be more likely to ovulate. We are uncertain about the effect of metformin compared to placebo or no treatment on miscarriage. 
Metformin plus CC versus CC alone 
We are uncertain if metformin plus CC improves live birth rate compared to CC alone, but gastrointestinal side effects are probably more common. The live birth rate with CC alone is 24% which may change to between 23% to 34% with metformin and CC combined. With CC alone, the risk of gastrointestinal side effects is 9%, which increases to between 21% to 37% with metformin and CC combined. However, pregnancy rate is probably improved with metformin and CC. Ovulation rates may be improved with metformin and CC. There was no clear evidence of an effect on miscarriage. 
Metformin versus CC 
We combined all the studies and found that the quality of evidence was very low, results were inconsistent, and we could not confidently draw conclusions. Obese women had a lower birth rate with metformin, while non‐obese women showed a possible benefit from metformin. The live birth rate of non‐obese women with CC is 26%, which may increase to between 26% and 50% with metformin. However, in obese women, the live birth rate is 22% which may decrease to between 5% to 13% with metformin. Similarly, among obese women taking metformin there may be lower rates of clinical pregnancy and ovulation while, non‐obese women taking metformin may have more pregnancies; there was no clear difference in ovulation rates. We are uncertain whether there is a difference in miscarriage rates between women taking metformin or CC. No studies reported gastrointestinal side effects. It is possible that a woman's body mass index (a measure of healthy weight based on height and weight) affects which treatment she should take, although further research is required to establish this. The limited improvement in outcomes such as diabetes with metformin highlights the importance of weight loss and lifestyle adjustment, particularly in overweight women with PCOS. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main problems were that the studies’ methods were poor or unclear, or they did not report all their results (risk of bias), or they were inaccurate and inconsistent. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Metformin for Helping Women with PCOS Get Pregnant

## Plain Title
Does metformin help women with polycystic ovary syndrome become pregnant?

## Rationale

**What is PCOS and why is it a problem?**

Some women have a condition called PCOS. This stands for polycystic ovary syndrome. Women with PCOS often do not have regular periods. This happens because their bodies do not release eggs each month. When the body does not release eggs, it is very hard to get pregnant. Women with PCOS may also gain weight easily. They may develop diabetes later in life.

**What causes PCOS?**

The body makes a hormone called insulin. Insulin helps the body use sugar for energy. Women with PCOS often have too much insulin in their blood. This high insulin level may cause PCOS. Women who are overweight usually have even higher insulin levels.

**Why study metformin?**

Metformin is a medicine that helps the body use insulin better. When insulin works better, women with PCOS may start releasing eggs again. This could help them get pregnant. However, metformin can cause stomach problems. These include feeling sick, having diarrhea, or being constipated.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know if metformin works well for women with PCOS. They wanted to see if it helps women get pregnant and have babies. They also wanted to know about side effects. They compared metformin to other treatments and to no treatment.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This was a review of many studies. Researchers looked at 41 different studies. These studies included 4,552 women total. All the women had PCOS. All the women wanted to get pregnant.

In these studies, women were put into groups by chance. Some women took metformin. Some took other medicines. Some took fake pills or no treatment. The researchers then compared the results.

The studies compared metformin to:
- Fake pills or no treatment
- A medicine called CC (clomiphene citrate)
- A medicine called letrozole
- A surgery called LOD

Some studies looked at metformin combined with other treatments.

The researchers searched for all studies up to December 2018. They looked at which treatments worked best. They counted how many women had babies. They also counted side effects.

## Results

**What were the main results of the study?**

**Metformin compared to fake pills or no treatment:**

Metformin may help more women have babies. Without treatment, about 19 out of 100 women had babies. With metformin, between 19 and 37 out of 100 women had babies. However, stomach problems were more common with metformin. Without treatment, 10 out of 100 women had stomach problems. With metformin, between 22 and 40 out of 100 women had stomach problems. Women taking metformin were more likely to get pregnant. They were also more likely to release eggs.

**Metformin plus CC compared to CC alone:**

Researchers are not sure if adding metformin to CC helps more women have babies. With CC alone, 24 out of 100 women had babies. With metformin and CC together, between 23 and 34 out of 100 women had babies. Stomach problems were more common when metformin was added. With CC alone, 9 out of 100 women had stomach problems. With both medicines, between 21 and 37 out of 100 women had stomach problems. Pregnancy rates were probably better with both medicines together.

**Metformin compared to CC:**

The results here were unclear. The quality of the studies was very low. Results were different across studies. Interestingly, a woman's weight seemed to matter. Women who were not overweight may have done better with metformin. Among non-overweight women taking CC, 26 out of 100 had babies. With metformin, between 26 and 50 out of 100 may have babies. However, overweight women may have done worse with metformin. Among overweight women taking CC, 22 out of 100 had babies. With metformin, only between 5 and 13 out of 100 may have babies.

**What do these results mean?**

Metformin may help some women with PCOS get pregnant. It works better for women who are not overweight. For overweight women, losing weight and changing lifestyle may be more important than taking metformin. More research is needed to know which women benefit most from metformin.

**Quality of the evidence:**

The quality of evidence was low to moderate. Some studies had problems with their methods. Some did not report all their results clearly."
10.1002-14651858.CD013512.pub2-pls.txt,"What surgical procedure works best to slow the progression of keratoconus (an eye disease)? 
Why is this question important?Keratoconus is a disease that affects the thin, clear outer layer of the eye, known as the cornea. Normally, the cornea is dome‐shaped. In people with keratoconus, the cornea slowly thins, and a cone‐shaped bulge develops in the center of the cornea. The disease usually begins between the ages of teens and 40, and persists throughout life. It causes blurry or distorted vision that may not be improved by wearing glasses and may result in perforation of the cornea and other visual problems. 
Treatments such as glasses and contact lenses can be used to improve the vision of people with keratoconus. However, these do not slow the progression of the disease. The only treatment known to slow disease progression is ‘corneal collagen crosslinking’ (CXL). 
CXL is a surgical procedure that aims to strengthen the cornea and prevent further thinning. It involves shining ultraviolet A (invisible) light rays onto eyes that have been treated with eye drops containing riboflavin (a vitamin). When the light rays meet the riboflavin, new links form between the fibers that make up the cornea. 
There are two types of CXL. One type requires the removal of the cells on surface of the cornea, to make it easier for the riboflavin to reach the cornea. This procedure is called ‘epithelium‐off CXL’. The other type does not require the removal of these cells. This procedure is called ‘transepithelial CXL’. Surgeons who carry out this procedure can use chemicals to help riboflavin penetrate the cells on the surface of the cornea. They can also deliver riboflavin to the cornea using a small electrical current (iontophoresis). 
Epithelium‐off CXL is the more commonly used procedure. However, transepithelial CXL could have advantages, such as faster healing and less patient discomfort. We reviewed the evidence to find out which of these two procedures is more beneficial and less risky for people with keratoconus. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?We searched the medical literature for studies that compared epithelium‐off CXL against transepithelial CXL. Then we compared the results and summarized the evidence from all the studies. We rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. 
What did we find?We found 13 studies with a total of 567 people. The studies took place in Europe, the Middle East, India, Russia, and Turkey. The shortest studies lasted six months, and the longest study lasted more than three years. Eleven studies compared transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis against epithelium‐off CXL. Three studies compared transepithelial CXL with iontophoresis against epithelium‐off CXL. 
Transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis compared to epithelium‐off CXL 
We do not know if one procedure is better than the other for preventing progression of keratoconus or visual loss because too few robust studies have compared the effects of these two CXL methods. 
Evidence from four studies suggests that corneal hazing (clouding of the cornea) or scarring are probably more common with epithelium‐off CXL. 
Transepithelial CXL with iontophoresis compared to epithelium‐off CXL 
Evidence from two studies suggests that there may be little to no difference between the two procedures in changes to vision clarity. We do not know if one procedure is better than the other to prevent progression of keratoconus because two few robust studies have compared the two methods. 
The evidence does not suggest that one procedure leads to more unwanted events than the other. However, our confidence in this evidence is low, because it is based on three studies that did not use robust methods. 
What does this mean?Due to a lack of robust evidence, we do not know if epithelium‐off CXL or transepithelial CXL is better for slowing keratoconus progression. 
Adverse events such as corneal hazing or scarring are probably more common with epithelium‐off CXL than with transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis. 
We need more and larger studies to strengthen the evidence. These should compare the benefits and the risks of different CXL procedures. Studies should aim to follow patients for more than 12 months, so that long‐term effects can be compared as it can take at least that much time for corneal tissue to heal from any procedure. 
How‐up‐to date is this review?The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to January 2020. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Eye Surgery Methods to Slow Down Keratoconus

## Plain Title
Comparing Two Types of Eye Surgery to Slow Down a Disease That Changes the Shape of the Eye

## Rationale

**What is keratoconus?**
Keratoconus is an eye disease. It affects the cornea. The cornea is the clear outer layer at the front of the eye. Normally, the cornea is shaped like a dome. In people with keratoconus, the cornea slowly gets thinner. It starts to bulge out in the middle. This makes it look more like a cone.

**Who gets this disease?**
This disease usually starts when people are teenagers or young adults. It can begin any time between the teen years and age 40. Once it starts, it lasts for life.

**What problems does it cause?**
Keratoconus makes vision blurry or distorted. Glasses often do not fix the vision problems. The cornea can develop a hole. Other serious eye problems can happen too. This disease is a burden for patients because it affects their daily life.

**What treatments are available?**
Glasses and contact lenses can help people see better. But these do not stop the disease from getting worse. Only one treatment can slow down the disease. It is called corneal collagen crosslinking, or CXL for short.

**What is CXL?**
CXL is a surgery that makes the cornea stronger. This helps stop it from getting thinner. During CXL, doctors put special eye drops in the eye. These drops contain riboflavin. Riboflavin is a vitamin. Then doctors shine a special light on the eye. This light is called ultraviolet A light. People cannot see this light. When the light touches the riboflavin, it creates new links. These links connect the fibers in the cornea. This makes the cornea stronger.

**Why did researchers do this study?**
There are two ways to do CXL surgery. The first way is called epithelium-off CXL. Doctors remove cells from the surface of the cornea first. This makes it easier for the riboflavin to reach the cornea. The second way is called transepithelial CXL. Doctors do not remove the surface cells. Sometimes they use chemicals to help the riboflavin get through. Sometimes they use a small electrical current called iontophoresis.

Epithelium-off CXL is used more often. But transepithelial CXL might have benefits. Patients might heal faster. They might feel less discomfort. Researchers wanted to find out which method works better. They also wanted to know which method is safer.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**
This is a review of research studies. Researchers looked at 13 different studies. These studies included 567 people total. The studies took place in many countries. These included countries in Europe, the Middle East, India, Russia, and Turkey.

**What did the studies compare?**
Eleven studies compared transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis to epithelium-off CXL. Three studies compared transepithelial CXL with iontophoresis to epithelium-off CXL.

**How long did the studies last?**
The shortest studies lasted six months. The longest study lasted more than three years.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

**Transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis compared to epithelium-off CXL:**
Researchers do not know if one method is better than the other. There were not enough good studies to compare how well each method stops the disease. There were not enough studies to compare vision loss between the two methods.

Four studies looked at side effects. Corneal hazing is when the cornea becomes cloudy. Scarring can also happen. These problems were probably more common with epithelium-off CXL.

**Transepithelial CXL with iontophoresis compared to epithelium-off CXL:**
Two studies looked at changes in how clearly people could see. There was probably little to no difference between the two methods. Researchers do not know if one method is better at stopping the disease. There were not enough good studies.

Three studies looked at unwanted events or side effects. The evidence does not show that one method causes more problems than the other. But researchers have low confidence in this finding. The studies did not use strong methods.

**What do these results mean?**
There is not enough strong evidence to know which method is better. More research is needed. Future studies should be larger. They should follow patients for more than 12 months. The cornea needs at least that much time to heal. This would help researchers understand the long-term effects.

One finding seems clear. Corneal hazing and scarring probably happen more often with epithelium-off CXL. This is compared to transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis.

**How current is this information?**
Researchers looked at all available evidence up to January 2020."
10.1002-14651858.CD013515.pub2-pls.txt,"What are the benefits and risks of psychological therapies for adults and young people over 12 years old with painful temporomandibular disorders (TMDs)? 
Key messages 
The overall results are mixed, but indicate that psychological therapies may be a useful approach for painful TMD as there is some limited evidence that they can reduce the pain. Our review suggests that they may do this at least as well as other available treatments. Any negative effects of psychological therapies are unclear, and more research is needed before we can know whether they provide a noticeable benefit while causing no or few problems. 
What is the condition? 
Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are conditions that affect the jaw joint and the muscles that move it. They are often associated with pain that lasts more than 3 months (known as chronic pain). Other symptoms include limited mouth opening, and jaw clicking and locking. All symptoms can interfere with quality of life and mood. 
What did we want to know? 
We wanted to find out how effective psychological therapies are for adults and young people over the age of 12 years who have painful TMD that has lasted at least 3 months. 
What did we do? 
We searched databases of medical and dental journals and research studies. We only selected studies known as 'randomised controlled trials (RCTs)'. In this type of study, participants are allocated to groups randomly. One group receives the intervention and the other receives a different treatment or no treatment at all. RCTs aim to reduce the risk of introducing bias in clinical studies. 
We looked for reports of RCTs of psychological therapies compared to different treatments or no treatment in people over 12 years of age. Most of the reports we found compared psychological therapy to medication or the use of a special mouthguard.  
We chose to focus on three measures of success. These were reduction in pain intensity, interference with activities caused by pain ('pain disability'), and psychological distress. We looked for details of these measures immediately after treatment and a few months later. We also looked for information on any 'adverse effects' (negative side effects of the treatments).  
We used standard Cochrane methods to decide which studies to include, collect the key information from the studies, judge whether or not the studies were biased in any way, and judge how certain we can be about the results. 
What did we find? 
Overall we found 22 relevant studies. Most of the studies reported on one particular form of psychological therapy called cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). We did not have enough information to draw any conclusions about any other psychological therapies. 
The results told us that CBT was no different to other treatments (e.g. oral splints, medicine) or usual care/no treatment in reducing the intensity of the TMD pain by the end of treatment. There was some evidence that people who had CBT might have slightly less pain a few months after treatment.  
There was some evidence that CBT might be better than other treatments for reducing psychological distress both at the end of treatment and a few months later. This was not seen in the one study that compared CBT against usual care. 
In terms of how much pain interfered with activities, there was no evidence that there was any difference between CBT and other treatments.  
There was too little information to be sure about whether psychological treatments cause adverse effects (problems caused by treatment such as feeling unwell or worse pain or unexpected effects). Only six of the 22 studies measured what adverse effects participants experienced. In these six studies, adverse effects associated with psychological treatment seemed to be minor in general and to occur less often than in alternative treatment groups.  
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We have little confidence in the evidence because many of the studies had design limitations. There was also variation in the length of treatment and in how it was delivered. This means that we need to be cautious in interpreting the results that we found and they may not be reliable. 
How up to date is the evidence? 
We searched for studies up to 21 October 2021.
","# Plain Language Summary: Psychological Therapies for Jaw Pain

## Plain Title
Can Talking Therapies Help Adults and Teens with Long-Lasting Jaw Pain?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some people have pain in their jaw joint. This is called TMD. The jaw joint is where your lower jaw connects to your skull. TMD can cause pain that lasts for months or years. People with TMD may also have trouble opening their mouth. Their jaw may click or lock. These problems can make life harder and affect mood.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors want to know if talking therapies can help people with jaw pain. Talking therapies help people change how they think about pain. They also teach ways to cope with pain. One common talking therapy is called CBT. CBT stands for cognitive behavior therapy. This therapy might help reduce pain. It might also help people feel less upset about their pain.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to see if talking therapies work for jaw pain. They looked at adults and young people over age 12. They wanted to know if these therapies reduce pain. They also wanted to know if the therapies cause any problems.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked for studies already done by other scientists. They searched medical journals and research records. They only picked studies that were well designed. These studies split people into groups by chance. One group got talking therapy. Other groups got different treatments or no treatment. This helps make the results fair.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included adults and teens over 12 years old. All had jaw pain lasting at least 3 months. Most studies compared talking therapy to other treatments. Some people got mouth guards. Others got medicine. Some got usual care or no treatment.

**What did researchers measure?**

Researchers looked at three main things. First, they measured how much pain people felt. Second, they checked if pain stopped people from doing daily tasks. Third, they looked at emotional distress like worry or sadness. They checked these things right after treatment ended. They also checked a few months later. They looked for any bad effects from treatment.

**How many studies were found?**

Researchers found 22 studies that fit their needs. Most studies tested CBT. There was not enough information about other talking therapies.

## Results

**What did the studies show about pain?**

CBT did not reduce pain more than other treatments right after treatment ended. But a few months later, people who had CBT might have slightly less pain. This suggests CBT could have lasting benefits. The difference was small but might matter to patients.

**What about emotional distress?**

CBT seemed to help reduce worry and sadness. This was true both right after treatment and months later. People felt less upset when compared to those getting other treatments. One study compared CBT to usual care. That study did not show this benefit.

**Did CBT help with daily activities?**

The studies did not show that CBT helped people do daily tasks more easily. Pain interfered with activities about the same in all groups.

**Were there any problems from treatment?**

Only 6 out of 22 studies checked for bad effects. In those studies, talking therapy caused few problems. When problems did happen, they were minor. People getting other treatments had more problems. But we need more information to be sure.

**What do these results mean?**

Talking therapies like CBT may help some people with jaw pain. They might reduce pain over time. They may help people feel less worried or sad. They seem safe with few bad effects. They work at least as well as other treatments like mouth guards or medicine.

**What are the limits of this research?**

Many studies had design problems. This makes the results less certain. Studies used different treatment lengths. They delivered therapy in different ways. We cannot be completely sure the results are reliable. More and better studies are needed.

**How current is this information?**

Researchers searched for studies through October 21, 2021.

**What comes next?**

More research is needed. Future studies should be better designed. They should measure bad effects more carefully. This will help doctors know if talking therapies truly help jaw pain. It will also show if these therapies are safe for most people."
10.1002-14651858.CD013518.pub2-pls.txt,"Combination fixed‐dose beta agonist and steroid inhaler as required for adults or children with mild asthma 
Background 
Asthma is the most common respiratory illness. Many people with asthma have mild asthma, but still remain at risk of severe asthma exacerbations, which often result in the use of oral steroids. Mild asthma is commonly treated with preventative inhalers, which contain a steroid used to reduce inflammation in the airways, and with reliever inhalers, which relax the muscles of the airways causing quick relief of asthma symptoms. Combination inhalers contain both the preventative steroid and the reliever, simplifying treatment and ensuring steroids are always given alongside the immediate relief of symptoms. 
Review question 
We examined the findings of clinical trials to assess the use of combination inhalers in the treatment of mild asthma when taken on an as‐needed, symptom‐driven basis. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to March 2021. Results were collected from six studies which compared use of a combination inhaler used on an as‐needed basis with either as‐needed reliever‐only therapy or daily treatment with a low dose preventative inhaler. 
Key findings 
We found that combination inhalers used as‐needed when compared with reliever‐only treatment reduced severe exacerbations requiring tablet steroids and rates of emergency admission to hospital with asthma symptoms. Differences in other measures relating to symptom control and lung function were too small to be clinically important. Rates of severe exacerbations were similar between patients on daily preventative steroid inhalers and those using combination inhalers as‐needed. People using combination inhalers had lower rates of hospital admission and lower total inhaled steroid dose, whilst the differences in lung function and asthma symptom control were not clinically significant. 
This review found the use of combination inhalers used when the patient experiences asthma symptoms was beneficial in reducing severe exacerbations when compared to stand‐alone reliever therapy in mild asthma. In addition to this the use of combination inhalers used on an as‐needed basis was associated with a reduction in hospital admissions and total inhaled steroid dose when compared with regularly‐taken low dose preventative inhaler therapy. 
Quality of the evidence 
The studies which contributed data were well‐designed and robust, although two were open‐label (participants knew which treatment they were getting), with some potential for bias, so the evidence was generally of moderate‐to‐high quality. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Using a Combination Inhaler Only When Needed for People with Mild Asthma

## Rationale

**What is asthma and why does it matter?**

Asthma is a very common lung disease. Many people have mild asthma. Even mild asthma can cause serious flare-ups. These flare-ups often need steroid pills to treat them.

**How is asthma usually treated?**

Doctors usually give two types of inhalers:
- A preventer inhaler has steroids. Steroids reduce swelling in the airways.
- A reliever inhaler relaxes airway muscles. This gives quick relief from symptoms.

**What is a combination inhaler?**

A combination inhaler has both medicines in one device. It has the steroid and the reliever together. This makes treatment simpler. It also means patients get steroids every time they use the reliever.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if combination inhalers work well for mild asthma. They wanted to see if people could use them only when they have symptoms. This is different from using a preventer inhaler every day.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This was a review of research studies. Researchers looked at six different studies. They searched for studies up to March 2021.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included adults and children with mild asthma.

**What did researchers compare?**

They compared three treatment approaches:
- Combination inhaler used only when needed
- Reliever inhaler only, used when needed
- Preventer inhaler used every day at a low dose

The studies tracked how well each approach worked.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

Researchers found important differences between treatments.

**Combination inhaler versus reliever-only:**

When people used combination inhalers instead of reliever-only inhalers:
- They had fewer serious asthma flare-ups
- Fewer people needed steroid pills
- Fewer people went to the hospital for asthma
- Symptom control was similar between groups
- Lung function was similar between groups

**Combination inhaler versus daily preventer:**

When people used combination inhalers as needed instead of daily preventers:
- Serious flare-ups happened at similar rates
- Fewer people went to the hospital
- People used less total steroid medicine
- Symptom control was similar between groups
- Lung function was similar between groups

**What do these results mean for patients?**

Using a combination inhaler when symptoms occur helps people with mild asthma. It works better than using only a reliever inhaler. It prevents serious flare-ups and hospital visits.

Combination inhalers used as needed also work well compared to daily preventers. People get similar protection from flare-ups. But they go to the hospital less often. They also use less steroid medicine overall.

**How good was this research?**

Most studies were well designed and trustworthy. Two studies had some limitations. Patients in those studies knew which treatment they received. This could affect results slightly. Overall, the evidence quality was moderate to high.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

Combination inhalers used only when needed are helpful for mild asthma. They reduce serious flare-ups better than reliever inhalers alone. They also reduce hospital visits and steroid use compared to daily preventer inhalers. This gives patients a simpler treatment option that works well."
10.1002-14651858.CD013581-abstract.txt,"Anti‐inflammatory drugs for acute low back pain
Review question 
We examined the effect of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen, for people with acute low back pain. Acute low back pain is defined as the presence of pain in the back, below the ribs and above the buttocks, for under 12 weeks. We compared NSAIDs to placebo, paracetamol, other NSAIDs, other drugs, and non‐drug treatments. 
Background 
Acute low back pain is common, and causes pain and disability. Physicians often prescribe NSAIDs to treat acute low back pain. Different types of NSAIDs are available, both over‐the‐counter and as prescription drugs. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials that were published or registered before 7 January 2020. We included 32 trials with 5356 participants. Trial participants were 16 to 78 years old and had acute low back pain. Study length varied from one day to six months. The studies took place in many different countries. More than half of the studies was done in Europe and North‐America. 
Key results 
NSAIDs were slightly more effective than placebo for pain reduction in the first three weeks. On average, the pain intensity decreased by 7.3 points on a 100‐point scale. This means there was a small difference between the two treatments, but it was not clinically relevant. People receiving NSAIDs also scored 2.0 points better on a 24‐point disability scale than those receiving placebo. This is unlikely to be of real‐world benefit. There was a similar number of side effects between people receiving NSAIDs and people receiving placebo. However, the type of studies that we investigated are not designed to find side effects. Therefore, we should be careful about drawing conclusions based upon these findings. 
We also compared two different types of NSAIDs; non‐selective NSAIDs versus COX‐2 inhibitors. We found no clear differences in effect. There was also a similar number of reported side effects of the digestive system, such as abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, or stomach symptoms. 
Quality of the evidence 
There is moderate quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective than placebo for reducing short‐term pain, and high quality evidence that they are slightly more effective than placebo for reducing disability in acute low back pain. The magnitude of the effect is very small.

Low back pain is very common. It affects the area below the ribs and above the buttocks. When this pain lasts less than 12 weeks, doctors call it ""acute"" low back pain. This means the pain is new or sudden.

This type of pain can make daily life hard. People may have trouble moving, working, or doing normal tasks. The pain can stop people from enjoying their usual activities.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors often give patients anti-inflammatory drugs for back pain. These drugs are called NSAIDs. Common examples include ibuprofen, naproxen, and diclofenac. Some you can buy at the store. Others need a prescription from a doctor.

Researchers wanted to know if these drugs really help. They wanted to find out how well NSAIDs work compared to other treatments. They also wanted to see if these drugs cause side effects.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

The researchers wanted to answer one main question: Do NSAIDs help reduce pain and improve movement in people with sudden low back pain? They compared NSAIDs to fake pills (called placebo), other pain drugs, and other types of treatment.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at many smaller studies done by other scientists. They searched for all studies published before January 2020. They only included high-quality studies where patients were put into groups by chance.

**Who was in the studies?**

The review included 32 different studies. These studies had 5,356 people in total. The people were between 16 and 78 years old. All of them had sudden low back pain.

The studies took place in many countries around the world. More than half were done in Europe and North America.

**How long did the studies last?**

The length of studies varied. Some lasted just one day. Others lasted up to six months. Most studies looked at pain relief in the first three weeks.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

NSAIDs worked slightly better than fake pills for reducing pain. People taking NSAIDs had their pain decrease by about 7 points on a scale from 0 to 100. This is a small difference. It may not make a big difference in daily life.

People taking NSAIDs also did slightly better with movement and daily tasks. They scored 2 points better on a 24-point scale. Again, this small difference may not help much in real life.

**Were there side effects?**

About the same number of people had side effects with NSAIDs and fake pills. However, these types of studies are not the best way to find side effects. We need to be careful about making conclusions from this finding.

**Did different types of NSAIDs work differently?**

Researchers compared two types of NSAIDs. One type is called non-selective NSAIDs. The other type is called COX-2 inhibitors. Both types worked about the same. Both had similar side effects on the stomach and digestive system.

**What do these results mean?**

NSAIDs help reduce pain and improve movement slightly. But the benefit is very small. It may not make a meaningful difference for most people with sudden low back pain.

**How reliable are these findings?**

The quality of evidence was moderate to high. This means we can trust these findings. The results are likely correct.

**What should patients know?**

If you have sudden low back pain, NSAIDs may help a little. But the benefit is small. Talk to your doctor about the best treatment for you. Consider both the small benefits and possible side effects."
10.1002-14651858.CD013664.pub2-abstract.txt,"The use of additional medication during cataract surgery to improve the continued success of a pre‐existing operation (trabeculectomy) 
Why is this question important?Glaucoma and cataract are a global problem that can impact a person's economic and social circumstances. Vision loss from glaucoma is permanent, as the increased eye pressure that occurs in glaucoma damages the optic nerve which carries signals from the eye to the brain. The primary aim of treatment for glaucoma is to reduce this pressure, hence slowing down any progressive damage to vision. 
Although medical and laser treatments are effective in treating glaucoma, an operation known as a trabeculectomy is required when these treatments do not stop progression of damage to vision. A small hole is cut in the white of the eye to allow excess fluid to drain from the eye. When a person with a trabeculectomy undergoes cataract surgery, an additional medication is often used to stop the eye healing too much and creating scar tissue, which can block the drainage hole and cause the trabeculectomy to fail. 
In this review, we looked at patients with a functioning trabeculectomy who were undergoing cataract surgery and who received additional medication (5‐fluorouracil, mitomycin C, or anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor therapy) versus those who did not receive any additional medication. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?We searched for randomised controlled trials (studies in which people are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups), because these studies provide the strongest evidence about the effects of a given treatment. We planned to combine the results of the included studies to arrive at an answer to our research question. 
What did we find?We found no randomised controlled trials that met our inclusion criteria. 
What does this mean?We do not know whether an additional medical treatment during cataract surgery improves the chances of the drainage hole remaining open, as there is no evidence at present. It would be helpful if more studies were conducted in this area in future. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to April 2021. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Using Extra Medicine During Cataract Surgery to Help a Previous Glaucoma Operation Keep Working

## Plain Title
Does extra medicine during cataract surgery help keep a previous glaucoma drainage operation working?

## Rationale

**What are glaucoma and cataracts?**

Glaucoma and cataracts are two common eye problems that affect people around the world. These conditions can make it hard for people to work and do daily activities.

Glaucoma happens when pressure builds up inside the eye. This high pressure damages the optic nerve. The optic nerve sends signals from the eye to the brain so you can see. When glaucoma damages this nerve, you lose vision forever. It cannot be fixed.

A cataract makes the lens of the eye cloudy. This also causes vision problems.

**How is glaucoma treated?**

The main goal of glaucoma treatment is to lower eye pressure. This helps slow down vision loss.

Doctors first try eye drops and laser treatments. Sometimes these treatments do not work well enough. When this happens, doctors do an operation called a trabeculectomy. During this operation, the doctor cuts a small hole in the white part of the eye. This hole lets extra fluid drain out. This lowers the pressure inside the eye.

**What is the problem this study looked at?**

Some people who have had a trabeculectomy later need cataract surgery. During cataract surgery, the eye can heal too much. The body may make scar tissue. This scar tissue can block the drainage hole from the trabeculectomy. When the hole gets blocked, the trabeculectomy stops working. The eye pressure goes up again.

**Why might extra medicine help?**

Doctors sometimes use extra medicine during cataract surgery to stop too much healing. These medicines include 5-fluorouracil, mitomycin C, or anti-VEGF therapy. The hope is that these medicines will keep the drainage hole open.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if using extra medicine during cataract surgery really helps. They wanted to see if it keeps the drainage hole working better than not using extra medicine.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

The researchers looked for a specific type of study called a randomized controlled trial. In these studies, some patients get the extra medicine and some do not. Which group each patient joins is decided by chance, like flipping a coin. This type of study gives the best answers about whether a treatment works.

The researchers wanted to find studies that included:
- Adults who had a working trabeculectomy
- People who needed cataract surgery
- Some patients who got extra medicine during cataract surgery
- Some patients who did not get extra medicine

They searched for all studies done up to April 2021.

## Results

**What were the main results of the study?**

The researchers found no studies that met their requirements. They could not find any randomized controlled trials that tested extra medicine during cataract surgery in people with a previous trabeculectomy.

**What does this mean for patients?**

Right now, we do not know if extra medicine during cataract surgery helps keep the drainage hole open. There is no strong evidence to answer this question.

Doctors cannot be sure if using these extra medicines helps patients or not.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

More research is needed. Future studies should test whether extra medicine during cataract surgery helps people who have had a trabeculectomy. These studies would help doctors know the best way to care for patients who need both operations.

Until better studies are done, we cannot say for certain whether extra medicine helps or not."
10.1002-14651858.CD013666.pub2-pls.txt,"Short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators for cystic fibrosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for using short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators (treatments which widen and open the airways, making it easier to breathe) in people with cystic fibrosis. Short‐acting bronchodilators take effect quickly and generally last 4 to 6 hours. We were interested in any type of short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator, given at any dose, and by any type of device (inhalers or nebulisers). 
Both nebulisers and inhalers deliver medicine. Nebulisers turn liquid medication into an easily‐inhaled mist. They vary in type but need a power source, e.g. a rechargeable battery, to function. Inhalers deliver short bursts of medicine (as an aerosol or dry powder) via a manual handheld device. The most common type of inhaler is a metered‐dose inhaler. Inhalers can be used with spacers (empty tubes, usually made from plastic that slot onto the mouthpiece of the inhaler).  
Inhaled bronchodilators are used by many people with cystic fibrosis to help them breathe, and to make it easier to clear mucus from their lungs. We wanted to know if these treatments were better than a placebo (dummy) treatment or another type of short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to 28 March 2022.
Trial characteristics 
The review included 11 trials with 191 people with cystic fibrosis aged between 5 and 40 years of age. Trials compared two different types of short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator (beta‐2 agonists such as salbutamol or albuterol, and muscarinic antagonists such as ipratropium bromide) against a placebo substance which contained no medication, or a different short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator; three of the trials had three comparison groups ‐ beta‐2 agonists versus muscarinic antagonists versus placebo. All trials were cross‐over trials, so all of the people included in the trial received both treatments at different times, and the order that they received the treatments was random. The trials lasted from a single‐dose trial to 6 months. Eight trials looked at the effects of short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists versus placebo, four trials at the effects of a short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonist versus placebo, and three trials looked at the effects of a short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonist with a short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonist. 
Key results 
All trials looked at the effect of short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators on lung function, measured as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), but this was reported in different ways and at different time points.  
We are uncertain whether any of the short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators have an effect on FEV1 compared to placebo. The trials were too small and there were not enough data to show if there was an effect or not. 
Only six of the 11 trials reported on harmful effects of treatment: one trial reported no harmful effects and five trials reported mild tremors, dry mouth and fatigue. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence across all trials was very low. All trials used a cross‐over design where the participants are given one treatment and then swapped to the other treatment with a washout period (the length of time for a drug to be eliminated from the body) in between. It is possible that the clinical status of participants was not the same at the beginning of the first treatment phase as at the beginning of the second treatment phase. The trials were also very small and were carried out more than 10 years ago. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Short-Acting Inhaled Bronchodilators for Cystic Fibrosis

## Plain Title
Do fast-acting inhaled medicines help people with cystic fibrosis breathe better?

## Rationale

**What is cystic fibrosis?**
Cystic fibrosis is a disease that affects the lungs. It causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the airways. This makes it hard to breathe and hard to clear mucus from the lungs.

**What are bronchodilators?**
Bronchodilators are medicines that open up the airways. They make the tubes in the lungs wider. This helps people breathe more easily. Short-acting bronchodilators work quickly. They usually last 4 to 6 hours.

**How are these medicines given?**
These medicines are breathed in through the mouth. They can be given two ways:
- Inhalers: Small handheld devices that spray medicine into the mouth
- Nebulizers: Machines that turn liquid medicine into a mist

**Why was this study needed?**
Many people with cystic fibrosis use these medicines. Doctors wanted to know if they really help. They wanted to see if these medicines work better than fake medicine (called placebo). They also wanted to know if one type works better than another type.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at 11 different studies. These studies included 191 people with cystic fibrosis. The people were between 5 and 40 years old.

**What medicines were tested?**
Two main types of bronchodilators were tested:
- Beta-2 agonists (like salbutamol or albuterol)
- Muscarinic antagonists (like ipratropium bromide)

These were compared to fake medicine with no active drug.

**How were the studies run?**
All studies used a cross-over design. This means each person tried both treatments at different times. The order was chosen randomly. Between treatments, there was a rest period. This let the first medicine leave the body.

**How long did the studies last?**
Some studies lasted just one day (single dose). The longest study lasted 6 months.

## Results

**What did researchers measure?**
Researchers mainly looked at lung function. They measured how much air people could blow out in one second. This is called FEV1.

**What did the studies find?**
The researchers could not tell if these medicines really help. The studies were too small. There was not enough information to know for sure if the medicines worked better than fake medicine.

**Were there any side effects?**
Six of the 11 studies reported on side effects:
- One study found no side effects
- Five studies found mild side effects like shaking, dry mouth, and feeling tired

**How reliable are these results?**
The quality of evidence was very low. This means we cannot be sure about the results. Here is why:

The studies were very small. They did not include many people. This makes it hard to see clear results.

The studies were done more than 10 years ago. Treatment for cystic fibrosis has changed since then.

The cross-over design may have caused problems. People's health may have been different at the start of each treatment period.

**What does this mean?**
We still do not know if short-acting inhaled bronchodilators help people with cystic fibrosis. More research is needed. Future studies should include more people. They should use newer study designs.

**Conclusion**
Many people with cystic fibrosis use these medicines. But we need better studies to know if they really work. The current evidence is not strong enough to give clear answers.

10.1002-14651858.CD013667.pub2-pls.txt,"Interventions for children and adolescents who self‐harm
We have reviewed the international literature regarding psychosocial interventions, pharmacological (drug), and natural product (dietary supplementation) treatment trials in the field. A total of 17 trials meeting our inclusion criteria were identified. There is little evidence of beneficial effects for individual cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)‐based psychotherapy, mentalisation‐based therapy for adolescents (MBT‐A), group‐based psychotherapy, enhanced assessment approaches, compliance enhancement approaches, family interventions, or remote contact interventions. There is some evidence of effectiveness for dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT‐A) for adolescents. However, few trials have been conducted and those that have are generally small, meaning that possible beneficial effects of some of these therapies cannot be ruled out. 
Why is this review important? 
Self‐harm (SH), which includes intentional self‐poisoning/overdose and self‐injury, is a major problem in many countries and is strongly linked with suicide. It is therefore important that effective treatments for SH patients are developed. There has been an increase in the use of interventions for SH in children and adolescents. It is therefore important to assess the evidence for their effectiveness. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
Hospital administrators (e.g. service providers), health policy officers and third party payers (e.g. health insurers), clinicians working with patients who engage in SH, patients themselves, and their relatives. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
This review is an update of a previous Cochrane Review from 2015 which found little evidence of beneficial effects of interventions for SH in children and adolescents. This updated review aims to further evaluate the evidence for effectiveness of interventions for children and adolescents with SH with a broader range of outcomes. 
Which studies were included in the review? 
To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials of either psychosocial or drug treatments for children and adolescents up to 18 years of age who had recently engaged in SH. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
There have been surprisingly few investigations of treatments for SH in children and adolescents, despite the size of this problem in many countries. We found positive effects of DBT‐A on repetition of SH. There is currently no clear evidence for the effectiveness of individual CBT‐based psychotherapy, MBT‐A, group‐based psychotherapy, enhanced assessment approaches, compliance enhancement approaches, family interventions, or remote contact interventions in preventing repetition of SH. 
What should happen next? 
We recommend further trials of DBT‐A. Given the evidence for its benefit for adults who engage in SH, individual CBT‐based psychotherapy should also be further developed and evaluated in children and adolescents. Given the extent of SH in children and adolescents, greater attention should be paid to the development and evaluation of specific therapies for this population. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Testing Treatments to Help Children and Teens Who Harm Themselves

## Rationale

**What is self-harm and why does it matter?**

Self-harm means when someone hurts themselves on purpose. This can include taking too many pills or cutting or injuring their body. Many children and teens around the world harm themselves. This is a very serious problem. Self-harm is closely linked to suicide. People who harm themselves may be at risk of dying by suicide.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors and nurses need to know which treatments work best to help young people who self-harm. More and more treatments are being used with children and teens. But we need to know if these treatments really help. This study looked at all the research done so far. The goal was to find out which treatments actually work.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to see if different types of treatment could stop young people from harming themselves again. They looked at talk therapy, medicines, and diet supplements. This study updates an earlier review from 2015. That review found little proof that treatments worked. The researchers wanted to check if newer studies showed better results.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. The researchers looked at other studies that had already been done. They only included studies that were done in a careful way. These are called randomized controlled trials. In these trials, some patients get the treatment being tested. Other patients get a different treatment or usual care. This helps show if the new treatment really works.

**Who was included in these studies?**

The studies looked at children and teens up to 18 years old. All of them had recently harmed themselves. Some studies tested talk therapy. Others tested medicines. The studies compared different types of treatment.

**What types of treatment were tested?**

The researchers found 17 studies to review. These studies tested many different treatments:
- One-on-one talk therapy based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
- A therapy called DBT-A (dialectical behavior therapy for teens)
- A therapy called MBT-A (mentalization-based therapy for teens)
- Group therapy sessions
- Better assessment methods
- Ways to help patients follow their treatment plan
- Family therapy
- Phone calls or text messages to check in

**How long did the studies last?**

The length of time varied across different studies. Each original study had its own time frame.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The review found 17 studies that met the requirements. Most treatments did not show clear proof that they worked. This includes:
- One-on-one CBT-based therapy
- MBT-A therapy
- Group therapy
- Better assessment approaches
- Methods to improve following treatment plans
- Family therapy
- Remote contact like phone calls or texts

However, one treatment showed some promise. DBT-A therapy may help reduce self-harm in teens. This therapy had positive effects in stopping young people from harming themselves again.

**What does this mean?**

The studies were mostly small. This means we cannot say for sure that some treatments do not work. They might help, but we need bigger studies to know. Right now, there is not enough proof that most treatments work for young people who self-harm.

**What should happen next?**

The researchers say we need more studies of DBT-A. This treatment showed the most promise. CBT-based therapy works for adults who self-harm. So researchers should keep developing and testing this therapy for young people too.

Self-harm is a big problem for many children and teens. We need much more research. Scientists should focus on creating and testing treatments made specifically for young people. Right now, we do not have enough good treatments. This needs to change.

**Why is this important?**

This review helps doctors, hospitals, families, and patients understand what works. It shows that we need better treatments for young people who self-harm. More research is urgently needed to help this vulnerable group."

Self‐harm (SH), which includes intentional self‐poisoning/overdose and self‐injury, is a major problem in many countries and is strongly linked with suicide. It is therefore important that effective treatments for SH patients are developed. Whilst there has been an increase in the use of psychosocial interventions for SH in adults (which is the focus of a separate review), drug treatments are frequently used in clinical practice. It is therefore important to assess the evidence for their effectiveness.

A Review of Medicines and Natural Products to Help Adults Who Self-Harm

## Rationale

**What is self-harm and why is it important?**

Self-harm means hurting yourself on purpose. This can include taking too much medicine or hurting your body in other ways. Many adults around the world self-harm. This is a serious problem. People who self-harm are more likely to die by suicide. This makes self-harm a major health concern.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors often give medicines to adults who self-harm. But we need to know if these medicines actually help. Do they stop people from harming themselves again? This review looked at the research to find out.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to see if medicines or natural products work for adults who self-harm. They looked at different types of treatments. These included medicines for depression, medicines for mental health conditions, mood-stabilizing medicines, and natural products like vitamins or supplements.

This review updates an earlier review from 2015. The earlier review found little proof that medicines helped. This new review looks at more information to see if anything has changed.

## Trial Design

**How was this review done?**

This is a review of other studies. Researchers looked at many published studies from around the world. They only included certain types of studies. These were called randomized controlled trials. These are high-quality studies that test if treatments work.

**What studies were included?**

The studies had to meet specific rules to be included:
- They had to test medicines or natural products
- They had to include adults who had recently self-harmed
- They had to be randomized controlled trials

The researchers found seven studies that met all the rules.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included adults who had self-harmed. This means people 18 years old or older. Both men and women were included. All participants had hurt themselves recently before joining the studies.

## Results

**What did the review find?**

The review found very little proof that medicines or natural products help adults who self-harm. The researchers looked at whether these treatments stopped people from self-harming again. They did not find clear evidence that any treatment worked.

The types of treatments studied included:
- Antidepressants (medicines for depression)
- Antipsychotics (medicines for some mental health conditions)
- Mood stabilizers (medicines that help control mood)
- Natural products (like dietary supplements)

None of these showed clear benefits.

**Why are these results uncertain?**

Only seven studies were found. This is a very small number. Also, these studies were small. They did not include many people. When studies are small, it is hard to know for sure if a treatment works or not. A treatment might help, but the study might be too small to show it.

**What do these results mean?**

Right now, we cannot say that medicines or natural products help prevent self-harm in adults. But we also cannot say they definitely do not work. We need more research to know for sure.

**What should happen next?**

The researchers say we need more studies. These studies should be bigger. They should include more people. Future studies might test medicines combined with talk therapy. This combination might work better than medicine alone.

**Why does this matter?**

This review is important for many people:
- Doctors who treat patients who self-harm
- Patients who self-harm
- Family members of people who self-harm
- Hospitals and health care systems
- People who make health care policies
- Insurance companies

All these groups need to know what treatments work. Right now, the evidence does not clearly support using medicines or natural products alone to prevent self-harm in adults."

How well do newer formulations of antidepressants work for children and adolescents with clinical depression? 
Children and adolescents (6 to 18 years) with depression (also called ‘major depressive disorder’) experience a range of negative impacts in all areas of their lives and have an increased risk of suicide, suicidal thinking and suicide attempts. Antidepressants have been shown to reduce symptoms of depression, but can also increase the risk of suicide‐related outcomes. 
Who will be interested in this research? 
The research in this Cochrane Review will interest:
‐ people who decide policy, and influence decisions about the prescription of antidepressant medicines to children and adolescents; 
‐ people who prescribe these medicines to children and adolescents;
‐ children and adolescents with depression; and
‐ those who support and care for them (including their parents and caregivers and clinicians who provide treatment). 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out how well newer formulations (called ‘new generation’) antidepressants work to improve depression in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years. New generation antidepressants are those that have been developed recently. They are sometimes referred to as ‘second‐‘ and ‘third‐generation’ antidepressants; they do not include older formulations (tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors). 
We wanted to know how these antidepressants affect:
‐ symptoms of depression;
‐ recovery: no longer meeting diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder;
‐ response or remission: scores on a scale indicating an important reduction in depression or no longer experiencing depression; 
‐ ability to function in daily life;
‐ suicide‐related outcomes; and
‐ whether they cause any unwanted effects in children and adolescents.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that tested new generation antidepressants on children or adolescents (or both) who had been diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. We identified 26 such studies. We then assessed the trustworthiness of those studies, and synthesized the findings across the studies. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
Most newer antidepressants probably reduce depression symptoms better than a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment that does not contain any medicine but looks identical to the medicine being tested). However, the reduction is small and may not be experienced as important by children and adolescents, their parents and caregivers, or clinicians. When different medications are compared against each other, there may be only small and unimportant differences between most of them for the reduction of symptoms. 
Our findings reflect what happens on average to individuals, but some individuals may experience a greater response. This might lead to recommendations being made for the use of antidepressants for some individuals in some circumstances. Our findings suggest that sertraline, escitalopram, duloxetine and fluoxetine can be used if medication is being considered. 
The impact of medication on depression symptoms should be closely monitored by those prescribing the medication, especially as suicide‐related thinking and behaviour may be increased in those taking these medications. Close monitoring of suicide‐related behaviours is vital in those treated with new generation antidepressants. 
What should happen next? 
The studies that provided this evidence largely excluded children and adolescents who: 
‐ were already thinking about suicide and wanting to take their own lives (i.e. had suicidal ideation); 
‐ were self‐harming;
‐ had other mental health conditions; and
‐ had psychosocial difficulties.
Future research should aim to understand the impacts of these medicines in children and adolescents with these problems, who are more typical of those who request clinical services. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Do Newer Antidepressants Help Children and Teens with Depression?

## Plain Title

Testing How Well Newer Antidepressants Work for Children and Teens with Depression

## Rationale

**What is depression and why does it matter?**

Depression is also called major depressive disorder. Children and teens aged 6 to 18 years with depression feel very sad and down. This affects all parts of their lives. They may have trouble at school, with friends, and at home. Depression also raises the risk of suicide. This means some young people may think about ending their lives or try to hurt themselves.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Doctors sometimes give antidepressants to help young people feel better. These medicines can reduce feelings of sadness. But they can also increase thoughts about suicide in some cases. Researchers wanted to know which newer antidepressants work best. They also wanted to know if these medicines are safe.

**What did researchers hope to learn?**

The study looked at newer types of antidepressants. These are called ""new generation"" medicines. They do not include older types of antidepressants. Researchers wanted to see if these medicines help young people with depression. They also wanted to check for any harmful effects.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 26 studies that had already been done. These studies tested newer antidepressants on children and teens. All the young people in these studies had been told by a doctor they had major depressive disorder.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included children and teens between 6 and 18 years old. Both boys and girls were included. All of them had depression.

**What did researchers measure?**

Researchers looked at several things:
- Did depression symptoms get better?
- Did young people recover from depression?
- Could they do daily tasks more easily?
- Did they have thoughts about suicide?
- Did the medicines cause any unwanted effects?

Some young people got real medicine. Others got a placebo. A placebo looks like real medicine but has no active drug in it. This helps researchers see if the medicine really works.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

Most newer antidepressants work better than placebo. This means they reduce depression symptoms more than a dummy pill. However, the improvement is small. Young people, their parents, and doctors may not notice a big difference.

**Which medicines work best?**

When researchers compared different medicines, most worked about the same. There were only small differences between them. The study suggests these medicines may help some people:
- Sertraline
- Escitalopram
- Duloxetine
- Fluoxetine

Doctors can consider these medicines if they think medication might help.

**What are the risks?**

These medicines may increase thoughts about suicide in some young people. This is very important. Doctors must watch patients closely when they take these medicines. They need to check often for any signs of suicidal thoughts or behaviors.

**What does this mean for patients?**

Some young people may feel much better with these medicines. Others may not notice much change. The results show what happens on average. Each person is different. Some individuals may respond better than others.

Doctors should watch closely to see if the medicine helps. They should also check for any harmful effects. This is especially important for suicide-related thoughts and behaviors.

**What needs to happen next?**

The studies had some limits. They did not include many young people who:
- Were already thinking about suicide
- Were hurting themselves
- Had other mental health problems
- Had difficult life situations

Many young people who seek help have these problems. Future research needs to test these medicines on young people who are more like those who need treatment in real life.

**Key takeaway**

Newer antidepressants may help reduce depression in children and teens. But the benefit is often small. Close monitoring by doctors is essential. This is especially true for watching suicide-related thoughts and behaviors."
10.1002-14651858.CD013677.pub2-pls.txt,"Should we perform posterior reconstruction RALP or standard RALP for clinically localized prostate cancer? 
Review question 
In men with prostate cancer who are having their prostate removed using surgery assisted by a robotic device (called robotic‐assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy, or RALP), how does connecting the tissue behind the urethra (so‐called posterior reconstruction) compare to surgery where these connections are not made (standard RALP)? 
Background 
Urologists often use a robot to remove the prostate in men with prostate cancer. After surgery, most men leak urine for some time. This problem is called incontinence and usually improves six to 12 months after surgery in most men. However, it can be very bothersome during this time. 
Study characteristics 
We included eight studies in which chance determined whether men had posterior reconstruction RALP or standard RALP. These studies included 1085 men with an average age ranging from 60 to 67 years. The average prostate‐specific antigen (PSA) level in the men was 8.15 ng/mL. Higher levels of PSA may indicate worse prostate cancer. 
Key results 
We found that posterior reconstruction RALP may result in better continence one week after the catheter comes out compared to standard RALP (although it is also possible that it is no better), but it may make little to no difference at either three or 12 months after surgery. Posterior reconstruction RALP probably results in little to no difference in serious unwanted effects compared with the standard way of doing the surgery. There may also be little to no difference in positive surgical margins, meaning the risk of there being cancer cells right at the cut edge of the prostate when viewed under the microscope. There may also be no difference between the two techniques in terms of the risk of a PSA level that goes up within 12 months of surgery, which often signals that there is cancer left behind. We are very uncertain how posterior reconstruction RALP effects the ability to achieve an erection, compared to standard RALP. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low depending on the outcome, meaning that we have moderate to very little confidence in the results.

## Plain Title
Does Adding a Special Stitch During Robot-Assisted Prostate Surgery Help Men Control Their Urine Better?

## Rationale

**What is prostate cancer and why is this study important?**

Prostate cancer affects the prostate gland in men. When doctors treat this cancer, they often remove the prostate through surgery. Many doctors now use a robot to help them do this surgery. This is called robot-assisted surgery.

After prostate surgery, most men have trouble controlling their urine. This means urine leaks out when they do not want it to. Doctors call this problem incontinence. This leaking usually gets better after 6 to 12 months. But during that time, it can be very upsetting and affect daily life.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to test a different way of doing the surgery. This different way adds an extra step. During surgery, doctors connect tissue behind the tube that carries urine (called the urethra). They call this extra step ""posterior reconstruction."" It is like adding a special stitch to support the area.

Researchers thought this extra step might help men control their urine better after surgery. They wanted to compare this new way to the standard way of doing the surgery.

## Trial Design

**How was this study set up?**

Researchers looked at 8 different studies. These studies included 1,085 men total. The men were between 60 and 67 years old on average. All the men had prostate cancer.

In these studies, chance decided which surgery each man got. Some men got the surgery with the extra stitch (posterior reconstruction). Other men got the standard surgery without the extra stitch. This way of choosing by chance helps make the comparison fair.

Doctors measured a substance in the blood called PSA. The average PSA level was 8.15. Higher PSA numbers can mean the cancer is worse.

Researchers then watched the men after surgery. They checked how well the men could control their urine at different times. They also looked for other problems.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The study found several things:

**Urine control:**
One week after the catheter came out, men who had the extra stitch might have had better urine control. But the results were not clear. By 3 months and 12 months after surgery, both groups were about the same. The extra stitch did not make much difference in the long run.

**Safety:**
Both types of surgery seemed equally safe. There was little to no difference in serious side effects between the two groups.

**Cancer removal:**
Doctors looked at the edges of the removed prostate under a microscope. They checked if cancer cells were at the cut edges. This is called positive surgical margins. Both surgery types had similar results. This means the extra stitch did not affect how well doctors removed the cancer.

**Cancer coming back:**
Doctors checked PSA levels after surgery. If PSA goes up within 12 months, it often means cancer was left behind. Both surgery types had similar rates of rising PSA.

**Sexual function:**
Researchers were very unsure about how the extra stitch affected men's ability to get an erection. The studies did not give clear answers about this.

**What does this mean?**

The extra stitch during surgery might help with urine control in the very short term. But after a few months, it does not seem to make much difference. Both surgery types appear equally safe. The extra stitch does not seem to affect cancer removal or the chance of cancer coming back.

However, researchers said they are not completely confident in these results. More studies may be needed to be sure."
10.1002-14651858.CD013678.pub2-pls.txt,"The effectiveness of surgery for treating lamellar macular holes
Why is this question important?Lamellar macular holes are small partial‐thickness defects affecting the centre of the retina, called the macula. The retina is the layer at the back of the eye that detects light, and the macula is essential for detailed vision. It has been suggested that surgery can prevent vision loss (or improve vision) in people with lamellar macular holes, but there is no current consensus. We reviewed published research to determine whether surgery improves vision for people with a lamellar macular hole. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?First, we searched for randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), because these studies provide the most robust evidence about the effects of treatment. We then planned to compare the results, and summarise the evidence from the studies. Finally, we then aimed to rate our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and how similar the findings of the different studies were. 
What did we find?We found one study that involved a total of 36 people with a diagnosis of a lamellar macular hole. This study showed that people who underwent surgery may achieve better vision six months after their surgery compared with people who were observed without receiving surgery. However, limitations in the study design and its small size means that our confidence in the evidence was low. 
What does this mean?It remains unclear whether surgery is effective for people with lamellar macular holes. Further research is required. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to 20 July 2021. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Surgery for Lamellar Macular Holes

## Plain Title
Does Surgery Help People with Small Holes in the Center of the Eye?

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**

The macula is the center part of the retina. The retina is a layer at the back of your eye. It detects light so you can see. The macula helps you see fine details clearly.

A lamellar macular hole is a small defect in the macula. It does not go all the way through. It only goes part way through the macula. This condition can affect your detailed vision. It may cause vision loss over time.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors think surgery might help people with lamellar macular holes. Surgery might stop vision from getting worse. It might even make vision better. But doctors do not agree on this. Some doctors think surgery helps. Other doctors are not sure.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to know if surgery works better than no surgery. They looked at published studies to find the answer. They wanted to help doctors know the best way to treat patients.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This is a review of research studies. The researchers looked for a specific type of study. They wanted randomized controlled studies. In these studies, patients are put into groups by chance. Some patients get surgery. Other patients do not get surgery. This type of study gives the best evidence.

**Who was in the studies?**

The researchers found one study. This study had 36 people total. All of these people had a lamellar macular hole.

**How long did the study last?**

The study followed patients for six months after treatment.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The study showed that surgery might help. People who had surgery may have had better vision after six months. Their vision was better compared to people who did not have surgery.

**What are the limitations?**

The researchers have low confidence in these results. This means the findings might not be reliable. There are two main reasons:

First, the study was very small. It only had 36 people. Small studies do not always give accurate answers.

Second, the study had problems with how it was designed. These problems make the results less trustworthy.

**What do the results mean for patients?**

Right now, it is not clear if surgery really helps people with lamellar macular holes. The evidence is not strong enough to be sure. More research is needed to find the answer.

Doctors need better studies to know if they should recommend surgery. These studies should have more patients. They should also be designed more carefully.

**What comes next?**

Researchers need to do more studies. These studies should be larger. They should follow patients for longer periods of time. This will help doctors know the best way to treat lamellar macular holes.

**How current is this information?**

The researchers looked at all available evidence up to July 20, 2021. This review includes the most recent information available at that time.

Aim of this review 
We assessed the effect of sending targeted messages by mobile devices to pregnant women and parents of young children about health and healthcare services. 
Key messages 
There are gaps in the evidence regarding the effects of targeted messages by mobile devices to pregnant women and parents of young children about health and healthcare services. Some of these messages may improve some people's health and their use of health services, but others may make little or no difference. The existing evidence is mostly of low or very low certainty. 
What was studied in the review? 
Targeted client communication (TCC) is an intervention in which the health system sends information to particular people, based on their health status or other factors specific to that population group. Common types of TCC are text messages reminding people to attend appointments or that offer healthcare information and support. Our review assessed whether TCC can change pregnant women's and parents' behaviour, health service use, health, and well‐being. 
What happens when pregnant women receive targeted messages by mobile device? 
Compared to women who get no messages 
Women may breastfeed more in settings where exclusive breastfeeding is not common. They may also go to more antenatal care appointments. They may use skilled birth attendants more where this is less common. We do not know if the messages affect women's or babies' health because the certainty of the evidence is very low. 
Compared to women who get messages sent in other ways 
Women and newborns may have fewer health problems during the first 10 days after birth. The messages may make little or no difference to the number of women who breastfeed. We do not know if they make women use more health services. 
Compared to women who get untargeted messages 
The messages may make little or no difference to whether women get influenza vaccines during pregnancy. We do not know if the messages affect women's or babies' health or lead women to use skilled birth attendants more because the evidence is lacking or of very low certainty. 
What happens when pregnant women living with HIV receive targeted messages by mobile device? 
Compared to women who get no messages 
Women may go to slightly more antenatal care appointments. We do not know whether the messages lead more women to give birth in a health facility or improve babies' health because the evidence is of very low certainty. The messages may make little or no difference to whether pregnant women and babies follow antiretroviral (ARV) treatment (used to treat HIV) according to plan. We do not know if the messages affect women's health because the evidence is missing. 
Compared to women who get messages sent in other ways 
We do not know what the effect of these messages is because we lack evidence.
Compared to women who get untargeted messages 
More parents may follow their babies' ARV treatment according to plan. We do not know if the messages improve women's or babies' health or their use of services because the evidence is missing. 
What happens when parents of young children receive targeted messages by mobile device? 
Compared to parents who get no messages 
More parents may take their children to healthcare services such as vaccination appointments. But we do not know if the messages improve children's health or their health behaviour because the evidence is missing. 
Compared to parents who get messages sent in other ways 
Slightly more parents may take their children to vaccination appointments. The messages may make little or no difference to children's toothbrushing habits. We do not know if the messages affect children's health because the evidence is missing. 
Compared to parents who get untargeted messages 
Fewer parents may take their children to vaccination appointments, but this evidence is mixed. We do not know if the messages affect children's health due to lack of evidence.

","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Can Text Messages to Pregnant Women and Parents Help Improve Health and Use of Health Services?

## Rationale

### What is the health issue?
Pregnant women and parents of young children need to make many health care visits. They need to go to check-ups during pregnancy. They need to get their babies vaccinated. They need to know how to care for themselves and their children. Sometimes people miss appointments or don't know what to do to stay healthy.

### Why was this study needed?
Researchers wanted to know if sending messages through mobile phones could help. These messages would be made just for each person. The messages might remind people about appointments. They might give health tips. They might offer support. Mobile phones are common in many places. So sending messages this way could reach many people.

### What did researchers want to find out?
Researchers wanted to see if these phone messages work. Do they help pregnant women and parents use health services more? Do the messages improve health? Do they change health behaviors like breastfeeding?

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was a review study. Researchers looked at many other studies done before. They collected all the studies about mobile phone messages. They looked at studies done up to August 2017.

### Who was in the studies?
The studies included two main groups of people:
- Pregnant women (including women living with HIV)
- Parents of young children

### What did researchers compare?
Researchers compared different groups:
- People who got messages versus people who got no messages
- People who got messages by phone versus people who got messages another way
- People who got messages made just for them versus people who got general messages

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

**For pregnant women getting messages:**
- Women may breastfeed more. This was true in places where breastfeeding is not common.
- Women may go to more pregnancy check-ups.
- Women may use trained birth helpers more in places where this is less common.
- Women and newborns may have fewer health problems in the first 10 days after birth.
- Messages may not change how many women get flu vaccines during pregnancy.

**For pregnant women with HIV getting messages:**
- Women may go to slightly more pregnancy check-ups.
- More parents may follow their babies' HIV treatment plans correctly.
- Messages may not change whether women and babies follow HIV treatment plans.

**For parents of young children getting messages:**
- More parents may take their children to get vaccines.
- Messages may not change how often children brush their teeth.
- Some evidence showed fewer parents took children for vaccines. But this finding was mixed.

### What don't we know?
For many questions, researchers could not be sure about the answers. The evidence was weak or missing. We don't know for certain if messages:
- Improve the health of mothers and babies
- Make women use more health services in all cases
- Improve children's health

### What does this mean?
Some phone messages may help pregnant women and parents. They may help people use health services more. They may help with some health behaviors. But we need better studies to be more sure. Many questions still need answers.

### Why is the evidence uncertain?
The studies had problems. Some studies were small. Some were not done carefully. Different studies found different things. This makes it hard to know what really works.

10.1002-14651858.CD013693.pub2-pls.txt,"Screening tests for active pulmonary tuberculosis in children
Why is improving screening for pulmonary tuberculosis in children important? 
Tuberculosis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Most children who die from tuberculosis are never diagnosed or treated. Screening may be useful to identify children with possible tuberculosis and refer them for further testing. As well, screening could be used to identify children without tuberculosis, who should be considered for preventive treatment. A false‐positive result means that children may undergo unnecessary testing and treatment and may not receive preventive treatment promptly. A false‐negative result means that children have tuberculosis, but may miss further testing to confirm the diagnosis. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To determine the accuracy of screening tests for active pulmonary tuberculosis in children in high‐risk groups, such as children with HIV and close contacts of people with tuberculosis. 
What was studied in this review? 
Screening tests were: one tuberculosis symptom; one or more of a combination of tuberculosis symptoms; the World Health Organization (WHO) four‐symptom screen (one or more of cough, fever, poor weight gain, or tuberculosis contact) in children with HIV, recommended at each healthcare visit; chest radiography (CXR); and Xpert MTB/RIF. 
What are the main results in this review? 
Nineteen studies assessed the following screening tests: one symptom (15 studies, 10,097 participants); more than one symptom (12 studies, 29,889 participants); CXR (10 studies, 7146 participants); and Xpert MTB/RIF (two studies, 787 participants). 
Symptom screening 
For every 1000 children screened, if 50 had tuberculosis according to the reference standard: 
One or more of cough, fever, or poor weight gain in tuberculosis contacts (composite reference standard (CRS) (4 studies) 
– 339 would screen positive, of whom 294 (87%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive). 
– 661 would screen negative, of whom 5 (1%) would have tuberculosis (false negative).
One or more of cough, fever, or decreased playfulness in children under five, inpatient or outpatient (CRS) (3 studies) 
– 251 to 636 would screen positive, of whom 219 to 598 (87% to 94%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive). 
– 364 to 749 would screen negative, of whom 12 to 18 (2% to 3%) would have tuberculosis (false negative). 
One or more of cough, fever, poor weight gain, or tuberculosis close contact (WHO four‐symptom screen) in children with HIV, outpatient (CRS) (2 studies) 
– 88 would screen positive, of which 57 (65%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive).
– 912 would screen negative, of which 19 (2%) would have tuberculosis (false negative).
Abnormal CXR in tuberculosis contacts (CRS) (8 studies) 
– 63 would screen positive, of whom 19 (30%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive).
– 937 would screen negative, of whom 6 (1%) would have tuberculosis (false negative).
Xpert MTB/RIF in children, inpatient or outpatient microbiologic reference standard (MRS) (2 studies) 
– 31 to 69 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 9 to 19 (28% to 29%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive). 
– 931 to 969 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative, of whom 0 to 28 (0% to 3%) would have tuberculosis (false negative). 
How reliable are the results of the studies in this review? 
Diagnosing tuberculosis in children is difficult. This may lead to screening tests appearing more or less accurate than they actually are. For Xpert MTB/RIF, there were few studies and children tested to be confident about results. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Children at risk for pulmonary tuberculosis. Results likely do not apply to children in the general population. Studies mainly took place in countries with a high burden of tuberculosis. 
What are the implications of this review? 
In children who are tuberculosis contacts or living with HIV, screening tests using symptoms or CXR may be useful. However, symptoms and CXR formed part of the reference standard, which may falsely elevate the accuracy of the results. We urgently need better screening tests for tuberculosis in children to better identify children who should be considered for tuberculosis preventive treatment and to increase the timeliness of treatment in those with tuberculosis disease. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
To 14 February 2020.
","# Plain Language Summary: Screening Tests for Tuberculosis in Children

## Plain Title
How Well Do Screening Tests Find Tuberculosis in Children at High Risk?

## Rationale

**What is tuberculosis and why does it matter?**

Tuberculosis is a lung disease. It is one of the top causes of death around the world. Many children die from tuberculosis each year. Most of these children are never found to have the disease. They never get treatment.

**Why is screening important?**

Screening means checking children to see if they might have tuberculosis. Screening can help in two ways. First, it can find children who might have the disease. These children can then get more tests. Second, it can find children who do not have the disease. These children can get medicine to prevent tuberculosis.

**What problems can happen with screening?**

Sometimes a test says a child has tuberculosis when they do not. This is called a false positive. The child may get extra tests they do not need. They may not get prevention medicine right away.

Sometimes a test says a child does not have tuberculosis when they do. This is called a false negative. The child may miss getting the right tests and treatment.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors need to know which screening tests work best. This study looked at how well different tests find tuberculosis in children. The children studied were at high risk. This means they live with HIV or have been near someone with tuberculosis.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at 19 other studies. They did not do new tests on children. They combined results from past studies.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included children at high risk for tuberculosis. Some children had HIV. Some children had been close to people with tuberculosis. Most studies took place in countries where tuberculosis is common.

**What tests did the studies look at?**

The studies looked at several screening tests:
- Checking for one symptom like cough or fever
- Checking for more than one symptom at the same time
- A four-symptom check used by the World Health Organization
- Chest X-rays
- A lab test called Xpert MTB/RIF

**How many children were in the studies?**

Different numbers of children were in each group:
- One symptom: 10,097 children
- More than one symptom: 29,889 children
- Chest X-rays: 7,146 children
- Xpert MTB/RIF test: 787 children

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers looked at how many children each test found correctly. They also looked at how many mistakes each test made.

**Results for symptom checks:**

Imagine 1,000 children were screened. Of these, 50 actually have tuberculosis.

*Checking for cough, fever, or poor weight gain in children near someone with tuberculosis:*
- 339 children would test positive
- Of these, 294 do not actually have tuberculosis
- 661 children would test negative
- Of these, 5 actually have tuberculosis

*Checking for cough, fever, or less playfulness in young children:*
- 251 to 636 children would test positive
- Most of these (87% to 94%) do not have tuberculosis
- 12 to 18 children with tuberculosis would be missed

*Four-symptom check in children with HIV:*
- 88 children would test positive
- Of these, 57 do not have tuberculosis
- 19 children with tuberculosis would be missed

**Results for chest X-rays in children near someone with tuberculosis:**
- 63 children would test positive
- Of these, 19 do not have tuberculosis
- 6 children with tuberculosis would be missed

**Results for Xpert MTB/RIF lab test:**
- 31 to 69 children would test positive
- About 9 to 19 do not have tuberculosis
- 0 to 28 children with tuberculosis would be missed

**How reliable are these results?**

Finding tuberculosis in children is hard. This makes it difficult to know how accurate the tests really are. There were not many studies of the Xpert test. More research is needed.

**What do these results mean?**

Symptom checks and chest X-rays may help find tuberculosis in at-risk children. But these tests are not perfect. They miss some children who have the disease. They also say some children have the disease when they do not.

**What is the main conclusion?**

Better screening tests are urgently needed. Better tests would help doctors know which children need prevention medicine. Better tests would also help children with tuberculosis get treatment faster.

This review includes studies up to February 2020."
10.1002-14651858.CD013694.pub2-pls.txt,"How accurate are sputum Xpert tests for screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults whether or not they have tuberculosis symptoms? 
Why is using Xpert tests to screen for pulmonary tuberculosis important? 
Tuberculosis is the leading cause of infectious disease‐related death and one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using specific rapid tests as initial tests for diagnosing tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in people with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis. However, the WHO estimates that nearly one‐third of all active tuberculosis cases go undiagnosed and unreported. Not recognizing tuberculosis when it is present (a false negative test result) may result in illness and death and an increased risk of infecting others. An incorrect diagnosis of tuberculosis (false‐positive result) may mean that people are given antibiotics when there is no benefit to be gained. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To estimate the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra as screening tests for pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults whether or not they have tuberculosis symptoms (such as cough, fever, weight loss, and night sweats). We were interested in how the tests worked in groups at high risk for tuberculosis, including people living with HIV (PLHIV), household contacts of people with tuberculosis, miners, people residing in prisons, people with diabetes, and in the general public. 
What was studied in this review? 
Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra are rapid tests for simultaneously diagnosing tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. We combined study results to determine: 
‐ sensitivity: people with tuberculosis (rifampicin resistance) correctly diagnosed as having the condition. 
‐ specificity: people without tuberculosis (rifampicin resistance) correctly identified as not having the condition. 
The closer sensitivity and specificity are to 100%, the better the test.
What are the main results in this review? 
Twenty‐one studies: 18 studies (13,114 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF as a screening test for pulmonary tuberculosis and one study (571 participants) evaluated both Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra. Three studies (159 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance. 
For every 1000 people tested, if 50 had tuberculosis according to the reference standard:
PLHIV 
‐ Xpert MTB/RIF (12 studies):
· 40 people would test positive, including 9 without tuberculosis (62% sensitivity)
· 960 people would test negative, including 19 with tuberculosis (99% specificity)
‐ Xpert Ultra (1 study):
· 53 people would test positive, including 19 without tuberculosis (69% sensitivity)
· 947 people would test negative, including 16 with tuberculosis (98% specificity)
For every 1000 people tested, if 10 had tuberculosis according to the reference standard:
Other high‐risk groups combined 
‐ Xpert MTB/RIF (5 studies):
· 19 people would test positive, including 12 without tuberculosis (69% sensitivity)
· 981 people would test negative, including 3 with tuberculosis (99% specificity)
For detection of rifampicin resistance, Xpert MTB/RIF sensitivity was 81% and 100% (2 studies) and specificity was 94% to 100% (3 studies). 
How reliable are the results of the studies in this review? 
In the included studies, the reference standards for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis (culture) and rifampicin resistance (drug susceptibility testing) are likely to have been reliable methods for deciding whether patients really had the conditions. We were fairly confident in the results for Xpert MTB/RIF in PLHIV, and less so for other high‐risk groups. Not enough people have been studied to be confident about the results for Xpert Ultra or for detection of rifampicin resistance. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies were mainly performed in high tuberculosis and high HIV burden settings. No studies evaluated the tests in people with diabetes mellitus or the general population. 
What are the implications of this review? 
In PLHIV, Xpert MTB/RIF as a screening test was accurate for tuberculosis in high tuberculosis burden settings. In high‐risk groups, Xpert MTB/RIF may assist in identifying tuberculosis, but the certainty of evidence is low. In PLHIV, Xpert Ultra sensitivity was slightly higher than that of Xpert MTB/RIF and specificity similar based on one study. There were few studies and few people tested for rifampicin resistance and no studies that evaluated the tests in people with diabetes or in the general population.

## Plain Title
How Well Do Xpert Sputum Tests Find Tuberculosis and Drug Resistance in Adults at High Risk?

## Rationale

**What is tuberculosis and why is it important?**

Tuberculosis is a lung disease. It kills more people than any other germ-caused illness in the world. It spreads from person to person through the air.

**What is the problem?**

About 1 in 3 people with tuberculosis never get diagnosed. When doctors miss tuberculosis, sick people can die. They can also spread the disease to others. Some tuberculosis germs resist common drugs. Doctors need to know this to give the right treatment.

**Why was this study needed?**

Some people have a higher chance of getting tuberculosis. This includes people living with HIV, people who live with someone who has tuberculosis, miners, prisoners, and people with diabetes. Doctors need good tests to find tuberculosis early in these high-risk groups. The Xpert tests are fast tests. They can find tuberculosis and drug resistance in just a few hours. This study looked at how well these tests work for screening people who may or may not have symptoms.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know if Xpert tests could accurately find tuberculosis in high-risk adults. They also wanted to know if the tests could find drug-resistant tuberculosis.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at 21 other studies done by different teams. They combined the results to see the big picture.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included over 13,000 adults. Most were people living with HIV. Others included household contacts of tuberculosis patients, miners, and prisoners. The studies took place mostly in countries where tuberculosis and HIV are common.

**What tests were studied?**

Two tests were studied: Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra. Both tests use sputum samples. Sputum is the mucus people cough up from their lungs. The tests look for tuberculosis germs and check if the germs resist a key drug called rifampicin.

**How did researchers measure accuracy?**

Researchers looked at two things:
- Sensitivity: How many people with tuberculosis did the test find?
- Specificity: How many people without tuberculosis did the test correctly identify as healthy?

## Results

**What were the main findings?**

**For people living with HIV:**

Imagine 1,000 people get tested. If 50 actually have tuberculosis:
- Xpert MTB/RIF found 31 of the 50 people with tuberculosis. It missed 19 people.
- The test wrongly said 9 healthy people had tuberculosis.
- Xpert Ultra found 34 of the 50 people with tuberculosis. It missed 16 people.
- Xpert Ultra wrongly said 19 healthy people had tuberculosis.

**For other high-risk groups:**

Imagine 1,000 people get tested. If 10 actually have tuberculosis:
- Xpert MTB/RIF found 7 of the 10 people with tuberculosis. It missed 3 people.
- The test wrongly said 12 healthy people had tuberculosis.

**For drug resistance:**

The Xpert MTB/RIF test found most cases of drug resistance. It correctly identified healthy people most of the time. However, only a few studies looked at this.

**How reliable are these results?**

The results for Xpert MTB/RIF in people living with HIV are fairly reliable. The results for other groups are less certain. Not enough people were tested with Xpert Ultra to be very confident about those results.

**What does this mean for patients?**

In people living with HIV, Xpert MTB/RIF works well as a screening test. It can help find tuberculosis early. Xpert Ultra may find slightly more cases. Both tests are very good at correctly identifying people without tuberculosis.

For other high-risk groups, the tests may help find tuberculosis. But more research is needed.

**What is still unknown?**

No studies looked at these tests in people with diabetes. No studies looked at screening the general public. More research is needed for drug resistance testing.

**Conclusion:**

Xpert tests can help find tuberculosis in high-risk adults. They work best in people living with HIV. The tests are fast and fairly accurate. They can help doctors start treatment sooner and prevent spread of the disease."

Key messages· We did not find enough evidence to show how well antibiotics taken by mouth can treat long‐lasting blepharitis. 
· One antibiotic tested may improve some clinical aspects (symptoms and course of the disease), but we are uncertain about its benefit in this respect, and it may also cause a higher number of unwanted effects. 
· More studies are needed to find out how well antibiotics taken by mouth can treat long‐lasting blepharitis. 
What is blepharitis?Blepharitis is a common condition affecting the eyes. It causes swelling and redness on the edges of the eyelids, making them feel sore, and an itching or a gritty feeling in the eyes. The most common causes of blepharitis are infection by a type of bacteria that lives on the surface of the eye, or skin conditions such as dermatitis. 
How is blepharitis treated?Blepharitis is usually treated by regularly cleaning the eyelids, or using a cream or eye drops containing an antibiotic (a type of medicine that kills bacteria). If these do not work, then taking antibiotics by mouth (orally) is often tried. However, there are no guidelines about which type of antibiotic to give, what dose to use, or how long treatment should last. 
What did we want to find out?We wanted to find out how well antibiotics given by mouth can treat long‐lasting blepharitis. 
What did we do?We searched for studies that tested antibiotics given by mouth to treat long‐lasting blepharitis. 
What did we find?We found 2 studies in 220 adults with long‐lasting blepharitis. One study took place in the USA and lasted for three months; it tested the antibiotic doxycycline compared to placebo treatment (a 'dummy' treatment that does not contain any medicine but looks identical to the medicine being tested). The other study took place in South Korea and tested the effects of high or low doses of doxycycline compared to placebo treatment. 
One study was funded by a pharmaceutical company; the other study did not report a source of funding. The studies measured results of treatment in different ways, so it was not possible to combine the studies' results to analyse them together. 
What are the main results of our review?We are uncertain about the effects of doxycycline on symptoms such as itching, burning, and watery eyes, as evaluated by people taking part in the studies. 
One study measured changes in how much an affected eye watered (produced tears) before and after one month of treatment. High‐ and low‐dose doxycycline may improve the eye's ability to produce tears (evidence from 1 study with 93 people in each dose group). 
One study evaluated dryness of the eye by measuring the time it took for a dry spot to appear on the surface of the eye after blinking (the 'tear film break‐up time'). Taking doxycycline (high‐ and low‐dose) for one month may improve problems with dryness (evidence from 1 study with 93 people in each dose group). 
Taking doxycycline for one month may cause more unwanted effects than taking a placebo (evidence from 1 study in 139 people). The number of unwanted effects reported was higher in the high‐dose doxycycline group. 
No studies measured:
· how many bacteria were present in the eye before or after treatment;
· people's well‐being (quality of life); or
· the costs and benefits of the treatments tested.
What are the limitations of the evidence?We have very low confidence in the evidence because of limitations in the ways the studies were conducted, and because the results of the studies varied widely and were inconsistent. One study was funded by a pharmaceutical company, which could have affected the way the study was designed, conducted, and reported. Further research is likely to change and increase our confidence in the results. 
How up‐to‐date is the evidence?The evidence is current up to 29 August 2020. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing Antibiotics Taken by Mouth for Long-Lasting Swollen Eyelids

## Plain Title

Can antibiotics taken by mouth help treat long-lasting swollen and itchy eyelids?

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**

Blepharitis is a common eye problem. It causes the edges of the eyelids to become red and swollen. People with this condition often feel soreness in their eyelids. Their eyes may itch or feel gritty, like sand is in them.

**What causes it?**

Two main things cause blepharitis. First, bacteria that live on the eye surface can cause infection. Second, skin conditions like dermatitis can trigger it.

**Why is this a problem?**

Blepharitis makes daily life hard for patients. The constant itching and soreness are uncomfortable. The gritty feeling in the eyes is bothersome.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors usually treat blepharitis by having patients clean their eyelids regularly. They may also prescribe antibiotic creams or eye drops. These treatments kill bacteria. When these do not work, doctors often try antibiotics taken by mouth. However, doctors do not have clear guidelines. They do not know which antibiotic works best. They do not know what dose to give. They do not know how long treatment should last.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to find out if antibiotics taken by mouth can treat long-lasting blepharitis. They wanted to know if these medicines help patients feel better.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked for all studies that tested mouth antibiotics for long-lasting blepharitis. They found 2 studies.

**Who was in the studies?**

Both studies included adults with long-lasting blepharitis. In total, 220 people took part.

**What did the studies test?**

Both studies tested an antibiotic called doxycycline. One study compared doxycycline to a placebo. A placebo is a dummy pill that looks like real medicine but contains no active drug. The other study tested high doses and low doses of doxycycline. It also compared these to a placebo.

**Where did the studies take place?**

One study was done in the USA. The other was done in South Korea.

**How long did the studies last?**

One study lasted three months. The other study measured results after one month of treatment.

**Who paid for the studies?**

One drug company paid for one study. The other study did not say who paid for it.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers could not combine the results from both studies. This is because the studies measured different things in different ways.

**Did doxycycline help with symptoms?**

The researchers are not sure if doxycycline helps with itching, burning, or watery eyes. The evidence was not clear enough.

**Did doxycycline help the eyes make tears?**

One study looked at how well eyes could make tears. Both high and low doses of doxycycline may help eyes produce tears better. This was measured after one month. The study included 93 people in each dose group.

**Did doxycycline help with eye dryness?**

One study checked how long it took for a dry spot to appear on the eye after blinking. Both high and low doses of doxycycline may help with dryness problems. This was measured after one month. The study included 93 people in each dose group.

**Were there unwanted effects?**

Taking doxycycline for one month may cause more unwanted effects than taking a placebo. This finding came from one study with 139 people. People taking high doses had more unwanted effects.

**What was not measured?**

The studies did not measure several important things. They did not count bacteria in the eye before or after treatment. They did not ask about quality of life. They did not look at treatment costs.

**What do the results mean?**

The researchers do not have enough evidence to say how well mouth antibiotics work for long-lasting blepharitis. Doxycycline may help with some problems like tear production and dryness. However, it may also cause more unwanted effects. More studies are needed to be sure about these findings.

**Why might these results be uncertain?**

The researchers have very low confidence in the evidence. The studies had problems with how they were done. The results varied a lot between studies. One drug company paid for one study, which could affect the results. More research will likely change these findings.

**How current is this information?**

The researchers looked for studies up to August 29, 2020."
10.1002-14651858.CD013699-pls.txt,"Are digital contact tracing technologies effective during infectious disease outbreaks?
Why is this question important? 
The global COVID‐19 pandemic highlights the importance of accurate and timely contact tracing. Contact tracing tells people that they may have been near someone with ‐ or showing symptoms of ‐ an infectious disease, allowing them to self‐isolate and helping to stop the spread of infection. Traditionally, contact tracing begins with notification that someone has an infectious disease. They are asked to recall their contacts, going back two to three days before symptom onset. This is time‐consuming and may not always give a complete picture, so digital aids could help contact tracers. 
Digital contact tracing uses technology to track and trace contacts. Individuals download an app onto their smartphones and record location and symptom information, or their devices might use location‐finding technology, like Bluetooth or GPS (global positioning system). If the user is infected, the technology identifies close contacts and/or secondary infections (people to whom they passed the disease), and informs people whom they have been near. The technology identifies where the infection was passed on and its duration (the context). 
However, problems may occur where access to technology is limited, in low‐income settings or for elderly people, for example. Also, some people see it as an invasion of privacy and are suspicious of how their data will be used. 
We wanted to know whether digital contact tracing, compared to manual contact tracing, is effective in reducing the spread of infection, as measured by secondary infections, identifying close contacts, tracing a complete set of contacts, and identifying the context of infection. 
What did we do? 
We searched medical databases for studies that assessed digital contact tracing. We preferred studies set during infectious disease outbreaks, which assessed real people in real time, but we included studies in any setting and of any design. 
To answer our question quickly, we shortened some steps of the Cochrane review process, however, we are confident in our conclusions. 
What we found 
We found 12 relevant studies. Six assessed the effectiveness of digital contact tracing on specific groups (cohorts) of people: three during an outbreak (Ebola in Sierra Leone; tuberculosis in Botswana; and whooping cough (pertussis) in USA); and three replicated an outbreak in schools to assess systems for identifying close contacts of participants. The remaining six were modelling studies, which simulated digital contact tracing. 
Main results 
Digital contact tracing with self‐isolation probably reduces the number of secondary infections, but not as much as manual contact tracing with self‐isolation (2 modelling studies). 
Digital contact tracing found more close contacts in two outbreaks than manual (2 studies in USA and Sierra Leone). Devices in non‐outbreak settings can identify more close contacts than self‐reported diaries or surveys. 
An app may reduce the time to complete a set of close contacts (1 study). Digital systems were faster to use than paper systems for recording new contacts and monitoring known contacts, and possibly less prone to data loss. 
Problems with system access (2 studies) included patchy network coverage, lack of data, technical problems and higher staff training needs. Contact tracers' personal expenses increased (1 study) due to travel and recharging phone batteries. Devices all appeared to protect diagnosed users from contacts, snoopers and authorities but one app's users were members of public health agencies. Studies recorded stolen hardware (second‐hand mobile phones); reported that paper forms were ""often lost"", and that digital data were password protected (2 studies) and encrypted (1 study). 
We found no evidence on contextual information and acceptability.
What this means 
It is unlikely that digital technologies would be the sole method of contact tracing during an outbreak; they would probably be used alongside manual methods. Unfortunately, the technology is largely unproven in real‐world outbreak settings and none of our included studies assessed digital plus manual contact tracing with digital contact tracing alone. Our included studies assessed different technologies and used different methods from each other, so we are uncertain about their evidence. 
Governments that implement digital contact tracing should ensure that at‐risk populations are not disadvantaged and take privacy concerns into account. 
This review is up to date to May 2020.
","# Plain Language Summary: Digital Contact Tracing During Disease Outbreaks

## Plain Title
Do Phone Apps and Digital Tools Help Track People Who May Have Been Exposed to Infectious Diseases?

## Rationale

### What is contact tracing and why does it matter?

When someone gets sick with an infectious disease, they can spread it to others. Contact tracing helps find people who were near the sick person. These people can then stay home to avoid spreading the disease further.

### How does traditional contact tracing work?

Normally, health workers ask sick people to remember who they saw. This goes back 2 to 3 days before they felt sick. This method takes a lot of time. People may also forget some contacts.

### What is digital contact tracing?

Digital contact tracing uses phones and apps to help track contacts. People download an app on their phone. The app records where they go and who they are near. It uses tools like Bluetooth or GPS to track location.

If someone gets sick, the app can tell others they were nearby. The app can show where people met and for how long.

### What problems might digital tracing have?

Some people do not have smartphones or internet access. This includes people with low income and some older adults. Some people worry about their privacy. They do not trust how their personal information will be used.

### Why was this study needed?

Researchers wanted to know if digital contact tracing works better than manual tracing. They looked at whether it could reduce the spread of disease. They checked if it could find more contacts faster. They wanted to see if it worked in real disease outbreaks.

## Trial Design

### How is this study designed?

This was not a single study. Instead, researchers looked at many different studies together. They searched medical databases for studies about digital contact tracing.

### What types of studies did they include?

They found 12 studies total. Six studies looked at real groups of people. Three of these happened during actual disease outbreaks. These outbreaks were Ebola in Sierra Leone, tuberculosis in Botswana, and whooping cough in the USA. Three other studies tested tracking systems in schools.

The remaining six studies used computer models. These studies created pretend outbreaks to test how digital tracing might work.

### Who was included?

The studies included different types of people. Some were adults during real outbreaks. Others were students in schools. The studies did not focus on specific ages or genders.

### How long did studies last?

The review does not give specific time lengths. Different studies lasted different amounts of time.

## Results

### What were the main results?

**Finding contacts:** Digital tracing found more close contacts than manual tracing in two outbreaks. Digital devices found more contacts than when people wrote down contacts in diaries.

**Reducing disease spread:** Digital tracing with staying home probably reduces new infections. However, it does not work as well as manual tracing with staying home. This finding came from 2 computer model studies.

**Speed:** One app may have reduced the time needed to find all close contacts. Digital systems were faster than paper for recording new contacts. They were also faster for checking on known contacts. Digital systems probably lost less data than paper systems.

**Problems found:** Some areas had poor phone network coverage. Some people lacked internet data. Technical problems occurred. Staff needed more training to use digital systems. In one study, contact tracers spent more personal money. They paid for travel and phone charging.

**Privacy and security:** Most devices protected user information from other people and authorities. However, one app's users were public health workers. Some phones were stolen. Paper forms were often lost. Two studies used password protection. One study encrypted data.

**Missing information:** Researchers found no studies about how acceptable digital tracing is to users. They found no information about identifying where infections spread.

### What do these results mean?

Digital tools would likely work alongside manual tracing, not replace it. The technology is mostly unproven in real outbreaks. No studies compared using both digital and manual methods together versus digital alone.

Different studies tested different technologies in different ways. This makes it hard to draw firm conclusions.

### What should governments do?

Governments using digital contact tracing should help people without technology access. They should address privacy concerns. They should make sure no groups are left behind.

### When was this review completed?

This review includes studies published up to May 2020."
10.1002-14651858.CD013705.pub3-pls.txt,"How accurate are rapid antigen tests for diagnosing COVID‐19?
Key messages 
• Rapid antigen tests are most accurate when they are used in people who have signs or symptoms of COVID‐19, especially during the first week of illness. People who test negative may still be infected. 
• Rapid antigen tests are considerably less accurate when they are used in people with no signs or symptoms of infection, but do perform better in people who have been in contact with someone who has confirmed COVID‐19. 
• The accuracy of rapid antigen tests varies between tests that are produced by different manufacturers and there is a lack of evidence for many commercially available tests. 
What are rapid point‐of‐care antigen tests for COVID‐19? 
Rapid point‐of‐care tests aim to confirm or rule out COVID‐19 infection in people with or without COVID‐19 symptoms. They: 
• are portable, so they can be used wherever the patient is (at the point‐of‐care) or in non‐healthcare settings such as in the home; 
• are easy to perform, with a minimum amount of extra equipment or complicated preparation steps; 
• are less expensive than standard laboratory tests;
• do not require a specialist operator or setting; and
• provide results ‘while you wait’.
For this review we were interested in rapid antigen tests, sometimes referred to as ‘lateral flow tests’. These tests identify proteins on the virus in samples taken from the nose or throat. They come in disposable plastic cassettes, similar to over‐the‐counter pregnancy tests. 
Why is this question important? 
People with suspected COVID‐19 need to know quickly whether they are infected, so that they can self‐isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. Currently, COVID‐19 infection is confirmed by a laboratory test called RT‐PCR, which uses specialist equipment and often takes at least 24 hours to produce a result. 
In many places, rapid antigen tests have opened access to testing for many more people, with and without symptoms, and in locations other than healthcare settings. Faster diagnosis of COVID‐19 infection could allow people to take appropriate action more quickly, with the potential to reduce the spread of COVID‐19, but it is important to understand how accurate they are and the best way to use them. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether commercially available, rapid point‐of‐care antigen tests are accurate enough to diagnose COVID‐19 infection reliably, and to find out if accuracy differs in people with and without symptoms. 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies that measured the accuracy of any commercially produced rapid antigen test in people who were also tested for COVID‐19 using RT‐PCR. People could be tested in hospital, in the community or in their own homes. Studies could test people with or without symptoms. 
What did we find? 
We included 155 studies in the review. The main results are based on 152 studies investigating a total of 100,462 nose or throat samples; COVID‐19 was confirmed in 16,822 of these samples. Studies investigated 49 different antigen tests. Around 60% of studies took place in Europe. 
Main results 
In people with confirmed COVID‐19, antigen tests correctly identified COVID‐19 infection in an average of 73% of people with symptoms, compared to 55% of people without symptoms. Tests were most accurate when used in the first week after symptoms began (an average of 82% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). This is likely to be because people have the most virus in their system in the first days after they are infected. For people with no symptoms, tests were most accurate in people likely to have been in contact with a case of COVID‐19 infection (an average of 64% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). 
In people who did not have COVID‐19, antigen tests correctly ruled out infection in 99.6% of people with symptoms and 99.7% of people without symptoms. 
Different brands of tests varied in accuracy. Summary results (combined from more than one study per test brand) for seven tests met World Health Organization (WHO) standards as ‘acceptable’ for confirming and ruling out COVID‐19 in people with signs and symptoms of COVID‐19. Two more tests met the WHO acceptable standard in one study each. No test met this standard when evaluated in people without symptoms. 
Using summary results for symptomatic people tested during the first week after symptoms began, if 1000 people with symptoms had the antigen test, and 50 (5%) of them really had COVID‐19: 
• 45 people would test positive for COVID‐19. Of these, 5 people (11%) would not have COVID‐19 (false positive result). 
• 955 people would test negative for COVID‐19. Of these, 10 people (1.0%) would actually have COVID‐19 (false negative result). 
In people with no symptoms of COVID‐19 the number of confirmed cases is expected to be much lower than in people with symptoms. Using summary results for people with no known exposure to COVID‐19 in a bigger population of 10,000 people with no symptoms, where 50 (0.5%) of them really had COVID‐19: 
• 62 people would test positive for COVID‐19. Of these, 30 people (48%) would not have COVID‐19 (false positive result). 
• 9938 people would test negative for COVID‐19. Of these, 18 people (0.2%) would actually have COVID‐19 (false negative result). 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
In general, studies used relatively rigorous methods, particularly for selecting participants and performing the tests. Sometimes studies did not perform the test on the people for whom it was intended and did not follow the manufacturers’ instructions for using the test. Sometimes the tests were not carried out at the point of care. Studies used less rigorous methods for confirming the presence or absence of COVID‐19 infection; 91% of studies relied on a single negative RT‐PCR result as evidence of no COVID‐19 infection. Results from different test brands varied, and relatively few studies directly compared one test brand with another. Finally, not all studies gave enough information about their participants for us to judge how long they had had symptoms, or even whether or not they had symptoms. 
What does this mean? 
In people with symptoms, some rapid antigen tests are accurate enough to replace RT‐PCR, especially for ruling in the presence of infection. Alternatively, where RT‐PCR is available, rapid antigen tests could be used to select which people with symptoms require further testing with RT‐PCR, thereby reducing the burden on laboratory services. This would be most useful when quick decisions are needed about patient care, to identify outbreaks, to allow people to self‐isolate more quickly, or to initiate contact tracing. Rapid antigen tests are less good at ruling out infection in symptomatic people ‐ individuals who receive a negative rapid antigen test result may still be infected. 
Rapid antigen tests are less accurate when used in people with no symptoms of COVID‐19. More evidence is needed to understand the accuracy of rapid testing in people without symptoms and the extent to which repeated testing strategies can lead to reduced transmission, either for tests carried out at home or in non‐healthcare settings such as schools. There is no independent evidence to support the use of many test brands. More direct comparisons of test brands are needed, with testers following manufacturers’ instructions. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
This review updates our previous review and includes evidence published up to 8 March 2021. 
","# Plain Language Summary: How Well Do Rapid COVID-19 Tests Work?

## Plain Title
How Accurate Are Rapid Antigen Tests for Finding COVID-19?

## Rationale

**What is COVID-19 and why does testing matter?**

COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus. People with COVID-19 need to know quickly if they are sick. This helps them stay home and not spread the virus to others. It also helps them get treatment.

**What are rapid antigen tests?**

Rapid antigen tests are quick COVID-19 tests. They look for parts of the virus in your nose or throat. You can use them at home or at a doctor's office. They give results in minutes, not hours or days. They look like home pregnancy tests.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

The main COVID-19 test is called RT-PCR. It is very accurate but takes at least 24 hours. It also needs special lab equipment. Rapid tests are faster and easier to use. But doctors need to know how well they work. This study looked at how often rapid tests give the right answer.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know if rapid antigen tests work well enough. They also wanted to know if the tests work better in people with symptoms or without symptoms.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at 155 other studies. These studies tested 100,462 people in total. About 16,822 of these people had COVID-19.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included people with and without COVID-19 symptoms. Some people were tested at hospitals. Others were tested at home or in their community. Most studies happened in Europe.

**What did the studies test?**

The studies looked at 49 different brands of rapid antigen tests. All people also got an RT-PCR test. This helped show if the rapid test was right or wrong.

**How long did the studies last?**

The review looked at studies published up to March 8, 2021.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The tests worked better in people with symptoms than in people without symptoms.

**For people with symptoms:**

The tests found COVID-19 in 73 out of 100 people who had it. The tests worked best in the first week of illness. During this time, they found 82 out of 100 people who had COVID-19.

The tests correctly said ""no COVID-19"" in 996 out of 1,000 people who did not have it.

**For people without symptoms:**

The tests found COVID-19 in only 55 out of 100 people who had it. The tests worked better in people who had been near someone with COVID-19. In these people, tests found 64 out of 100 cases.

The tests correctly said ""no COVID-19"" in 997 out of 1,000 people who did not have it.

**What do these numbers mean in real life?**

Imagine 1,000 people with symptoms get tested. If 50 of them have COVID-19:
- 45 people would test positive
- Of these 45, about 5 would not really have COVID-19
- 955 people would test negative
- Of these 955, about 10 would actually have COVID-19

Now imagine 10,000 people without symptoms get tested. If 50 of them have COVID-19:
- 62 people would test positive
- Of these 62, about 30 would not really have COVID-19
- 9,938 people would test negative
- Of these, about 18 would actually have COVID-19

**Did all test brands work the same?**

No. Different brands gave different results. Seven test brands met World Health Organization standards for people with symptoms. No test met these standards for people without symptoms.

**What are the main conclusions?**

Rapid antigen tests work well for people with symptoms, especially in the first week. They are good at finding COVID-19 when it is there. They are also good at ruling it out.

The tests do not work as well for people without symptoms. People who test negative might still have COVID-19.

These tests can help doctors decide who needs more testing. They can also help people know when to stay home. This can slow the spread of COVID-19.

**What else is needed?**

More research is needed on testing people without symptoms. More studies should compare different test brands. More evidence is needed for many test brands that are sold in stores."
10.1002-14651858.CD013717.pub2-pls.txt,"Can international travel‐related control measures contain the spread of the COVID‐19 pandemic? 
What are international travel‐related control measures? 
International travel control measures are methods to manage international travel to contain the spread of COVID‐19. Measures include: 
‐ closing international borders to stop travellers crossing from one country to another;
‐ restricting travel to and from certain countries, particularly those with high infection levels; 
‐ screening or testing travellers entering or leaving a country if they have symptoms or have been in contact with an infected person; 
‐ quarantining newly‐arrived travellers from another country, that is, requiring travellers to stay at home or in a specific place for a certain time. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out how effective international travel‐related control measures are in containing the COVID‐19 pandemic. 
What we did 
We searched for studies on the effects of these measures on the spread of COVID‐19. Studies had to report how many cases these measures prevented or detected, or whether they changed the course of the pandemic. The studies could include people of any age, anywhere. They could be of any design including those that used ‘real‐life’ data (observational studies) or hypothetical data from computer‐generated simulations (modelling studies). 
This is the first update of our review. This update includes only studies on COVID‐19, published up to 13 November 2020. 
What we found 
We found 62 studies. Most (49 studies) were modelling studies; only 13 used real‐life data (observational studies). Studies took place across the world and at different times during the pandemic. Levels of COVID‐19 within countries varied. 
Most studies compared current travel‐related control measures with no travel‐related controls. However, some modelling studies also compared current measures against possible measures, for example, to see what might happen if controls were more or less relaxed or were combined with other measures. 
Main results 
Below we summarise the findings of some outcomes.
Travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross‐border travel (31 modelling studies) 
Most studies showed that travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross‐border travel were beneficial, but this beneficial effect ranged from small to large. Additionally, some studies found no effect. Studies also predicted that these restrictions would delay the outbreak, but the delay ranged from one day to 85 days in different studies. 
Screening at borders (13 modelling studies and 13 observational studies) 
These studies assessed screening at borders, including screening people with symptoms or who had potentially been exposed to COVID‐19, or testing people, before or after they travelled. 
For screening based on symptoms or potential exposure to COVID‐19, modelling studies found that screening reduced imported or exported cases and delayed outbreaks. Modelling studies predicted that 1% to 53% of cases would be detected. Observational studies reported a wide range of cases detected, from 0% to 100%, with the majority of studies reporting less than 54% of cases detected. 
For screening based on testing, studies reported that testing travellers reduced imported or exported cases, and cases detected. Observational studies reported that the proportion of cases detected varied from 58% to 90%. This variation might be due to the timing of testing. 
Quarantine (12 modelling studies) 
All studies suggested that quarantine may be beneficial, but the size of this effect ranged from small to large in the different studies. Modelling studies, for example, predicted that quarantine could lead to between 450 and over 64,000 fewer cases in the community. Differences in effects may depend on how long people were quarantined for and how well they followed the rules. 
Quarantine and screening at borders (7 modelling studies and 4 observational studies) 
For quarantine and screening at borders, most studies suggested some benefit, however the size of this effect differed between studies. For example, observational studies reported that between 68% and 92% of cases would be detected. Differences in effects may depend on how long people were quarantined for and how often they were tested while in quarantine. 
How reliable are these results? 
Our confidence in these results is limited. Most studies were based on mathematical predictions (modelling), so we lack real‐life evidence. Further, we were not confident that models used correct assumptions, so our confidence in the evidence on travel restrictions and quarantine, in particular, is very low. Some studies were published quickly online as ‘preprints’. Preprints do not undergo the normal rigorous checks of published studies, so we are not certain how reliable they are. Also, the studies were very different from each other and their results varied according to the specification of each travel measure (e.g. the type of screening approach), how it was put into practice and enforced, the amount of cross‐border travel, levels of community transmission and other types of national measures to control the pandemic. 
What this means 
Overall, international travel‐related control measures may help to limit the spread of COVID‐19 across national borders. Restricting cross‐border travel can be a helpful measure. Screening travellers only for symptoms at borders is likely to miss many cases; testing may be more effective but may also miss cases if only performed upon arrival. Quarantine that lasts at least 10 days can prevent travellers spreading COVID‐19 and may be more effective if combined with another measure such as testing, especially if people follow the rules. 
Future research needs to be better reported. More studies should focus on real‐life evidence, and should assess potential benefits and risks of travel‐related control measures to individuals and society as a whole. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Can Travel Rules Between Countries Help Stop COVID-19 from Spreading?

## Plain Title
How Well Do Travel Rules Between Countries Work to Stop COVID-19 from Spreading?

## Rationale

### What is the problem?
COVID-19 is a disease that spreads from person to person. When people travel between countries, they can carry the virus with them. This can cause the disease to spread to new places. Countries need ways to stop or slow down this spread.

### What are travel control measures?
Countries can use different rules to control travel. These include:
- Closing borders so people cannot cross between countries
- Stopping travel from countries with many sick people
- Checking travelers for signs of illness
- Testing travelers to see if they have the virus
- Making travelers stay home or in one place for some time after they arrive (this is called quarantine)

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors and leaders need to know which travel rules work best. This helps them make good choices about how to protect people. The researchers wanted to find out if these travel rules really help stop COVID-19 from spreading.

## Trial Design

### How is this study designed?
This was not a single study. Instead, researchers looked for all studies about COVID-19 travel rules. They searched for studies published up to November 2020.

They found 62 studies from around the world. Most studies (49 studies) used computers to predict what might happen. Only 13 studies looked at real-life data.

The studies looked at people of all ages in different countries. They compared places that used travel rules with places that did not. Some studies also compared different types of travel rules.

This review looked at existing studies. It did not involve new patients or a set time period for participation.

## Results

### What were the main results?

**Stopping or reducing travel between countries:**
Researchers found 31 studies about this. Most studies showed that stopping travel helped reduce COVID-19 spread. The amount of help varied from small to large. Some studies found it delayed outbreaks by 1 to 85 days.

**Checking travelers at borders:**
Researchers found 26 studies about this. When countries checked people for symptoms or exposure, they found between 1 out of 100 and 53 out of 100 cases. Real-life studies found even more variation. Testing travelers worked better than just checking for symptoms. Real-life studies found that testing caught between 58 and 90 cases out of 100.

**Quarantine:**
Researchers found 12 studies about quarantine. All studies showed quarantine helped. The benefit ranged from 450 fewer cases to over 64,000 fewer cases. How well it worked depended on how long people stayed in quarantine and if they followed the rules.

**Quarantine plus checking at borders:**
Researchers found 11 studies about using both measures together. Most studies showed this combination helped. Real-life studies found it caught between 68 and 92 cases out of 100. This worked better when quarantine lasted longer and people were tested more often.

### What do these results mean?
Travel rules can help stop COVID-19 from spreading between countries. Stopping travel between countries can help. Just checking for symptoms misses many sick people. Testing works better but can still miss some cases if done only when people arrive. Quarantine for at least 10 days works well, especially when combined with testing.

### How reliable are these results?
The researchers have limited confidence in these results. Most studies used computer predictions, not real-life data. The studies were very different from each other. Results varied based on many factors like how rules were enforced and how much virus was already in each country.

More real-life studies are needed. Future research should look at both benefits and risks of travel rules for people and society."
10.1002-14651858.CD013720.pub3-pls.txt,"Antioxidants to prevent respiratory decline in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy
Review question 
What are the effects (benefits and harms) of antioxidants for preventing breathing problems becoming worse in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)? 
Background 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an inherited condition where boys show signs of muscle weakness in early childhood that become worse over time. The muscles used in breathing become involved, which leads to shortness of breath and the need for artificial ventilation (a machine to support breathing). Treatment with antioxidants has been proposed to slow down the loss of muscle strength and the decline in breathing. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the evidence up to 23 March 2021. We included two studies in boys with DMD whose breathing was affected. Both studies compared the antioxidant medicine idebenone with a dummy medicine. One study included 66 participants between 10 and 18 years of age. The participants in this study were not receiving corticosteroids (medicines shown to be beneficial in DMD). The other study involved 255 children with DMD who were also taking corticosteroids. This study was stopped early for lack of benefit. The full results of the study are not yet available. 
Study funding sources 
The studies were sponsored by Santhera Pharmaceuticals, the maker of idebenone.
Key results 
Idebenone may result in slightly less of a decline in forced vital capacity (a measure of lung capacity), but probably has little or no effect on quality of life in patients with worsening breathing. Idebenone may result in less of a decline in the ability to force air out of the lungs and airways (based on tests of forced expiratory volume in the first second and peak expiratory flow). Idebenone was associated with fewer serious side effects than the dummy drug and has little or no effect on non‐serious side effects. Idebenone may have little or no effect on muscle function (arm strength). We found no studies that looked at hospitalisation due to respiratory infection. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall certainty of the evidence was low. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Can Antioxidant Medicines Help Slow Down Breathing Problems in Boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy?

## Rationale

Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, is a disease that boys are born with. It passes from parents to their children through genes. Boys with DMD start to show signs of weak muscles when they are young children. Over time, their muscles get weaker and weaker.

As DMD gets worse, it affects the muscles that help with breathing. When breathing muscles get weak, boys may feel short of breath. They may need help from a breathing machine. This machine is called a ventilator. It helps push air in and out of the lungs.

Doctors wanted to test if antioxidant medicines could help. Antioxidants are substances that may protect the body's cells from damage. The idea was that antioxidants might slow down muscle loss. This could help boys with DMD breathe better for longer.

Researchers needed to find out if antioxidants really work for breathing problems in DMD. They also needed to know if these medicines are safe. This study looked at all the research done on this topic to find answers.

## Trial Design

Researchers looked for all studies that tested antioxidants in boys with DMD. They searched for studies up to March 2021. They found two studies that met their needs.

Both studies tested a medicine called idebenone. This is a type of antioxidant. The studies compared idebenone to a dummy medicine. A dummy medicine looks like the real medicine but has no active ingredients. Doctors call this a placebo.

One study had 66 boys in it. These boys were between 10 and 18 years old. All of them had DMD with breathing problems. These boys were not taking steroid medicines. Steroids are another type of medicine that can help with DMD.

The second study had 255 children with DMD. These children were taking steroid medicines along with the study medicine. However, this study stopped early. The researchers stopped it because the medicine did not seem to be helping. The full results from this study are not available yet.

Both studies were paid for by Santhera Pharmaceuticals. This is the company that makes idebenone.

## Results

The researchers found that idebenone may help a little bit with breathing. Boys who took idebenone had slightly less decline in their lung capacity. Lung capacity means how much air the lungs can hold. However, idebenone probably did not improve quality of life. Quality of life means how well boys felt in their daily activities.

Idebenone may also help boys push air out of their lungs better. The tests showed less decline in how fast and how much air boys could breathe out.

The medicine appeared to be safe. Boys who took idebenone had fewer serious side effects than boys who took the dummy medicine. Side effects are unwanted problems caused by medicine. Idebenone had little or no effect on minor side effects.

Idebenone may not help with muscle strength in the arms. The tests showed little or no difference in arm strength.

The researchers did not find any studies that looked at hospital stays for lung infections.

The quality of this evidence was low. This means we cannot be completely sure about these results. More research is needed to know for certain if idebenone helps boys with DMD.

In conclusion, idebenone may slow down some breathing problems in boys with DMD. However, the benefits appear to be small. The medicine seems safe to use. Doctors and families need more information before deciding if this medicine is right for each boy."
10.1002-14651858.CD013724.pub2-pls.txt,"How accurate are remote, virtual assessments at diagnosing dementia?
Why is this question important? 
Dementia is a chronic and progressive condition that affects peoples' memory and ability to function day‐to‐day. A clinical diagnosis of dementia usually involves brain scans, physical examinations and history taking. As a first step, we often use memory and thinking tests to identify people who need further assessment. Traditionally these tests are performed in‐person, but modifications of the tests allow them to be used over the telephone or via video calls – sometimes called 'remote assessment'. 
The need for remote assessment has become particularly urgent due to COVID‐19. However, there are potential benefits of remote assessment beyond the COVID‐19 pandemic. Physically attending appointments can be difficult for some people and remote assessments offer greater convenience. Remote assessments are also useful in research, as a large number of people can be reached in a fairly short amount of time. 
A test delivered by telephone may not be as good as the in‐person equivalent, and getting these tests right is important. One the one hand, If a test suggests someone has dementia when they do not (called a false positive), this can have an emotional impact on the person and their family. On the other hand, not identifying memory and thinking problems when they are present (called a false negative), mean that the person does not get the treatment and support that they need. 
What was the aim of this review? 
We aimed to assess whether memory and thinking tests carried out by telephone or video call can detect dementia. 
What was studied in this review? 
We looked at various memory and thinking tests. Many tests have been developed over time and they differ in their content and application, but most are based on a modification of a traditional in‐person test. 
What were the main results of this review? 
The review included 31 studies, using 19 different memory tests, with a total of 3075 participants. 
Only seven tests were relevant to our question regarding accuracy of remote testing. With the limited number of studies, estimates on the accuracy of these tests are imprecise. Our review suggests that remote tests could correctly identify people with dementia between 26% and 100% of the time, and could correctly rule out dementia 65% to 100% of the time. 
The remaining 24 studies compared a remote test with the face‐to‐face equivalent. These studies suggested that remote test scores usually agreed with in‐person testing, but this was not perfect. 
How reliable are the results of the studies in this review? 
In these studies, a clinical diagnosis of dementia was used as the reference (gold) standard. We identified a number of issues in the design, conduct and reporting of the studies. A particular issue was around the selection of participants for the studies. Studies often did not include people with hearing or language impairments that may have complicated remote testing. 
Who do the results of this study apply to? 
Most studies investigated older adults (over 65 years). The findings may not be representative of all older adults with dementia, as some studies only examined specific groups of people, for example, after stroke. The studies were usually performed in specialist centres by experts. So, we do not know how well these tests identify dementia in routine community practice. 
What are the implications of this review? 
The review highlights the lack of high‐quality research describing accuracy of telephone‐ and video call‐based memory and thinking tests. There were many differences between the studies included in this review such as the type of test used, participants included, the setting in which the study is carried out and language studied. This made comparisons between studies difficult. Our review suggests that remote assessments and in‐person assessments are not always equivalent. In situations where access to in‐person assessment is difficult, remote testing could be used as a useful first step. Ideally, this should be followed up with an in‐person assessment before a diagnosis is made. Due to limited studies, and differences in the way studies were carried out, we cannot recommend one particular remote test for the assessment of dementia. 
How up to date is this review? 
This search was performed in June 2021.
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing for Dementia Over the Phone or Video Call

## Plain Title
Can doctors diagnose dementia using phone calls or video calls instead of in-person visits?

## Rationale

**What is dementia?**
Dementia is a long-term brain condition. It gets worse over time. People with dementia have trouble remembering things. They may struggle with daily tasks like cooking or getting dressed.

**How do doctors usually check for dementia?**
Doctors normally see patients in person. They do brain scans and physical exams. They ask about the patient's health history. Doctors also give memory tests. These tests check how well a person thinks and remembers.

**Why use phone or video calls?**
The COVID-19 pandemic made in-person visits hard. Many people could not go to the doctor's office safely. But remote testing helps in other ways too. Some people live far from doctors. Others have trouble traveling. Phone and video calls are easier for them. Researchers can also reach more people faster using remote tests.

**Why did we do this study?**
We need to know if remote tests work as well as in-person tests. Getting the diagnosis right matters a lot. If a test says someone has dementia when they don't, it causes worry and stress. If a test misses dementia when it's there, the person doesn't get needed help and treatment.

**What did we want to find out?**
We wanted to see how well phone and video tests can find dementia. We looked at whether these remote tests are as good as in-person tests.

## Trial Design

**How did we do this review?**
We looked at 31 different studies. These studies included 3,075 people total. The studies tested 19 different types of memory tests. All tests were done by phone or video call.

**Who was in these studies?**
Most people in the studies were over 65 years old. Some studies looked at specific groups. For example, some only included people who had a stroke. Most studies were done in special medical centers. Experts ran the tests.

**How long did the studies last?**
The studies we reviewed were done up to June 2021. Each study had different lengths. The review does not say how long each person spent in their study.

**What did we compare?**
We looked at two things. First, we checked if remote tests could correctly find dementia. Second, we compared remote tests to in-person tests. We wanted to see if they gave the same results.

## Results

**What did we find?**
Only 7 of the 19 tests gave us clear accuracy information. The results varied a lot. Remote tests found dementia correctly between 26% and 100% of the time. That means 26 to 100 out of 100 people with dementia were identified. Remote tests correctly ruled out dementia 65% to 100% of the time. That means 65 to 100 out of 100 people without dementia were correctly identified.

The other 24 studies compared remote tests to in-person tests. Remote test scores usually matched in-person test scores. But the match was not perfect.

**What problems did we find?**
The studies had some issues. Many studies left out certain people. They did not include people with hearing problems. They did not include people with language difficulties. These are people who might struggle with phone or video tests. Most studies were done by experts in special centers. We don't know if regular doctors would get the same results.

**What does this mean for patients?**
Remote tests and in-person tests don't always give the same answer. Remote tests can be a good first step. They work well when in-person visits are hard. But patients should get an in-person visit before getting a final diagnosis.

We cannot say which remote test is best. The studies were too different from each other. They used different tests and different types of patients. More research is needed.

**Why is this important?**
Remote testing can help many people. It makes care easier to access. But doctors and patients need to know the limits. Remote tests are useful for screening. They help decide who needs more testing. But they should not replace in-person visits for final diagnosis."
10.1002-14651858.CD013732.pub2-pls.txt,"Opioids for newborns receiving mechanical ventilation
Review question 
Do drugs such as morphine and fentanyl (opioids) save lives, reduce pain, or improve the long‐term development of newborns needing breathing machines (mechanical ventilators)?Background 
Breathing machines are widely used for newborn full‐term (≥ 37 weeks' gestational age) and preterm (< 37 weeks' gestational age) babies with breathing problems. Breathing machines may cause babies pain. Moreover, their use requires the presence and suctioning of a tube placed in the baby's trachea (which connects the larynx to the bronchi of the lungs), thus causing additional pain and distress. Since newborn babies are very sensitive to pain, which may have a bad effect on future development, pain reduction with drugs (including opioids such as morphine and fentanyl) might be very important. Pain in babies is assessed by adults by using different scales, which focus on the baby's appearance and behaviour, and on other parameters. Study characteristicsWe collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer the review question and found 23 studies enrolling 2023 babies. In most studies, babies were born before the due date (before 37 weeks' gestational age). Eight studies compared the use of morphine versus placebo (a substance with no therapeutic value) or no intervention, and seven versus fentanyl. We analysed the other studies separately because researchers compared the use of these two drugs with other opioids or other analgesics. 
Key results 
We are uncertain whether opioids have an effect on pain and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 24 months; use of morphine or fentanyl probably has little or no effect in reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation and neonatal mortality. Further research is needed. 
Certainty of evidence 
The certainty of evidence is very low to moderate because overall only a small number of studies have looked at this intervention, few babies were included in these studies, and some studies could have been better designed. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We searched for studies that had been published up to 29 September 2020.
","# Plain Language Summary: Opioids for Newborns Receiving Mechanical Ventilation

## Plain Title
Do Pain Medicines Help Newborn Babies Who Need Breathing Machines?

## Rationale

### What is the condition?
Some newborn babies have trouble breathing on their own. These babies need help from breathing machines. The machines are also called ventilators.

### Why is this a problem?
Breathing machines can cause pain to babies. Doctors must put a tube down the baby's throat. The tube goes into the windpipe. This tube helps the baby breathe. But it can hurt. Doctors also need to clean out the tube often. This cleaning causes more pain.

Newborn babies feel pain just like older children and adults. Pain may harm how a baby grows and learns later in life. This makes pain control very important for newborn babies.

### What are opioids?
Opioids are strong pain medicines. Morphine and fentanyl are two types of opioids. Doctors use these medicines to reduce pain in babies.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors need to know if opioids help newborn babies on breathing machines. Do these medicines save lives? Do they reduce pain? Do they help babies grow and develop better? These are important questions that need answers.

## Trial Design

### How is this study designed?
Researchers looked at 23 different studies. These studies included 2,023 babies in total. The researchers collected all the studies they could find. Then they looked at the results together.

### Who was in the studies?
Most babies in the studies were born too early. They were born before 37 weeks. Full-term babies are born at 37 weeks or later.

All the babies needed breathing machines to help them breathe.

### What did the studies compare?
Eight studies compared morphine to a fake medicine or no medicine. Seven studies compared morphine to fentanyl. Other studies looked at different pain medicines.

### When was this review done?
Researchers looked for studies published up to September 29, 2020.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

**About pain:** The researchers are not sure if opioids reduce pain in babies. The studies did not give clear answers about this.

**About long-term development:** The researchers are not sure if opioids help babies develop better. They looked at how babies were doing at 18 to 24 months old. The results were unclear.

**About time on breathing machines:** Morphine and fentanyl probably do not reduce how long babies need breathing machines. The medicines likely make little or no difference.

**About survival:** Morphine and fentanyl probably do not help more babies survive. The death rates were similar with or without these medicines.

### Why are the results uncertain?
The certainty of the evidence is very low to moderate. This means we cannot be very confident in the results. Here is why:

- Only a small number of studies looked at this question
- The studies included only a small number of babies
- Some studies were not designed very well

### What does this mean?
More research is needed. Doctors need better studies to know if opioids truly help newborn babies on breathing machines.

### What is important for patients and families?
Right now, we do not have clear proof that opioids help newborn babies on breathing machines. We also do not have clear proof that they cause harm. Doctors must decide case by case whether to use these medicines. They consider each baby's specific needs.

Families should talk with their baby's doctors. They can ask questions about pain control. They can learn about the benefits and risks of different choices.

More studies will help doctors make better decisions in the future. This will help more babies get the best care possible."
10.1002-14651858.CD013736.pub2-pls.txt,"Cuffed versus uncuffed endotracheal tubes for neonates
Background: newborn babies rarely need a tube placed in the windpipe; however, this may occur before a procedure or to help with breathing. The tube may or may not have a cuff. The standard of care in newborn babies is a tube without a cuff. Cuffed tubes are used more frequently in older babies and children to reduce leaks of gas around the tube, the risk of aspiration (breathing food, saliva, or stomach contents into the airways or lungs), the need to change the tube, or the tube coming out. 
Review question: in this review, we evaluated the evidence for or against using a cuffed tube in newborn babies. 
Study characteristics: we collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer the review question and found one study enrolling 76 babies, of whom 69 met eligibility for this review. This review is up‐to‐date as of 20 August 2021. 
Key results: there is not enough evidence for or against tubes with a cuff to prevent airway problems. Newborn babies who have a tube with a cuff may require less frequent replacement of the tube for any reason and less frequent replacement of the tube to find the correct size than babies who had a tube without a cuff. 
Reliability of the evidence: we judged the reliability of the evidence to be very low. This is because only a few babies were in a single trial and there was possible bias. There is one ongoing trial. We classified two studies as awaiting classification because outcome data were not reported separately for newborns and older infants. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Breathing Tubes With or Without Cuffs for Newborn Babies

## Plain Title
Comparing Two Types of Breathing Tubes for Newborn Babies

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**
Some newborn babies need help breathing. This can happen before a medical procedure or when a baby has trouble breathing on their own.

**What is done to help?**
Doctors place a tube into the baby's windpipe (the airway that goes to the lungs). This tube helps the baby breathe. There are two types of tubes: tubes with a cuff and tubes without a cuff. A cuff is like a small balloon around the tube. Doctors can inflate this balloon to help the tube fit better.

**What is the current practice?**
Most newborn babies get tubes without cuffs. This is the standard care. Older babies and children often get tubes with cuffs. The cuff helps stop air from leaking around the tube. It may also stop food or saliva from getting into the lungs. It may mean the tube does not need to be changed as often.

**Why was this study needed?**
Researchers wanted to know if tubes with cuffs work better for newborn babies. They wanted to see if cuffed tubes are safer and more helpful than tubes without cuffs.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was a review study. Researchers looked at all available studies on this topic. They wanted to find all the evidence about cuffed and uncuffed tubes in newborns.

**Who was in the studies?**
The researchers found one study that could answer their question. This study included 76 newborn babies. Of these babies, 69 met the rules for being in the review. Some babies got tubes with cuffs. Other babies got tubes without cuffs.

**How long did the study last?**
The review looked at studies published up to August 20, 2021. The review does not say how long each baby was in the original study.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**
The researchers did not find enough evidence to say if one type of tube is better. They could not tell if cuffed tubes prevent breathing problems better than uncuffed tubes.

However, they found some possible benefits of cuffed tubes:
- Babies with cuffed tubes may need fewer tube changes overall
- Babies with cuffed tubes may need fewer tube changes to find the right size

**What does this mean?**
The evidence is very limited. Only one small study with 69 babies was available. This is not enough to make strong conclusions.

**How reliable is the evidence?**
The researchers rated the evidence as very low quality. This means we cannot be very sure about the findings. There are several reasons for this:
- Only one study was found
- The study had only a small number of babies
- The study may have had some problems in how it was done

**What happens next?**
One more study is currently happening. Two other studies exist but could not be used. These studies did not report results for newborns separately from older babies.

**What are the conclusions?**
More research is needed. Doctors cannot yet say if cuffed tubes are better or worse than uncuffed tubes for newborn babies. The current evidence is too weak to change how doctors care for newborns. For now, tubes without cuffs remain the standard care for newborn babies who need breathing tubes."

Why is this review important? 
Road traffic suicides are difficult to distinguish from motor vehicle crash fatalities and, therefore, no official figures exist for this method of suicide. Limiting access to lethal methods used for suicide (called means restriction) is an important universal or population strategy for preventing suicide. While there is evidence that means restriction is an effective approach for preventing suicides, the evidence for preventing suicide on roads is not well established. Therefore, this review aimed to explore the impact restriction of access would have on suicide on roads. 
Searching for evidence 
We searched several medical databases to find studies that assessed the impact of restricting access to means of suicide on roads. We searched the databases up to March 2020. We also searched international trial registries for unpublished and ongoing studies. Our main outcomes of interest were suicide and attempted suicide or self‐harm. 
Key results 
We found no studies eligible for inclusion in the review. As a result, we cannot draw any conclusions as to the effectiveness of means restriction interventions for the prevention of suicide on roads. Determining suicidal intent is a major problem in road crash fatalities, therefore clear objective criteria are necessary in order to scale up, study and understand this method of suicide more accurately. Improved awareness of suicide on roads in suicide prevention activities is needed, as well as, its inclusion in future government suicide prevention policies. Robust studies investigating the effectiveness of interventions to prevent suicide on roads are urgently required 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Can Limiting Access to Roads Help Prevent Suicide? A Review of the Evidence

## Rationale

**What is the problem?**

Some people use roads to end their lives. This can happen when someone drives into traffic or causes a crash on purpose. However, it is very hard to tell if a road crash was an accident or if someone meant to harm themselves. Because of this, we do not know how often this happens.

**What is means restriction?**

Means restriction means making it harder for people to access things they could use to harm themselves. This approach has helped prevent suicide in other ways. For example, putting barriers on bridges has saved lives.

**Why was this study needed?**

We do not know if means restriction works to prevent suicide on roads. The researchers wanted to find out if limiting access to roads could save lives. They looked for studies that tested ways to prevent suicide on roads.

**What did the researchers want to learn?**

The researchers wanted to see if any methods had been tested to prevent suicide on roads. They wanted to know if these methods worked.

## Trial Design

**How did the researchers look for answers?**

This was not a study with patients. Instead, the researchers did a review. They searched medical databases for studies done by other researchers. They looked for any study that tested ways to prevent suicide on roads.

**What did they search for?**

They searched up to March 2020. They looked in many medical databases. They also looked for studies that were not yet published. They wanted to find studies that measured suicide and suicide attempts on roads.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found no studies that met their needs. Not a single study had tested ways to prevent suicide on roads. Because of this, they could not answer their question.

**What does this mean?**

We still do not know if limiting access to roads can prevent suicide. We need more research in this area.

**What are the main problems?**

The biggest problem is that road crashes look the same whether they are accidents or not. It is very hard to tell if someone meant to harm themselves. We need clear ways to identify when a crash was a suicide attempt.

**What needs to happen next?**

Several things need to happen:
- We need better ways to identify suicide on roads
- People working to prevent suicide need to pay more attention to this problem
- Governments should include road suicide in their prevention plans
- Researchers need to study ways to prevent suicide on roads

**Why is this important?**

Without good studies, we cannot help people who might use roads to harm themselves. We need to understand this problem better. We need to test ways to prevent it. Only then can we save lives.

**Main conclusions:**

Right now, we have no proof that any method works to prevent suicide on roads. This is because no one has studied it properly. More research is urgently needed. Better ways to identify road suicides are also needed. This problem should be included in suicide prevention work.

10.1002-14651858.CD013739.pub2-pls.txt,"Do blood thinners prevent people who are hospitalised with COVID‐19 from developing blood clots? 
Key messages 
‐ High‐dose blood thinners result in little or no difference in death rate and increase minor bleeding compared to low‐dose blood thinners for people hospitalised with COVID‐19. Giving blood thinners compared to not giving blood thinners might reduce the death rate. 
‐ It is very likely that new studies will not change the evidence about the effects of different doses of blood thinners on death rate and minor bleeding. High‐quality studies are still needed to analyse the need for additional respiratory support, giving blood thinners compared to no blood thinners, comparing different blood thinners, and giving blood thinners for extended periods. 
What is COVID‐19? 
COVID‐19 typically affects the lungs and airways; however, in addition to respiratory problems, about 16% of people hospitalised with COVID‐19 experience problems with their blood vessels, leading to blood clots forming in the arteries, veins and lungs. Nearly half of all people with severe COVID‐19 in intensive care units develop clots in their veins or arteries. 
What are blood thinners? 
Blood thinners are medicines that prevent harmful blood clots from forming (deep vein thrombosis). However, they can cause unwanted effects such as bleeding. Some guidelines recommend giving blood thinners when people are first admitted to hospital with COVID‐19 to prevent blood clots from developing, rather than waiting to see whether blood clots develop and then treating them with blood thinners. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether giving blood thinners to people hospitalised with COVID‐19 as a preventive measure reduced the number of deaths compared to people who received no treatment or those who received a placebo treatment (an identical‐seeming treatment but with no active ingredient). We also wanted to determine whether these individuals needed less support with breathing, whether they still developed harmful blood clots, whether they experienced bleeding and whether they experienced any other unwanted events. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed blood thinners given to people hospitalised with COVID‐19 to prevent blood clots. Studies could be of any design as long as they compared a blood thinner with another blood thinner, no treatment or a placebo. Studies could take place anywhere in the world and participants could be any age as long as they were in hospital with confirmed COVID‐19 disease. We pooled the results when appropriate. 
What did we find? 
We included seven studies with 16,185 people hospitalised with COVID‐19 in either intensive care units, hospital wards or emergency departments. Studies were from Brazil (2), Iran (1), Italy (1), and the USA (1), and two involved more than country. People in the studies were aged from 55 to 68 years on average. Studies lasted from 15 to 90 days and provided evidence on deaths, bleeding, blood clotting, length of hospital stay and unwanted effects. There was little or no evidence on need for respiratory support (help with breathing), deaths related to COVID‐19, and quality of life. 
Higher‐dose of blood thinners compared with lower‐dose (4 studies, 4647 people)  In people who received higher compared to lower doses of blood thinners there was little to no difference in death rate. However, people on higher doses were more likely to experience minor bleeding compared to in those on lower doses. People who received higher doses of blood thinners likely had reduced pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung or blood vessel leading to the lung), slightly increased major (more severe) bleeding, and probably had little to no difference in time spent in hospital compared to those who received the lower doses of blood thinners. In people who received higher doses of blood thinners, there was little to no difference in the rate of deep vein thrombosis, and other unwanted events compared to those who received the lower dose of blood thinners. 
Blood thinners compared with no treatment (3 studies, 11,538 people)  People who received blood thinners had a reduced death rate compared to those who did not receive blood thinners, but the evidence is very uncertain. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We are very confident that higher doses of blood thinners do not change the risk of death but do increase the risk of bleeding in people hospitalised with COVID‐19. 
Although our confidence in the evidence is very limited, people who receive blood thinners may have a lower death rate compared to those who did not receive any blood thinners. 
What happens next? 
Our searches found 62 ongoing studies with 35,470 people. We plan to add the results of these studies to our review when they are published. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to 14 April 2021.
","# Plain Language Summary: Blood Thinners for People in Hospital with COVID-19

## Plain Title
Do Blood Thinners Help Prevent Blood Clots in People Hospitalized with COVID-19?

## Rationale

### What is COVID-19 and why does it cause blood clots?
COVID-19 is a disease that mainly affects the lungs. It makes it hard to breathe. But COVID-19 can also cause problems with blood vessels. About 16 out of every 100 people in the hospital with COVID-19 get blood clots. Blood clots are lumps of blood that form inside blood vessels. They can block blood flow. This is dangerous. Nearly half of people with severe COVID-19 in intensive care get these blood clots.

### What are blood thinners?
Blood thinners are medicines. They help stop harmful blood clots from forming. Doctors call these clots ""deep vein thrombosis."" But blood thinners can cause bleeding problems. This is an unwanted side effect.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors wanted to know if giving blood thinners early could help. Some doctors give blood thinners as soon as people enter the hospital. This is to prevent blood clots before they start. Other doctors wait to see if clots form first. Then they treat the clots. Researchers needed to find out which approach works better. They wanted to know if blood thinners could save lives. They also wanted to know if blood thinners were safe.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked at seven different studies. These studies included 16,185 people in total. All these people were in the hospital with COVID-19. Some were in intensive care units. Others were in regular hospital rooms. Some were in emergency departments.

### Who was in the studies?
The studies took place in several countries. Two studies were from Brazil. One was from Iran. One was from Italy. One was from the USA. Two studies included more than one country. People in the studies were between 55 and 68 years old on average. All had confirmed COVID-19 disease.

### How long did the studies last?
The studies lasted between 15 and 90 days. Researchers measured several things. They counted deaths. They looked for bleeding problems. They checked for blood clots. They measured how long people stayed in hospital. They tracked unwanted side effects.

### What did researchers compare?
Some studies compared high doses of blood thinners to low doses. Other studies compared blood thinners to no treatment at all. Some people got a placebo. A placebo looks like real medicine but has no active ingredient.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

**High-dose blood thinners compared to low-dose blood thinners:**

Researchers looked at 4 studies with 4,647 people. They found several important things:

- Death rates were about the same for both groups. High doses did not save more lives.
- Minor bleeding happened more often with high doses. This means small bleeds that are not life-threatening.
- Blood clots in the lungs happened less often with high doses.
- Major bleeding (more serious bleeding) happened slightly more often with high doses.
- Time spent in the hospital was about the same for both groups.
- Other unwanted side effects were about the same for both groups.

**Blood thinners compared to no treatment:**

Researchers looked at 3 studies with 11,538 people. People who got blood thinners had fewer deaths. But the researchers are not very certain about this finding. More studies are needed.

### What does this mean for patients?
The evidence is very strong that high-dose blood thinners do not prevent death. High doses do cause more minor bleeding. For people choosing between high and low doses, low doses appear safer.

The evidence about blood thinners versus no treatment is less clear. Blood thinners might help save lives. But doctors need more information to be sure.

### What happens next?
Researchers found 62 more studies that are still ongoing. These studies include 35,470 people. When these studies finish, researchers will add the new information. This will help doctors make better decisions.

### How current is this information?
This evidence was collected up to April 14, 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013740.pub2-abstract.txt,"Mindfulness for improving mental well‐being in medical students and junior doctors
Why is this review important? 
The medical profession is recognised for its challenging and demanding nature. Medical students and junior doctors have been identified as having increased personal and professional stressors during their years of training. As a result, they face increased strain on their mental well‐being. It is important that this group is supported in their mental well‐being to ensure an overall balance in health, as well as to aid their responsibilities of patient care and patient safety. Furthermore, medical students and junior doctors are often time‐poor. Therefore, it is important to establish whether mindfulness is an effective intervention which justifies its time commitment. There are no previous Cochrane Reviews examining mindfulness in our target population.  
Who will be interested in this review? 
Medical students and junior doctors; other medical professionals at different levels of training and expertise; and institutions such as universities and hospitals involved in the education and training of medical students.  
What question does this review aim to answer? 
What effects do mindfulness‐based psychological interventions have on the mental well‐being of medical students and junior doctors? 
Which studies were included in this review? 
We searched databases to find all studies of mindfulness in medical students and junior doctors published up to October 2021. In order to be included in this review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to groups using a random method). Studies needed to include medical students from any year level or junior doctors in postgraduate years one, two or three. We did not exclude any studies based on participants' age, nationality or pre‐existing health conditions. We included 10 studies with a total of 731 participants in the analysis.  
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
Overall, we did not identify any evidence of an effect of mindfulness‐based interventions on anxiety or depression symptoms. However, mindfulness‐based interventions appeared to have a small positive effect on stress and a borderline positive effect on burnout. We were unable to report if mindfulness‐based interventions had any effect on deliberate self‐harm, suicidal ideation or suicidal behaviour as no studies examined these outcomes. Lastly, as many studies lacked longer‐term follow‐up of participants, it is not possible to comment on the long‐term effects of mindfulness in medical students and junior doctors.  
We rated the overall certainty of evidence as 'low' or 'very low'. 
What should happen next? 
While there were no strong positive findings from the review, some results regarding mindfulness and stress outcomes suggest that there needs to be further research into mindfulness. Any future research should be rigorously designed, and ideally, include assessments of the longer‐term impact of mindfulness.   
","# Plain Language Summary: Mindfulness for Medical Students and Junior Doctors

## Plain Title
Does Mindfulness Help Medical Students and Junior Doctors Feel Better?

## Rationale

**What is the problem?**

Being a medical student or junior doctor is very hard work. These young doctors face many challenges during their training years. They often feel stressed and worried. Their mental health can suffer. This means they may feel sad, anxious, or burned out.

**Why does this matter?**

When medical students and junior doctors feel unwell mentally, it affects their own health. It can also affect how they care for patients. We need to help these young doctors stay healthy and well. This helps them do their job better and keeps patients safe.

**What is mindfulness?**

Mindfulness is a way of training your mind. It teaches you to focus on the present moment. You learn to notice your thoughts and feelings without judging them. Many people use mindfulness to feel calmer and less stressed.

**Why study mindfulness for this group?**

Medical students and junior doctors have very little free time. We need to know if mindfulness really works for them. If it does work, then spending time on it makes sense. No one had studied this question in this exact way before.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this?**

Researchers looked for all studies about mindfulness in medical students and junior doctors. They searched up to October 2021. They only included good quality studies. These were studies where people were put into groups by chance. This is called a randomized controlled trial. It is the best way to test if something works.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included medical students at any year level. They also included junior doctors in their first three years after medical school. The studies did not limit people by age or country. People with existing health problems could join too. In total, 10 studies were included. These studies had 731 people altogether.

**What did people in the studies do?**

Some people did mindfulness training. Other people did not do mindfulness training. Researchers then compared the two groups. They looked at mental health and well-being.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The studies looked at several things. They measured anxiety, depression, stress, and burnout.

**Main findings:**

Mindfulness did not seem to help with anxiety. It also did not help with depression. However, mindfulness did seem to help a little bit with stress. People who did mindfulness felt slightly less stressed. Mindfulness might also help a little with burnout. But this finding was not very strong.

**What was missing?**

No studies looked at self-harm or suicidal thoughts. So we do not know if mindfulness helps with these serious problems. Most studies only followed people for a short time. We do not know if mindfulness keeps working over many months or years.

**How strong is this evidence?**

The researchers rated the evidence as ""low"" or ""very low"" quality. This means we cannot be very sure about the findings. The studies had some problems in how they were done.

**What does this mean?**

The results are not very strong. But the small positive effects on stress suggest mindfulness might be worth studying more. We need better studies in the future. These studies should follow people for longer periods. They should be carefully designed to give clearer answers.

**Why is this important?**

Medical students and junior doctors need support for their mental health. Mindfulness might help with stress. But we need more research to be sure. Future studies will help us know if mindfulness is worth the time commitment for these busy young doctors."

What was the aim of this review? 
This Cochrane Review aimed to determine whether antibiotics are useful and safe for people with ulcerative colitis (UC) in achieving or maintaining remission. 
Key messages 
We found that antibiotics, when added to standard therapies, are similar to placebo in how often they fail to achieve remission or disease improvement for people with UC, measured up to three months from taking them. 
We found that antibiotics when compared to placebo may be useful in achieving remission or some improvement of UC symptoms, measured at 12 months from taking them. 
In terms of safety, the evidence is of low certainty, but antibiotics may be as safe as placebo. 
We have confidence in the findings up to three months, but have less confidence in the evidence at 12 months due to low numbers of study participants. 
What is ulcerative colitis? 
UC is a chronic (long term) inflammatory disease that affects the large bowel. The most common symptoms include bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and a sudden almost uncontrollable urge to pass stool. Some people have other symptoms including sore joints, mouth sores, and inflammation in their eyes. When someone is experiencing symptoms of UC, they are said to have 'active' disease. When symptoms improve with treatment, the disease is said to be responding to therapy. When symptoms stop, the disease is said to be in 'remission'. People with UC in remission are often given therapy with medicines to try and prolong (maintain) their remission or response to therapy. 
What did the review study? 
This review studied the use of antibiotics in the treatment of UC. Eleven studies considered antibiotics as a therapy for achieving remission and one study as therapy for maintaining remission. 
Antibiotics could theoretically be helpful as they might be able to fight harmful bacteria in the gut that are thought to be a partial cause for the presence of UC symptoms. 
Currently, most doctors do not recommend the use of antibiotics unless the patient has an infection. 
What were the main results of the review? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing antibiotics with another treatment or dummy treatment. We found 12 RCTs including 847 participants. The trials looked at people of all ages; using different types and doses of antibiotics; and at antibiotics taken as tablets, injections, or any other way. The main results from our review are as follows. 
1. Antibiotics, when added to standard therapies, are no different from placebo in failing to achieve remission or improve disease symptoms for people with UC when measured up to three months from taking them. 
2. Antibiotics probably fail less than placebo in achieving remission or some improvement of UC symptoms measured at 12 months from taking them. 
3. In terms of safety, antibiotics may be similar to placebo, but the evidence is of low certainty. 
4. We are uncertain about how antibiotics compare to other treatments because there is not enough good evidence to make a judgement. 
Conclusion 
There is no difference between antibiotics and placebo when added to standard therapies to achieve remission or improvement of symptoms in the short term. However, they may help to lessen the number of people who do not achieve remission, and they probably lead to fewer numbers of people who have not achieved improvement of symptoms at 12 months. 
No conclusions can be drawn on other treatments or safety due to lack of evidence, even though there may be a possibility that antibiotics are as safe as placebo. Further research would be needed to clarify the usefulness of antibiotics in the treatment of UC; however, such studies should focus on longer‐term outcomes given the findings of this review. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
This review is up‐to‐date as of December 2021.

## Plain Title
Do Antibiotics Help Treat Ulcerative Colitis?

## Rationale

**What is ulcerative colitis?**

Ulcerative colitis is a long-term disease. It causes swelling in the large bowel. The large bowel is part of the gut where the body removes waste.

**What problems does it cause?**

People with this disease have many hard symptoms. They may have bloody diarrhea. They may feel pain in their belly. They may need to rush to the bathroom suddenly. Some people also get sore joints, mouth sores, or eye problems. These symptoms make daily life very hard.

**What happens with the disease?**

Sometimes symptoms get better. Doctors call this ""remission."" Sometimes symptoms come back. Doctors call this ""active"" disease. Doctors give medicine to help keep symptoms away as long as possible.

**Why study antibiotics?**

Antibiotics are drugs that kill germs. Some doctors think bad germs in the gut may cause ulcerative colitis symptoms. If this is true, antibiotics might help. But right now, most doctors only give antibiotics when a person has an infection. This study wanted to find out if antibiotics really help people with ulcerative colitis.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know two main things. First, are antibiotics safe for people with ulcerative colitis? Second, do antibiotics help stop symptoms or keep symptoms away?

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at 12 other studies. These studies included 847 people total. The people in the studies had ulcerative colitis. They were all different ages.

**How did the studies work?**

Each study split people into groups by chance. Some people got antibiotics. Other people got a dummy pill. A dummy pill is called a placebo. It looks like real medicine but has no drugs in it. No one knew who got real medicine or dummy pills. This makes the test fair.

**What types of antibiotics were tested?**

The studies tested different types of antibiotics. People took different amounts. Some people took pills. Some got shots. Some got antibiotics in other ways.

**How long did the studies last?**

Researchers checked results at different times. They looked at results after three months. They also looked at results after 12 months.

## Results

**What did researchers find after three months?**

Antibiotics did not work better than dummy pills. When added to regular treatment, antibiotics helped about the same number of people as dummy pills. Both groups had similar results for stopping symptoms.

**What did researchers find after 12 months?**

Antibiotics may work better than dummy pills over a longer time. After 12 months, more people who took antibiotics had better symptoms. More people went into remission. But researchers are less sure about this finding. Not enough people were in these longer studies.

**Were antibiotics safe?**

Antibiotics seemed as safe as dummy pills. But researchers cannot be completely sure. The studies did not have enough information about safety.

**What do these results mean?**

In the short term, antibiotics do not help more than dummy pills. But over a longer time, they might help some people. More research is needed to know for sure.

**What do researchers conclude?**

Antibiotics added to regular treatment do not help in the first three months. They may help after 12 months. But doctors need more proof. Future studies should watch people for longer times. This will show if antibiotics really help over time.

**How current is this information?**

Researchers looked at all studies published through December 2021. This review includes the most recent information available at that time.

**What does this mean for patients?**

Right now, there is not strong proof that antibiotics help ulcerative colitis. Patients should talk to their doctor about the best treatment for them. More research will help doctors know when antibiotics might help."
10.1002-14651858.CD013756.pub2-pls.txt,"What are the benefits and risks of electrical spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion stimulation for the treatment of chronic pain in adults? 
Why this question is important 
Persistent (chronic) pain is a common problem that affects people from all walks of life. It can be the result of a wide range of different medical conditions and is sometimes unexplained, but it often causes substantial suffering, distress and disability and can have major impacts on a person's quality of life. 
Implanted spinal neuromodulation (SNMD) interventions involve surgically implanting wires (electrodes) into the space around nerves or the spinal cord that are connected to a ""pulse generator"" device which is usually implanted under the patient's skin. This delivers electrical stimulation to the nerves or spinal cord. It is thought that this stimulation interferes with danger messages being sent to the spinal cord and brain with the goal of reducing the perception of pain. Once implanted with a SNMD device people live with the device implanted, potentially on a permanent basis. We reviewed the evidence to find out whether these interventions were effective at reducing pain, disability and medication use, at improving quality of life and to find out the risk and type of complications they might cause. There are two broad types of SNMD: spinal cord stimulation (SCS), where electrodes are placed near the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRGS) where electrodes are placed near the nerve root, where the nerve branches off from the spinal cord. 
How we identified and assessed the evidence 
First, we searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed the certainty of the evidence. We considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we rated the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. 
What we found 
We found 15 published studies that included 908 people with persistent pain due to a variety of causes including nerve disease, chronic low back pain, chronic neck pain and complex regional pain syndrome. All of these studies evaluated SCS; no studies evaluated DRGS. 
Eight studies (that included 205 people) compared SCS with a sham (placebo) stimulation, where the electrodes were implanted, but no stimulation was delivered. Six studies that included 684 people compared SCS added with either medical management or physical therapy with medical management or physical therapy on its own. We rated the evidence as being of low, or very low certainty. Limitations in how the studies were conducted and reported, the amount of evidence we found and inconsistency between studies in some instances means that our confidence in the results is limited. 
The evidence suggests the following.
Compared to receiving medical management or physical therapy alone, people treated with the addition of SCS may experience less pain and higher quality of life after one month or six months of stimulation. There is limited evidence to draw conclusions in the long term of one year or more. It is unclear whether SCS reduces disability or medication use. 
Compared to a sham (placebo) stimulation, SCS may result in small reductions in pain intensity in the short term that may not be clinically important, but this is currently unclear. There is no evidence at medium or long‐term follow‐up points. 
SCS can result in complications. These include movement or malfunction of the electrode wires, wound infections and the need for further surgical procedures to fix issues with the implanted devices. We also found instances of serious complications that included one death, nerve damage, lasting muscle weakness, lung injury, serious infection, prolonged hospital stay and the extrusion of a stimulation device through the skin. 
Very limited evidence around the costs and economics of SCS suggested that SCS increases the costs of healthcare. It was not clear whether SCS was cost‐effective. 
What this means 
SCS may reduce pain intensity in people with chronic pain. It is currently not clear how much of this effect is due to the SCS itself and how much is due to so‐called ""placebo"" effects, which are the result of the experience of undergoing the procedure and the person's expectations that it will help them. Receiving SCS does present a risk of relatively common complications and less common serious complications. We are currently unsure of the precise degree of this risk. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence in this review is current to September 2021.
","# Plain Language Summary: Electrical Stimulation for Chronic Pain

## Plain Title
Testing Electrical Devices Placed Near the Spine to Treat Long-Lasting Pain in Adults

## Rationale

### What is chronic pain?
Chronic pain is pain that lasts a long time. It affects many people from all backgrounds. This pain can come from many health problems. Sometimes doctors cannot find a clear cause. Chronic pain causes suffering and makes daily life hard. It can stop people from doing things they enjoy. It affects how people feel about their life.

### What is spinal cord stimulation?
Doctors can place small wires near the spine through surgery. These wires connect to a small device placed under the skin. This device sends electrical signals to nerves near the spine. Doctors think these signals block pain messages going to the brain. This may help reduce pain. Once placed, the device stays in the body. It may stay there for life.

### Why was this study needed?
Researchers wanted to know if these devices really work. They wanted to know if the devices reduce pain. They wanted to know if people could do more daily tasks. They wanted to know if people needed less pain medicine. They also wanted to know what problems the devices might cause.

## Trial Design

### How is this study designed?
This was not one study. Researchers looked at 15 different studies. These studies included 908 adults with chronic pain. The pain came from different causes. Some had nerve damage. Some had long-lasting back pain. Some had neck pain. Some had a condition called complex regional pain syndrome.

All studies tested spinal cord stimulation, or SCS. No studies tested a similar device called DRGS.

Eight studies included 205 people. These studies compared real stimulation to fake stimulation. In the fake group, doctors placed the wires but did not turn on the device.

Six studies included 684 people. These studies compared two groups. One group got SCS plus regular medical care. The other group got only regular medical care.

The studies followed people for different lengths of time. Some checked results after one month. Some checked after six months. Some checked after one year or more.

## Results

### What were the main results?
The quality of evidence was low or very low. This means we cannot be very sure about the results. The studies had some problems. There was not much evidence. Some studies showed different results from others.

### Benefits
People who got SCS plus medical care may have less pain than people who got only medical care. This was true after one month and after six months. People with SCS may also feel their quality of life was better. There was not enough evidence to know about results after one year or more.

It is unclear if SCS helps people do more daily tasks. It is unclear if SCS helps people use less pain medicine.

When comparing real SCS to fake SCS, real SCS may reduce pain a small amount. This reduction may be too small to matter to patients. We are not sure. There was no evidence for longer time periods.

### Risks and complications
SCS can cause problems. Common problems include:
- The wires move out of place
- The device stops working correctly
- Infections in the surgical wound
- Need for more surgery to fix the device

Serious problems happened less often. These included:
- One person died
- Nerve damage
- Muscle weakness that did not go away
- Lung injury
- Serious infection
- Long hospital stay
- Device pushing through the skin

### Costs
Very little evidence looked at costs. SCS appears to increase healthcare costs. We do not know if the benefits are worth the costs.

### What do the results mean?
SCS may help reduce pain in people with chronic pain. We do not know how much of this benefit comes from the electrical signals. Some benefit may come from the ""placebo effect."" This means people feel better because they expect the treatment to work. Getting SCS does carry risks. Some complications are fairly common. Serious complications happen less often. We are not sure exactly how often these problems happen.

### How current is this information?
Researchers looked for studies published through September 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013757.pub2-pls.txt,"Palivizumab for respiratory syncytial virus infection prevention in children
Review question 
What are the effects (benefits and harms) of palivizumab for preventing severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children? 
Background 
RSV is the main cause of acute respiratory infections in children, mainly during the first year of life, accounting for 33.1 million infections a year with an estimated 90.6% of these episodes occurring in low‐ and middle‐income countries. These infections may present with a runny nose, fever, cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, or difficulty feeding. They may result in hospitalisation, admission to an intensive care unit, and even death, in particular amongst infants aged less than two months, with an estimated hospitalisation rate of 1970 per 100,000 population and 59,600 deaths annually worldwide in children younger than five years old. They may also lead to long‐term complications such as recurrent wheezing and chronic lung problems.  
Palivizumab, sold under the brand name Synagis, is a drug administered with an intramuscular injection every month up to five doses to prevent serious infections in children at high risk for severe disease. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to 14 October 2021.
Study characteristics 
We included five studies with 3343 participants. All studies included a small number of participants, including children with a high risk of adverse outcomes if infected with RSV due to underlying health issues, such as premature birth or heart or pulmonary problems.    
Study funding sources 
Most studies did not specify their funding sources. One study was funded by Abbott Laboratories and by the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development.  
Key results 
Palivizumab reduces hospitalisation due to RSV infection by 56%; based on 98 cases per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 43 per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in little to no difference in mortality, and little to no difference in adverse events; based on 23 deaths per 1000 participants and 84 adverse events per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 16 deaths per 1000 participants and 81  adverse events per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in a slight reduction in hospitalisation due to respiratory illness by 22% but may result in little to no difference in length of hospital stay. It may reduce RSV infection rate by 67% at two years’ follow‐up. Palivizumab also reduces the number of wheezing days by 61% but may result in little to no difference in days using oxygen, length of stay in the intensive care unit, or mechanical ventilation days.  
Certainty of the evidence 
The overall certainty of the evidence was moderate to high.

A virus called RSV causes lung infections in young children. RSV stands for respiratory syncytial virus. This virus is very common. It causes about 33 million infections each year around the world. Most of these happen in poorer countries.

**What does RSV cause?**

Children with RSV may have a runny nose, fever, or cough. They may have trouble breathing or eating. Some children get very sick. They may need to go to the hospital. Some may need to stay in an intensive care unit. Sadly, about 60,000 children under age five die from RSV each year. Babies under two months old are at highest risk. RSV can also cause long-term breathing problems.

**What is palivizumab?**

Palivizumab is a medicine. The brand name is Synagis. Doctors give it as a shot in the muscle once a month. Children can get up to five shots. This medicine helps prevent serious RSV infections in children at high risk.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if palivizumab really works. They wanted to know if it helps children stay healthy. They also wanted to know if it is safe.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

Researchers looked at five different studies. These studies included 3,343 children in total. All studies were small. They included children at high risk for serious RSV infection.

**Who was in the studies?**

The children had health problems that put them at risk. Some were born too early. Some had heart problems. Others had lung problems. These conditions make RSV more dangerous.

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies followed children for different amounts of time. Some tracked children for up to two years.

**When was this review done?**

Researchers looked at all studies published up to October 14, 2021.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

Palivizumab helps prevent hospital stays from RSV. Without the medicine, 98 out of 1,000 children went to the hospital. With palivizumab, only 43 out of 1,000 children went to the hospital. This means palivizumab reduced hospital stays by more than half.

Palivizumab probably does not change how many children die. Without the medicine, 23 out of 1,000 children died. With palivizumab, 16 out of 1,000 children died.

Palivizumab probably does not cause more side effects. About 84 out of 1,000 children had side effects without the medicine. About 81 out of 1,000 children had side effects with the medicine.

Palivizumab probably reduces hospital stays for any breathing illness. It reduced these stays by about one-quarter.

Palivizumab may reduce RSV infections. At two years, it reduced infections by more than half.

Palivizumab reduces wheezing days. It reduced wheezing by more than half.

**What did palivizumab not change?**

The medicine may not change how long children stay in the hospital. It may not change how many days children need oxygen. It may not change how long children stay in intensive care. It may not change how many days children need breathing machines.

**How good is this evidence?**

The evidence quality was moderate to high. This means researchers are fairly confident in these results.

**What do these results mean?**

Palivizumab helps prevent serious RSV infections in high-risk children. It keeps many children out of the hospital. It appears to be safe. Doctors can use this medicine to protect children who are most at risk."

The overview presents a lot of data from randomised controlled trials and contains an advanced analysis called 'network meta‐analysis'. The analysis allows comparisons of all types of support surfaces for preventing or treating pressure ulcers. This interactive tool may help with navigation of the datahttps://stopthepressure.shinyapps.io/Cochrane_support_surface_reviews/. 
Key messages 
Static air mattresses or overlays, alternating pressure air mattresses or overlays, and gel pads used on operating tables may be better than foam mattresses for preventing pressure ulcers. 
Compared with foam mattresses, alternating pressure air mattresses or overlays probably result in health benefits that outweigh their costs in preventing pressure ulcers. 
Static air mattresses or overlays may be better than foam mattresses for ulcer healing, but may cost more. 
It is unclear what the best treatment is for either preventing or treating pressure ulcers; what the effects of these treatment options are on people’s comfort and quality of life; and whether or not there are any unwanted effects. 
What are pressure ulcers? 
Pressure ulcers (also known as pressure sores or bed sores) are wounds to the skin and underlying tissue caused by prolonged pressure or rubbing. People who have mobility problems or who lie in bed for long periods are at risk of developing pressure ulcers. 
What did we want to find out? 
There are many types of beds, mattresses and overlays specifically designed for people with pressure ulcers. These can be made from a range of materials (such as foam, air cells and gel pads) and are divided into two groups: 
‐ reactive (static) surfaces that apply a constant pressure to the skin; and
‐ active (alternating pressure) surfaces that regularly redistribute the pressure under the body. 
We wanted to find out if different types of reactive and active surfaces:
‐ prevent pressure ulcers;
‐ help ulcers to heal;
‐ are comfortable and improve people’s quality of life;
‐ have health benefits that outweigh their costs; and
‐ have any unwanted effects.
We also wanted to find out what the best treatment options are for either preventing or healing pressure ulcers. 
What did we do? 
We searched for Cochrane Reviews that summarised the results of all available carefully designed studies (controlled trials) evaluating different beds, mattresses and overlays in preventing and treating pressure ulcers. A Cochrane Review provides a high level of evidence on the effectiveness of healthcare interventions. We summarised the results of these reviews in a single document (called an overview of reviews). 
We also collected studies included in these reviews and compared all available treatments at the same time in a single analysis (called network meta‐analysis). We then summarised these results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
Effects in preventing pressure ulcers  
We found four reviews on the use of beds, mattresses and overlays for preventing pressure ulcers. From these, we included 40 studies (12,517 people) in a network meta‐analysis evaluating reduction of pressure ulcer risk. The network meta‐analysis evidence suggests that static (reactive) air overlays, alternating pressure air mattresses, and (reactive) gel pads used on operating tables may reduce pressure ulcer risk compared with foam mattresses. 
We also included 10 studies (7211 people) in a network meta‐analysis evaluating the time taken for new ulcers to develop. The network meta‐analysis evidence suggests that reactive air surfaces may reduce the chances of developing new ulcers compared with foam surfaces. 
Effects in treating pressure ulcers  
We found two reviews on pressure ulcer healing. From these, we included four studies (397 people) in a network meta‐analysis. The network meta‐analysis evidence suggests that more people with ulcers may heal completely using reactive air surfaces than foam surfaces. 
The overview evidence suggests that, if the time needed to completely heal an ulcer is looked at, reactive air surfaces may improve the chances of pressure ulcers healing when compared with foam mattresses. 
However, it is unclear which treatment is best for either preventing or treating pressure ulcers. 
Other effects in preventing and treating pressure ulcers  
The overview evidence suggests that:
‐ compared with foam mattresses, alternating pressure air surfaces probably result in health benefits that outweigh their costs in preventing pressure ulcers; 
‐ reactive air‐filled surfaces may cost more than foam mattresses in healing ulcers; and 
‐ the other benefits and risks of these beds, mattresses and mattress overlays are unclear. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Although the reviews we found used reliable methods, most of the studies in them were small and used methods likely to introduce errors in their results. 
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
The evidence in this overview is current to July 2020.
","# Plain Language Summary: Beds, Mattresses, and Overlays for Pressure Ulcers

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Types of Beds and Mattresses to Prevent and Treat Pressure Sores

## Rationale

### What are pressure ulcers?
Pressure ulcers are also called pressure sores or bed sores. They are wounds on the skin. They happen when pressure pushes on the skin for too long. Rubbing can also cause them.

### Who gets pressure ulcers?
People who cannot move easily are at risk. People who stay in bed for long times can get them. These sores can be very painful. They make life harder for patients. They can take a long time to heal.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors and nurses use special beds and mattresses to help. These surfaces try to reduce pressure on the skin. Some surfaces stay the same all the time. These are called static or reactive surfaces. Other surfaces change pressure regularly. These are called active or alternating pressure surfaces.

Many different types exist. They are made from foam, air cells, or gel pads. Doctors need to know which ones work best. This study looked at all the research done so far. It tried to find out which surfaces prevent sores. It also looked at which ones help sores heal.

### What did researchers want to learn?
Researchers wanted to know if these special surfaces:
- Stop pressure sores from forming
- Help existing sores heal faster
- Make patients more comfortable
- Improve quality of life
- Save money compared to their cost
- Cause any problems or side effects

They also wanted to find the best option for preventing and treating pressure sores.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was not a single study. It was an overview of many studies. Researchers looked at four reviews about preventing pressure sores. They looked at two reviews about treating pressure sores. These reviews included many careful studies. These studies tested different beds, mattresses, and overlays.

### What is a network analysis?
Researchers used a special method called network meta-analysis. This method compares all treatments at once. It can show which treatment might work best. It can compare treatments even if they were never tested against each other directly.

### Who was in the studies?
For preventing pressure sores, 40 studies included 12,517 people. For looking at healing time, 10 studies included 7,211 people. For treating existing sores, 4 studies included 397 people.

The studies included people at risk for pressure sores. This included people who could not move well. It included people staying in bed for long times.

### How long did the studies last?
The overview included studies done up to July 2020. Each individual study lasted different amounts of time. Some tracked when new sores appeared. Others tracked how long sores took to heal.

## Results

### What did the study find about preventing pressure sores?

The study found several surfaces may work better than foam mattresses:
- Air mattresses that stay still (static air)
- Air overlays that stay still
- Air mattresses that change pressure (alternating pressure)
- Air overlays that change pressure
- Gel pads used on operating tables

These surfaces may reduce the chance of getting pressure sores. Air surfaces may also delay when new sores appear.

### What about cost?
Alternating pressure air surfaces probably save money overall. The health benefits are worth more than the extra cost. This is compared to foam mattresses for preventing sores.

### What did the study find about treating existing sores?

Air surfaces that stay still may help more people heal completely. This is compared to foam mattresses. Air surfaces may also speed up healing time.

However, air surfaces may cost more than foam mattresses for treating sores.

### What is still unclear?

Many questions remain unanswered:
- Which surface is the absolute best for preventing sores
- Which surface is the absolute best for treating sores
- How these surfaces affect comfort
- How they affect quality of life
- Whether they cause unwanted side effects

### What are the study limitations?

Most studies were small. Many studies had problems with their methods. These problems could affect the results. More research with better methods is needed.

### What do these results mean?

Special air mattresses and overlays appear helpful. They may prevent pressure sores better than foam. They may help sores heal faster. For prevention, alternating pressure air surfaces seem worth the cost.

Doctors and nurses can use this information. It can help them choose the best surfaces for their patients. However, more research is still needed. Better studies could answer the remaining questions.

10.1002-14651858.CD013776.pub2-pls.txt,"Blue light‐enhanced versus white light resection in the treatment of non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer 
Review question 
How does a resection (surgical removal) of bladder cancer supported with a special visualization method (blue light) compare to a standard resection with white light in people in whom a tumor of the inner bladder wall is suspected? 
Background 
In people suspected of having bladder cancer, suspicious tissue is cut from the inner bladder wall using a special instrument inserted through the urethra into the bladder. However, it is sometimes difficult to tell what is normal bladder versus what is cancer. In order to see the tumor better and remove it completely, a substance, or 'contrast agent,' is put into the bladder through a catheter. During surgery, a special light is used that is meant to make the cancerous area light up blue.  
Study characteristics 
We only included randomized controlled trials (a type of study where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) for inclusion in the review, as this type of clinical study is considered to be of the highest quality producing the most reliable results. We included people who were very likely to have had bladder cancer because if had been seen on an imaging study (like a computed tomography (CT) scan) or when looking into the bladder. We included studies of people with newly suspected tumors and those who had been treated for bladder cancer before and there was concern it had come back.  
Key results 
We included 16 studies addressing our review question. Overall, blue light‐enhanced resection of bladder cancer may reduce the risk of disease recurrence over time compared to white light resection (low‐certainty evidence) and may reduce the risk of disease progression over time (low‐certainty evidence). However, whether this effect is big enough to be meaningful to people with bladder cancer depends on whether they belong to the low, intermediate and high risk group for disease recurrence or progression.   
We also found that blue light may have little or no effect on the occurrence of serious surgical complications (low‐certainty evidence) or the risk of death from bladder cancer over time (low‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain as to whether blue light TURBT reduces the incidence of unwanted side effects, as the certainty of the evidence was assessed as low. We do not know how non‐serious surgical complications are affected as no data were reported for this outcome. 
Quality of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence was low, meaning that future research would likely change our results. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Blue Light Surgery for Bladder Cancer

## Plain Title
Using Blue Light to Help Doctors Remove Bladder Cancer

## Rationale

### What is bladder cancer?
Bladder cancer grows on the inside wall of the bladder. The bladder is the organ that holds urine. Some bladder cancers only affect the inner lining. Doctors call these ""non-muscle invasive"" cancers.

### Why is this a problem?
When doctors remove bladder cancer, they need to see it clearly. Sometimes it is hard to tell what is normal bladder tissue and what is cancer. If doctors cannot see all the cancer, some may be left behind. This can cause the cancer to come back.

### What did researchers want to learn?
Researchers wanted to know if a special blue light could help doctors see cancer better. They compared two methods:
- Standard surgery using white light
- Surgery using blue light after putting a special dye in the bladder

### Why might blue light help?
Before surgery, doctors put a special liquid into the bladder through a thin tube. Cancer cells absorb this liquid. During surgery, when doctors shine a blue light, the cancer cells glow blue. This may help doctors see and remove all the cancer.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked at 16 different studies. These studies used a strong design called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, patients were randomly put into two groups. One group had surgery with white light. The other group had surgery with blue light.

### Who was in these studies?
The studies included people who likely had bladder cancer. Doctors suspected cancer because:
- They saw something on a scan (like a CT scan)
- They looked inside the bladder and saw a tumor

Some people had never had bladder cancer before. Others had been treated for bladder cancer in the past. Doctors were worried their cancer had come back.

### What happened during the studies?
Doctors removed the suspected cancer through the urethra. The urethra is the tube that carries urine out of the body. Doctors used a special tool to cut away the tumor. They did not need to make cuts on the outside of the body.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

**Cancer coming back:**
Blue light surgery may reduce the chance of cancer coming back. However, the benefit depends on each person's risk level. Some people have low risk. Others have medium or high risk. The benefit may be different for each group.

**Cancer getting worse:**
Blue light surgery may reduce the chance of cancer spreading deeper or getting worse. Again, this benefit may vary based on risk level.

**Safety:**
Blue light surgery appears to be safe. It may cause little or no increase in serious problems during or after surgery. The risk of dying from bladder cancer over time may be similar with both methods.

**Side effects:**
Researchers are not sure about side effects. The information was not clear enough to know if blue light causes more or fewer side effects.

**Missing information:**
The studies did not report information about minor surgical problems.

### What does this mean?
Blue light may help doctors remove bladder cancer more completely. This could help prevent cancer from coming back or getting worse. The procedure appears to be safe.

### Important note about the evidence:
The quality of evidence was low. This means future studies might show different results. More research is needed to be more certain about these findings.

### Why is this important?
If blue light helps doctors see cancer better, they can remove it more completely. This could mean fewer repeat surgeries. It could also mean better outcomes for people with bladder cancer."
10.1002-14651858.CD013779-pls.txt,"What is the best way to support resilience and mental well‐being in frontline healthcare professionals during and after a pandemic? 
What is ‘resilience’? 
Working as a 'frontline' health or social care professional during a global disease pandemic, like COVID‐19, can be very stressful. Over time, the negative effects of stress can lead to mental health problems such as depression and anxiety, which, in turn, may affect work, family and other social relationships. ‘Resilience’ is the ability to cope with the negative effects of stress and so avoid mental health problems and their wider effects. 
Healthcare providers can use various strategies (interventions) to support resilience and mental well‐being in their frontline healthcare professionals. These could include work‐based interventions, such as changing routines or improving equipment; or psychological support interventions, such as counselling. 
What did we want to find out? 
First (objective 1), we wanted to know how successfully any interventions improved frontline health professionals’ resilience or mental well‐being. 
Second (objective 2), we wanted to know what made it easier (facilitators) or harder (barriers) to deliver these interventions. 
What did we do? 
We searched medical databases for any kind of study that investigated interventions designed to support resilience and mental well‐being in healthcare professionals working at the front line during infectious disease outbreaks. The disease outbreaks had to be classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as epidemics or pandemics, and take place from 2002 onwards (the year before the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak). 
What did we find? 
We found 16 relevant studies. These studies came from different disease outbreaks ‐ two were from SARS; nine from Ebola; one from Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); and four from COVID‐19. The studies mainly looked at workplace interventions that involved either psychological support (for example, counselling or seeing a psychologist) or work‐based interventions (for example, giving training, or changing routines). 
Objective 1: one study investigated how well an intervention worked. This study was carried out immediately after the Ebola outbreak, and investigated whether staff who were training to give other people (such as patients and their family members) 'psychological first aid' felt less ‘burnt out’. We had some concerns about the results that this study reported and about some of its methods. This means that our certainty of the evidence is very low and we cannot say whether the intervention helped or not. 
Objective 2: all 16 studies provided some evidence about barriers and facilitators to implement interventions. We found 17 main findings from these studies. We do not have high confidence in any of the findings; we had moderate confidence in six findings and low to very low confidence in 11 findings. 
We are moderately confident that the following two factors were barriers to implementation of an intervention: frontline workers, or the organisations in which they worked, not being fully aware of what they needed to support their mental well‐being; and a lack of equipment, staff time or skills needed for an intervention. 
We are moderately confident that the following three factors were facilitators to implementation of an intervention: interventions that could be adapted for a local area; having effective communication, both formally within an organisation and informal or social networks; and having positive, safe and supportive learning environments for frontline healthcare professionals. 
We are moderately confident that the knowledge and beliefs that frontline healthcare professionals have about an intervention can either help or hinder implementation of the intervention. 
Key messages 
We did not find any evidence that tells us about how well different strategies work at supporting the resilience and mental well‐being of frontline workers. We found some limited evidence about things that might help successful delivery of interventions. Properly planned research studies to find out the best ways to support the resilience and mental well‐being of health and social care workers are urgently required. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
This review includes studies published up to 28 May 2020.

## Plain Title

What Helps Healthcare Workers Stay Strong and Healthy During Disease Outbreaks?

## Rationale

Healthcare workers who care for sick people during major disease outbreaks face a lot of stress. These workers are called ""frontline"" workers because they work directly with patients. The stress from this work can build up over time. It can lead to mental health problems like feeling very sad or worried. These problems can affect their work, their families, and their friends.

""Resilience"" means being able to handle stress without getting sick. It helps workers stay mentally healthy even when their job is very hard.

Hospitals and health systems can help their workers in different ways. They might change work schedules or provide better safety equipment. They might also offer counseling or other mental health support.

Researchers wanted to learn which support methods work best. They also wanted to know what makes these support programs easy or hard to use. This information is important because healthcare workers need help to stay healthy during disease outbreaks. When workers are healthy, they can better care for patients.

## Trial Design

This was not a single study. Instead, researchers looked at many different studies done by other scientists. They searched medical databases for any study about helping healthcare workers during disease outbreaks.

The studies had to meet certain rules. The disease outbreak had to be big enough that the World Health Organization called it an epidemic or pandemic. The outbreak had to happen after 2002. That was the year before the SARS outbreak.

The researchers found 16 studies that fit their rules. These studies looked at different disease outbreaks. Two studies were about SARS. Nine were about Ebola. One was about MERS. Four were about COVID-19.

Most studies looked at two types of help. Some offered mental health support like counseling. Others made workplace changes like better training or different work schedules.

The studies included healthcare workers of different types. They worked directly with sick patients during these outbreaks.

## Results

The researchers wanted to answer two main questions.

**Question 1: Do support programs actually help workers?**

Only one study tested whether a program worked. This study happened after the Ebola outbreak. Workers learned how to give ""psychological first aid"" to patients and families. The researchers checked if these workers felt less ""burnt out"" afterward.

The study had some problems with its methods. The researchers could not trust the results completely. They cannot say if the program helped or not.

**Question 2: What makes support programs easier or harder to use?**

All 16 studies gave some information about this question. The researchers found 17 main points. They felt moderately sure about 6 points. They felt less sure about 11 points.

**Things that made programs harder to use:**

Workers and hospitals did not always know what kind of help they needed. There was not enough equipment, time, or trained staff to run the programs.

**Things that made programs easier to use:**

Programs worked better when they could be changed to fit local needs. Good communication helped, both official work messages and informal talking between workers. Workers did better when they had safe, positive places to learn and get support.

**Something that could help or hurt:**

What workers believed about a support program affected whether it worked. If they thought it would help, it was more likely to succeed.

**Main conclusions:**

The researchers did not find good evidence about which support programs work best. They found only limited information about what helps programs succeed. More research is urgently needed. Scientists need to do careful studies to learn the best ways to help healthcare workers stay mentally healthy during disease outbreaks.

10.1002-14651858.CD013786.pub2-pls.txt,"Accuracy of telehealth assessment for diagnosing dementia and mild cognitive impairment
Background 
Dementia is an illness in which memory and other thinking skills deteriorate to the point that someone can no longer manage their daily activities without assistance. If the memory and thinking problems are milder, so that independent living is not affected, the condition is described as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Both conditions usually affect older people. It is considered important that people with dementia or MCI can get an accurate diagnosis at a time and place suitable for them so that they and their families can understand the problem and can access treatment and support. However millions of people with dementia around the world never get a diagnosis. There are many reasons for this, but one may be a lack of accessible diagnostic services, particularly for people in rural areas or those who find it difficult to travel. During the COVID‐19 pandemic, many face‐to‐face services were closed. Telehealth ‐ the use of information and communication technology (ICT) to provide health services at a distance may be a way to increase access to specialist assessment for people with suspected dementia who cannot easily get to clinics. However, it is important to be sure that increased accessibility does not come at the expense of accuracy of diagnosis. 
Review question 
We asked how accurate telehealth diagnoses of dementia and MCI were compared to diagnoses made when patients attend traditional clinics for a face‐to‐face assessment. 
What we did 
We searched databases of medical studies up to 4 November 2020 for studies in which people had two assessments for suspected dementia or MCI: one telehealth assessment and one conventional face‐to‐face assessment. Both assessments were done by specialists and took place within a month of each other. For the telehealth assessment, all contact between the patient and the diagnosing specialist had to have been done remotely, using ICT, but some of the information needed to make the diagnosis could be collected by other members of the healthcare team who saw the patient in person. We then assessed how closely the results of the telehealth assessments agreed with the face‐to‐face assessments. 
What we found 
We included three studies (136 participants) who had suspected dementia. One small study (16 participants) was conducted in veterans' homes in the USA; the other two studies were in community services in Australia. They all used videoconference systems for their telehealth assessments. All three studies aimed to make dementia diagnoses but only one also aimed to diagnose MCI. The quality of the studies was generally good. In two studies, nurses who saw the patients in person played a big role in gathering information used in both assessments, which could bias those studies towards close agreement between the assessments. 
The studies found that telehealth assessment correctly identified 80% to 100% of the people who were diagnosed with dementia at face‐to‐face assessment and also correctly identified 80% to 100% of people who did not have dementia. 
Only one study (100 participants) attempted to diagnose MCI. In this study, 71% of participants who had MCI and 73% of participants who did not have MCI were correctly identified using telehealth assessment. 
Telehealth assessment in this study correctly identified 97% of the participants who had either MCI or dementia, but correctly identified only 22% of those who did not have either, although again this result was very uncertain because of the very small number of people in this category. 
It is important to note that diagnoses of dementia and MCI made by two specialists seeing patients face‐to‐face will not show 100% agreement. Therefore perfect agreement between telehealth and face‐to‐face assessments cannot be expected. 
What we concluded 
From the evidence we found, telehealth assessment for diagnosing dementia seems to have a good level of accuracy when compared to face‐to‐face assessment, although the small number of studies and participants and differences between the included studies means that there is a lot of uncertainty about this result. Telehealth appeared to be a little less accurate for diagnosing MCI than for diagnosing dementia. Agreement between two face‐to‐face assessments is also not perfect and we cannot say that disagreements between telehealth and face‐to‐face diagnoses were any more common.

Can Doctors Diagnose Memory Problems Accurately Using Video Calls?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Dementia is a brain illness that affects older people. It causes memory and thinking problems that get worse over time. People with dementia need help with daily tasks like cooking, bathing, and paying bills.

Some people have milder memory problems called mild cognitive impairment, or MCI. People with MCI can still live on their own. They do not need help with daily tasks.

**Why is this important?**

Getting the right diagnosis helps people understand what is happening. It helps them get treatment and support. But millions of people never get diagnosed. Some people live far from doctors. Some cannot travel easily. During COVID-19, many clinics closed.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Telehealth means using phones or computers to see a doctor from home. Researchers wanted to know if doctors could diagnose dementia and MCI accurately using video calls. They compared video call diagnoses to regular in-person clinic visits.

## Trial Design

**How did this study work?**

Researchers looked for studies where people got two check-ups. One check-up was by video call. One check-up was in person at a clinic. Both check-ups happened within one month. Specialists did both check-ups.

**Who was in the studies?**

The researchers found three studies with 136 older people total. All these people had possible memory problems. One study had 16 people living in veterans' homes in America. Two studies included people living in the community in Australia.

**What methods were used?**

All three studies used video calls for telehealth. All three studies tried to diagnose dementia. Only one study also tried to diagnose MCI. That study had 100 people in it.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

For dementia, video call check-ups worked well. They correctly found 8 to 10 out of every 10 people who had dementia. They also correctly found 8 to 10 out of every 10 people who did not have dementia.

For MCI, video calls were less accurate. In one study, video calls correctly found about 7 out of every 10 people who had MCI. They also correctly found about 7 out of every 10 people who did not have MCI.

When looking for either dementia or MCI together, video calls found almost everyone who had problems. They found 97 out of 100 people correctly. But they only found 22 out of 100 people who had no problems.

**What does this mean?**

Video call check-ups seem to work well for diagnosing dementia. They work less well for diagnosing MCI. But even two doctors seeing someone in person do not always agree. So perfect agreement is not expected.

**What are the limits of these findings?**

Only three small studies were found. This makes the results uncertain. In two studies, nurses who saw patients in person helped gather information. This might have made the two types of check-ups seem more similar than they really were.

**What are the conclusions?**

Video call check-ups appear accurate for diagnosing dementia. They may help people who cannot easily get to clinics. More research with more people is needed to be sure about these results."
10.1002-14651858.CD013787-pls.txt,"How accurate are routine laboratory tests for diagnosis of COVID‐19?
What are routine laboratory tests? 
Routine laboratory tests are blood tests that assess the health status of a patient. Tests include counts of different types of white blood cells (these help the body fight infection), and detection of markers (proteins) that indicate organ damage, and general inflammation. These tests are widely available and in some places they may be the only tests available for diagnosis of COVID‐19. 
What did we want to find out? 
People with suspected COVID‐19 need to know quickly whether they are infected so that they can self‐isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. 
Currently, the standard test for COVID‐19 is usually the RT‐PCR test. In the RT‐PCR, samples from the nose and throat are sent away for testing, usually to a large, central laboratory with specialist equipment. Other tests include imaging tests, like X‐rays, which also require specialist equipment. 
We wanted to know whether routine laboratory tests were sufficiently accurate to diagnose COVID‐19 in people with suspected COVID‐19. We also wanted to know whether they were accurate enough to prioritize patients for different levels of treatment. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed the accuracy of routine laboratory tests to diagnose COVID‐19 compared with RT‐PCR or other tests. Studies could be of any design and be set anywhere in the world. Studies could include participants of any age or sex, with suspected COVID‐19, or use samples from people known to have – or not to have ‐ COVID‐19. 
What we found 
We found 21 studies that looked at 67 different routine laboratory tests for COVID‐19. Most of the studies looked at how accurately these tests diagnosed infection with the virus causing COVID‐19. Four studies included both children and adults, 16 included only adults and one study only children. Seventeen studies were done in China, and one each in Iran, Italy, Taiwan and the USA. All studies took place in hospitals, except one that used samples from a database. Most studies used RT‐PCR to confirm COVID‐19 diagnosis. 
Accuracy of tests is most often reported using ‘sensitivity’ and ‘specificity’. Sensitivity is the proportion of people with COVID‐19 correctly detected by the test; specificity is the proportion of people without COVID‐19 who are correctly identified by the test. The nearer sensitivity and specificity are to 100%, the better the test. A test to prioritize people for treatment would require a high sensitivity of more than 80%. 
Where four or more studies evaluated a particular test, we pooled their results and analyzed them together. Our analyses showed that only three of the tests had both sensitivity and specificity over 50%. Two of these were markers for general inflammation (increases in interleukin‐6 and C‐reactive protein). The third was for lymphocyte count decrease. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell where a low count might indicate infection. 
How reliable are the results? 
Our confidence in the evidence from this review is low because the studies were different from each other, which made them difficult to compare. For example, some included very sick people, while some included people with hardly any COVID‐19 symptoms. Also, the diagnosis of COVID‐19 was confirmed in different ways: RT‐PCR was sometimes used in combination with other tests. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Routine laboratory tests can be issued by most healthcare facilities. However, our results are probably not representative of most clinical situations in which these tests are being used. Most studies included very sick people with high rates of COVID‐19 virus infection of between 27% and 76%. In most primary healthcare facilities, this percentage will be lower. 
What does this mean? 
Routine laboratory tests cannot distinguish between COVID‐19 and other diseases as the cause of infection, inflammation or tissue damage. None of the tests performed well enough to be a standalone diagnostic test for COVID‐19 nor to prioritize patients for treatment. They will mainly be used to provide an overall picture about the health status of the patient. The final COVID‐19 diagnosis has to be made based on other tests. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We searched all COVID‐19 studies up to 4 May 2020.

## Plain Title
Can Standard Blood Tests Diagnose COVID-19?

## Rationale

### What are standard blood tests?
Standard blood tests check how healthy a person is. These tests count white blood cells. White blood cells help fight germs. The tests also look for proteins that show if body parts are damaged. They check for signs of swelling inside the body.

### Why was this study needed?
People who might have COVID-19 need to know fast if they are sick. Then they can stay home. They can get treatment. They can tell people they were near.

The usual COVID-19 test is called RT-PCR. A nurse takes a sample from the nose and throat. The sample goes to a special lab. This takes time. Some places do not have these special labs.

Standard blood tests are easier to do. Most clinics and hospitals can do them. The researchers wanted to know if these simple blood tests could find COVID-19. They wanted to know if the tests were good enough to help doctors decide who needs treatment first.

### What did the researchers think would happen?
The researchers thought standard blood tests might help diagnose COVID-19. They thought these tests might show changes in the blood when someone has COVID-19.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at 21 studies that other scientists had already done. They collected all the information together.

### Who was in the studies?
The studies included people with possible COVID-19. Most studies were done in hospitals. Four studies had both children and adults. Sixteen studies had only adults. One study had only children.

### Where did the studies happen?
Most studies (17 out of 21) happened in China. One study each happened in Iran, Italy, Taiwan, and the USA.

### How long did the studies last?
The researchers looked at all COVID-19 studies done up to May 4, 2020.

### What did the studies measure?
The studies looked at 67 different blood tests. They checked if these tests could find COVID-19. Most studies used the RT-PCR test to confirm if someone really had COVID-19.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
The blood tests did not work well for finding COVID-19. The researchers looked closely at tests that four or more studies checked. Only three tests were right more than half the time.

These three tests were:
- A test for a protein called interleukin-6
- A test for a protein called C-reactive protein
- A count of cells called lymphocytes

These proteins go up when the body has swelling from infection. Lymphocytes are white blood cells. When their number is low, it might mean infection.

But even these three tests were not good enough. A good test needs to be right 8 out of 10 times or more. None of the blood tests reached this level.

### What does this mean for patients?
Standard blood tests cannot tell if someone has COVID-19. They cannot tell COVID-19 apart from other sicknesses. The tests show general health problems. They show if the body is fighting infection. But they do not show what is causing the problem.

Doctors cannot use these tests alone to diagnose COVID-19. Doctors cannot use them to decide who needs treatment first. Doctors need other tests to confirm COVID-19.

### Why might the results be limited?
The studies were very different from each other. Some included very sick people. Some included people with mild symptoms. Some studies had many people with COVID-19 (27 to 76 out of 100 people). Most clinics see fewer people with COVID-19.

### What do the researchers conclude?
Standard blood tests help doctors see the overall health of a patient. But they cannot diagnose COVID-19 by themselves. Doctors must use other tests to confirm COVID-19. The RT-PCR test or other special tests are still needed.

10.1002-14651858.CD013790.pub2-pls.txt,"Do heated tobacco products help people to quit smoking, are they safe for this purpose, and have they led to falls in smoking rates? 
Key messages 
Heated tobacco probably exposes people to fewer toxins than cigarettes, but possibly more than not using any tobacco. Falls in cigarette sales appeared to speed up following the launch of heated tobacco in Japan, but we are uncertain whether this is caused by people switching from cigarettes to heated tobacco. 
We need more independently funded research into whether heated tobacco helps people stop smoking, whether it results in unwanted effects, and the impact of rising heated tobacco use on smoking rates.  
What are heated tobacco products?  
Heated tobacco products are designed to heat tobacco to a high enough temperature to release vapour, without burning it or producing smoke. They differ from e‐cigarettes because they heat tobacco leaf/sheet rather than a liquid. Many of the harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke are created by burning tobacco. So heating not burning tobacco could reduce the amount of chemicals a user ingests. Some people report stopping smoking cigarettes entirely by switching to using heated tobacco. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review  
Because cigarette smoking is addictive, many people find it difficult to stop despite the harm it causes. We aimed to find out whether trying to switch to heated tobacco helps people stop smoking cigarettes, and whether it results in unwanted effects. We also wanted to find out whether rising heated tobacco use has affected smoking rates or cigarette sales. 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies that reported on the use of heated tobacco for stopping smoking, and on unwanted effects and toxin exposure in people asked to use heated tobacco. Here we only included randomised controlled trials, where treatments were given to people at random. This type of study is considered the most reliable way of determining if a treatment works. Finally, we searched for studies looking at changes in smoking rates and cigarette sales following the launch of heated tobacco to market. We included studies published up to January 2021. 
What we found 
Our search found 13 relevant studies. No studies reported whether heated tobacco helps people stop smoking cigarettes. Eleven trials, all funded by tobacco companies and with 2666 adult smokers, compared unwanted effects and toxin levels in people randomly assigned to use heated tobacco or to continue smoking cigarettes or abstain from tobacco use. 
Two studies looked at how trends in cigarette sales changed following the launch of heated tobacco in Japan. 
What are the results of our review?  
We do not know whether using heated tobacco helps people to stop smoking cigarettes (no studies measured this). 
We are uncertain whether the chances of getting unwanted symptoms from being asked to use heated tobacco are different compared with cigarettes (6 studies, 1713 participants) or no tobacco (2 studies, 237 participants). Serious unwanted symptoms in the short time period studied (average 13 weeks) were rare in all groups, which means we are uncertain about any differences. Toxin levels were probably lower in people using heated tobacco than those smoking cigarettes (10 studies, 1959 participants), but may be higher than in people not using any tobacco products (5 studies, 382 participants). 
The launch of heated tobacco products in Japan may have caused the decline in cigarette sales to speed up over time (two studies), but it is unclear whether the fall in the percentage of people who smoke also sped up because no studies looked at this.  
How reliable are these results? 
Results are based on data from a small number of studies, most of which were funded by tobacco companies.  
Results on unwanted effects are likely to change as more evidence becomes available. However, we are moderately confident that levels of measured toxins are lower in people using heated tobacco than smoking cigarettes, but less confident that levels were higher than in people not using any tobacco. We are also less confident that the launch of heated tobacco caused the fall in cigarette sales to speed up, as results came from a single country. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Do Heated Tobacco Products Help People Stop Smoking?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Smoking cigarettes is very harmful to health. Many people want to quit smoking but find it very hard because tobacco is addictive. When people smoke, they breathe in many harmful chemicals. Most of these harmful chemicals come from burning tobacco.

**What are heated tobacco products?**

Heated tobacco products are devices that heat real tobacco. They heat it enough to make vapor but not enough to burn it. This is different from regular cigarettes, which burn tobacco. It is also different from e-cigarettes, which heat liquid instead of tobacco leaves.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Because heated tobacco does not burn, it might release fewer harmful chemicals than regular cigarettes. Some people say they stopped smoking cigarettes by switching to heated tobacco instead. Researchers wanted to find out three things:
- Do heated tobacco products help people quit smoking?
- Are they safe to use?
- Have they caused fewer people to smoke in places where they are sold?

This study is important because millions of people smoke. If heated tobacco products help people quit smoking safely, they could improve public health.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this?**

Researchers looked for studies published up to January 2021. They found 13 studies that could help answer their questions.

**What types of studies did they find?**

Eleven studies included 2,666 adult smokers. In these studies, people were randomly put into groups. Some groups used heated tobacco products. Other groups kept smoking regular cigarettes. Some groups stopped using all tobacco. Researchers then compared the groups. These studies lasted an average of 13 weeks.

Two other studies looked at cigarette sales in Japan. They checked if sales went down after heated tobacco products became available.

**Important note about funding:**

Tobacco companies paid for all 11 studies about safety and harmful chemicals. This is important to know when looking at the results.

## Results

**Main findings:**

The researchers found no studies that answered whether heated tobacco helps people quit smoking. This is the most important question, but no one has studied it yet.

**What about safety?**

The studies did not show clear differences in unwanted symptoms. People using heated tobacco had about the same number of problems as people smoking cigarettes or using no tobacco. Serious problems were rare in all groups during the short study time. Because of this, researchers cannot say for certain if heated tobacco is safer or less safe.

**What about harmful chemicals?**

People using heated tobacco probably had lower levels of harmful chemicals in their bodies than people smoking cigarettes. However, they may have had higher levels than people not using any tobacco at all.

**What about smoking rates?**

In Japan, cigarette sales went down faster after heated tobacco products were introduced. However, researchers are not sure if heated tobacco caused this change. Other factors might explain it. Also, no studies checked if the actual number of smokers went down.

**What do these results mean?**

We still do not know if heated tobacco products help people quit smoking. We need more research to answer this key question. The research we have suggests heated tobacco may expose users to fewer toxins than cigarettes but more than using no tobacco. We cannot be sure about safety because studies were short and funded by tobacco companies.

**What research is still needed?**

We need studies that are not paid for by tobacco companies. These studies should find out if heated tobacco truly helps people stop smoking. They should also look at long-term safety and how heated tobacco affects smoking rates in different countries."
10.1002-14651858.CD013792.pub2-pls.txt,"Are progestogen treatments effective in preventing miscarriage?
We set out to find out which progestogen treatment is most effective, safe, and has fewer side‐effects for preventing miscarriage in women with threatened and with recurrent miscarriage, using evidence from randomised controlled trials. We looked at the number of women who went on to have a live birth, or miscarriage. 
What is the issue? 
Miscarriage is the most common cause of early pregnancy loss in the first 24 weeks and one of the most common complications in early pregnancy. An estimated 15% to 20% of pregnancies will end in a miscarriage, with 25% of women experiencing a miscarriage in their lifetime. Women can be at risk of a miscarriage if they experience early pregnancy bleeding, or if they have a history of previous miscarriages. 
Why is this important? 
Progesterone is an important pregnancy hormone that helps to maintain a pregnancy. A variety of different progesterone‐like treatments (known as progestogens) have been used to treat women with early pregnancy bleeding. They are also used to prevent miscarriage in women with a history of previous miscarriages. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness, safety, and side‐effects of the available progestogens for preventing miscarriage in these different groups of women. We wanted to find out which, if any, of the treatments is the most effective and safest. We collected and analysed all the relevant studies to answer this question. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence in December 2020 and identified seven studies involving 5,682 women. All women were managed in hospitals. Women were diagnosed with early pregnancy bleeding (known as threatened miscarriage), or had a history of three or more previous miscarriages (known as recurrent miscarriage). Four different progestogen treatments were used: vaginal micronized progesterone, oral dydrogesterone, oral micronized progesterone and 17‐α‐hydroxyprogesterone injected into muscle. In six of the studies the treatments were compared to inactive placebo. 
Three studies involved 4496 women with threatened miscarriage, some of whom had previously experienced a miscarriage. Overall, vaginal micronized progesterone (high‐quality evidence) and oral dydrogesterone (moderate‐quality evidence) made little difference to the number of women who went on to have a live birth when compared with placebo. We further studied the women who had experienced a previous miscarriage, were now presenting with a threatened miscarriage, and were given vaginal micronized progesterone or placebo. For women with one or more previous miscarriages, vaginal micronized progesterone increased the live birth rate compared to placebo (high‐quality evidence). Those women who had no previous miscarriages, but were now presenting with early pregnancy bleeding showed no improvement in live birth rate (high‐certainty evidence). 
For women with recurrent miscarriage, we based our findings on one study involving 826 women. Overall, vaginal micronized progesterone made little difference to the live birth rate when compared with placebo. The evidence for dydrogesterone compared with placebo for women with recurrent miscarriage is of very low‐certainty evidence, therefore the effects remain unclear. No data are available to assess the effectiveness of 17‐α‐hydroxyprogesterone or oral micronized progesterone for the outcome of live birth in women with recurrent miscarriage. 
From the available data, there are likely no differences in adverse events associated with vaginal micronized progesterone. There was no difference in birth defects and side effects with vaginal micronized progesterone when compared with placebo. There was not enough information about safety and birth defects for us to analyse for all the other treatments. 
What does this mean? 
The overall available evidence suggests that progestogens probably make little or no difference to live birth rate for women with threatened or recurrent miscarriage. Vaginal micronized progesterone may increase the live birth rate for women who are experiencing early pregnancy bleeding and have a history of one or more previous miscarriages, with likely no difference in adverse events. There is still uncertainty over the effectiveness and safety of alternative progestogen treatments for threatened and recurrent miscarriage. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Can Hormone-Like Drugs Help Prevent Miscarriage?

## Plain Title
Testing Hormone-Like Drugs to Prevent Miscarriage in Women with Bleeding or Past Pregnancy Loss

## Rationale

**What is miscarriage and why does it matter?**

Miscarriage means losing a baby in the first 24 weeks of being pregnant. It is very common. About 15 to 20 out of every 100 pregnancies end in miscarriage. About 1 out of every 4 women will have a miscarriage at some point in their life. This makes miscarriage one of the most common problems in early pregnancy.

Some women have a higher risk of miscarriage. This includes women who bleed early in pregnancy. It also includes women who have lost babies before.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

A hormone called progesterone helps keep a pregnancy healthy. Doctors use drugs that work like progesterone to try to prevent miscarriage. These drugs are called progestogens. Doctors give these drugs to women who bleed early in pregnancy. They also give them to women who have had miscarriages before.

However, doctors are not sure which of these drugs work best. They also do not know if these drugs are safe. They do not know which drugs cause fewer side effects.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to find out which progestogen drug works best to prevent miscarriage. They wanted to know which drug is safest. They looked at how many women had a live birth. They also looked at how many women had a miscarriage.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers set up this study?**

Researchers looked at seven different studies. These studies included 5,682 women in total. All women got care in hospitals.

The women in these studies had one of two problems:
- They had bleeding early in pregnancy (called threatened miscarriage)
- They had lost three or more babies before (called recurrent miscarriage)

**What drugs did researchers test?**

Researchers tested four different progestogen drugs:
- Vaginal micronized progesterone (put in the vagina)
- Oral dydrogesterone (taken by mouth)
- Oral micronized progesterone (taken by mouth)
- 17-α-hydroxyprogesterone (given as a shot in the muscle)

In six studies, researchers compared these drugs to a placebo. A placebo is a fake treatment with no real medicine.

## Results

**What did researchers find for women with bleeding in early pregnancy?**

Three studies looked at 4,496 women with bleeding in early pregnancy. Some of these women had lost babies before.

For all women with bleeding:
- Vaginal micronized progesterone did not increase live births much
- Oral dydrogesterone did not increase live births much

But researchers found something important when they looked more closely:
- Women who had lost babies before AND now had bleeding did better with vaginal micronized progesterone
- Women who never lost a baby before did not do better with this drug

**What did researchers find for women who lost babies before?**

One study looked at 826 women who had lost three or more babies before. For these women, vaginal micronized progesterone did not increase live births much compared to placebo.

Researchers could not tell if oral dydrogesterone helped these women. The information was not good enough.

Researchers had no information about the other two drugs for women with recurrent miscarriage.

**Were the drugs safe?**

Vaginal micronized progesterone seemed safe. It did not cause more side effects than placebo. It did not cause more birth defects than placebo.

Researchers did not have enough information about the safety of the other drugs.

**What do these results mean?**

Overall, progestogen drugs probably do not help most women avoid miscarriage. But vaginal micronized progesterone may help one group of women. These are women who bleed early in pregnancy AND have lost babies before. This drug seems safe for them.

Doctors still need more information about other progestogen drugs. They need to know if these drugs work and if they are safe."
10.1002-14651858.CD013812-pls.txt,"Which school‐based measures designed to contain the COVID‐19 pandemic have been evaluated to date, and how were they evaluated? 
Why is this question important? 
To combat the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 and the impact of COVID‐19, countries worldwide have taken a variety of public health measures. In many countries, shutting schools was one of the earliest responses. By mid‐April 2020, 192 countries had closed schools, affecting more than 90% of the world’s student population. This severely disrupted school, family and work life, with likely negative impacts including: 
‐ a worsening of children’s and adolescents’ health and well‐being;‐ increases in inequalities between children and adolescents from disadvantaged and more privileged backgrounds;‐ possible decreased parental income and job security;‐ possible loss of parental economic productivity. 
Given the potential negative consequences of school closures, many countries have since reopened schools. To avoid disease transmission among students, between staff and students, and beyond, a range of school‐based measures have been put in place. These include: 
‐ students and staff wearing face masks and regularly washing their hands;‐ adapting school activities (for example, not singing in music classes);‐ improving ventilation systems; and‐ screening suspected cases of infection. 
To date, we know little about which school‐based measures designed to contain COVID‐19 have been evaluated, and how they have been evaluated. It is important to find this out, so that, in time, we can compare the effectiveness of different measures and inform future policy guidelines. 
We set out to identify and map the evidence on school‐based measures to contain COVID‐19. This work is intended to form the basis of a future review about the effectiveness of these measures. This review will inform guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). 
How did we identify and map the evidence? 
First, we searched for studies that evaluated any intervention set in schools designed to prevent the spread of COVID‐19. We considered all types of studies, and a broad range of outcomes, including: 
‐ infectious disease transmission;‐ other harmful or beneficial effects on health;‐ wider implications for society, the economy, and the population. 
We then grouped studies according to how similar or different they were. This allowed us to gauge: 
‐ which types of study have been used to evaluate measures to date;‐ where studies have been conducted;‐ which types of intervention have been evaluated; and‐ which outcomes have been studied. 
What did we find? 
We found 42 studies.
Type of study 
Thirty‐one studies used mathematical modelling designs, to predict the effects of measures on populations. Two studies used experimental designs, in which researchers divide people or settings into groups to compare the effects of different measures. Nine studies used observational designs, in which researchers simply observed the effect of the intervention. 
Study setting 
Studies were conducted in Europe (20 studies), North and South America (13 studies), the West Pacific (6 studies), and the Eastern Mediterranean (1 study). Most studies evaluated measures in more than one school setting (for example, primary education and secondary education). Three studies focused on secondary schools. 
Type of intervention 
Studies evaluated three broad types of measure:
1. Organizational measures to reduce transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 (36 studies): these included: 
‐ measures designed to limit risks of disease transmission between people who come into contact with each other (such as face‐masks and physical distancing policies); and‐ measures to reduce opportunities for contact (for example, staggered arrival, break and departure times). 
2. Structural or environmental measures to reduce transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 (11 studies): for example, dividing up school playgrounds or improving air circulation. 
3. Surveillance and response measures to detect SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (19 studies): these included: 
‐ testing, tracing, and symptom screening; and‐ isolation of confirmed cases or quarantine of suspected cases. 
Outcomes studied 
Studies assessed the effects of measures on:
‐ SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission (29 studies), including the number of new cases or the average number of people to whom one infected person will pass the virus (reproduction number R);‐ healthcare use (8 studies), for example, the number of hospitalizations;‐ other health outcomes (3 studies), for example, the risk of developing hand eczema (a skin condition); and‐ societal, economic, and other population‐level outcomes (5 studies), including cost. 
What are the implications of our findings? 
A wide range of school‐based measures designed to contain COVID‐19 have been evaluated to date. To evaluate these, researchers have used different methods and investigated different outcomes. This review is an important first step in gauging what evidence is available, and will inform future rapid reviews on this topic.

## Plain Title

What School Safety Measures for COVID-19 Have Been Studied and How Were They Studied?

## Rationale

**What is the problem?**

COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. When the pandemic started, many countries closed schools to stop the virus from spreading. By mid-April 2020, schools closed in 192 countries. This affected more than 9 out of 10 students worldwide.

**Why is this a burden?**

Closing schools caused many problems:
- Children's health and well-being got worse
- Poor children fell further behind rich children in learning
- Parents lost income or jobs
- Parents could not work as much

**Why was this study needed?**

Because school closures caused so many problems, countries reopened schools. But they needed ways to keep students and staff safe. Schools tried many different safety measures. These included wearing face masks, washing hands often, changing activities, improving air flow, and checking for sick people.

We do not know much about which safety measures have been studied. We also do not know how researchers studied them. This information is important. It helps us learn which measures work best. It also helps make better rules for schools in the future.

**What was the goal?**

Researchers wanted to find all studies about school safety measures for COVID-19. They wanted to see what has been studied so far. This work will help create future reviews about which measures work best. These reviews will help the World Health Organization make guidelines for schools.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This was not a regular study with patients. Instead, researchers searched for other studies that already existed. They looked for any study that tested school safety measures for COVID-19.

**What did researchers look for?**

They looked for studies that measured:
- How much the virus spread
- Other effects on health (good or bad)
- Effects on society, money, and communities

**What did researchers do with the studies?**

They put similar studies into groups. This helped them see:
- What types of studies were done
- Where studies happened
- Which safety measures were tested
- What results were measured

**Who was included?**

The researchers looked at studies from schools around the world. They included studies with students of all ages.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

Researchers found 42 studies.

**Types of studies found:**
- 31 studies used math models to predict what would happen
- 2 studies compared different groups to see which measure worked better
- 9 studies simply watched what happened when schools used safety measures

**Where studies were done:**
- 20 studies in Europe
- 13 studies in North and South America
- 6 studies in the West Pacific area
- 1 study in the Eastern Mediterranean

Most studies looked at more than one school type. Only 3 studies focused just on high schools.

**What safety measures were tested:**

Three main types of measures were studied:

1. Ways to organize schools differently (36 studies):
   - Face masks and staying apart from others
   - Different start times, break times, and end times

2. Changes to school buildings and spaces (11 studies):
   - Dividing playgrounds into sections
   - Better air flow in classrooms

3. Ways to find sick people (19 studies):
   - Testing for the virus
   - Checking for symptoms like fever
   - Keeping sick people away from others

**What results were measured:**
- Virus spread (29 studies): number of new cases
- Hospital use (8 studies): how many people needed hospital care
- Other health effects (3 studies): like skin problems from hand washing
- Effects on society and cost (5 studies)

**What do these results mean?**

Many different school safety measures have been studied. Researchers used different ways to study them. They also looked at different results. This review is an important first step. It shows what information exists. It will help researchers do future reviews. These future reviews will show which safety measures work best. This will help make better rules for keeping schools safe during disease outbreaks."

Question 
What are the benefits and risks of rho kinase inhibitor eye drops to treat people with either glaucoma or increased eye pressure? 
Key messages 
Antiglaucomatous eye drops such as latanoprost and timolol may reduce the eye pressure more compared with treatment with a rho kinase inhibitor, but the difference with timolol is small. When combining rho kinase inhibitors with different types of medicine, the eye pressure may be reduced more. People treated with a rho kinase inhibitor experience more adverse events (side effects) compared with other treatments. Future research in this area should focus on reporting disease progression (how the glaucoma gets worse over time). 
What is glaucoma? 
Glaucoma is a sight‐threatening eye disease that can lead to blindness if left untreated. There are different types of glaucoma and the most common is called primary open‐angle glaucoma. High eye pressure is a known risk factor for developing glaucoma.  
Medical glaucoma treatment 
There are different types of eye drops that can be used to treat glaucoma. All medical treatments of glaucoma work by reducing eye pressure. Latanoprost and timolol are two glaucoma medications, and one of the new types of glaucoma medicine is called a rho kinase inhibitor.  
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to examine whether the effectiveness and safety of rho kinase inhibitor eye drops were better or worse than other medicines. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared:
‐ rho kinase inhibitor with placebo (a treatment with no therapeutic effect);
‐ rho kinase inhibitor with other types of glaucoma treatments (latanoprost and timolol).
Search date  
We searched medical databases on 11 December 2020.
What did we find? 
We found 17 studies examining 4953 people aged at least 18 years diagnosed with primary open‐angle glaucoma or high eye pressure and treated with a rho kinase inhibitor. The studies varied in treatment duration from 24 hours to 12 months. They were conducted in the USA, Canada and Japan. Of the studies, 16  were funded by pharmaceutical companies and one did not provide information about potential funding sources. The effect of treatment was evaluated by measuring the eye pressure and assessing the adverse events of treatment. 
The studies did not report data disease progression, but they reported data on the lowering of the pressure within the eye and adverse events. Treatment with latanoprost may be better than rho kinase inhibitor. Treatment with timolol may be slightly better than treatment with rho kinase inhibitor. Furthermore, treatment with both rho kinase inhibitor and latanoprost or timolol probably reduces the eye pressure even more. Overall, the studies reported adverse events very differently. More people treated with rho kinase inhibitors may have experienced eye‐related adverse events; however, we are not very certain about these findings. There were no serious adverse events reported for treatment with rho kinase inhibitor. 
Main limitations of the evidence 
The studies did not report all the outcomes that we were interested in. The studies focused on specific outcomes such as eye pressure and adverse events, whereas we wanted to answer other questions as well. The current evidence was based on few studies. Some studies were conducted in a way that may have introduced errors into the results. Studies varied in the way they measured the outcomes and thus may not be comparable to each other.  
","# Plain Language Summary: Rho Kinase Inhibitor Eye Drops for Glaucoma and High Eye Pressure

## Plain Title
How Well Do Rho Kinase Inhibitor Eye Drops Work for People with Glaucoma or High Eye Pressure?

## Rationale

**What is glaucoma?**
Glaucoma is a serious eye disease. It can cause blindness if not treated. The most common type is called primary open-angle glaucoma. High pressure inside the eye can lead to glaucoma. This high pressure damages the eye over time. People with glaucoma may slowly lose their sight.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors use eye drops to treat glaucoma. All glaucoma eye drops work by lowering eye pressure. There are several types of eye drops available. Two common ones are called latanoprost and timolol. A newer type is called rho kinase inhibitor. Researchers wanted to know if this newer medicine works as well as older treatments. They also wanted to know if it is safe. This information helps doctors choose the best treatment for their patients.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Researchers wanted to compare rho kinase inhibitor eye drops to other treatments. They looked at how well each medicine lowers eye pressure. They also looked at side effects from the medicines.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at 17 different studies. These studies included 4,953 people total. All people in the studies were at least 18 years old. They all had either primary open-angle glaucoma or high eye pressure.

The studies compared different treatments:
- Rho kinase inhibitor compared to fake treatment (placebo)
- Rho kinase inhibitor compared to latanoprost
- Rho kinase inhibitor compared to timolol
- Rho kinase inhibitor used together with other medicines

**How long did the studies last?**
Treatment time varied in different studies. Some studies lasted only 24 hours. Other studies lasted up to 12 months.

**Where were the studies done?**
The studies took place in three countries: the United States, Canada, and Japan.

**Who paid for the studies?**
Drug companies paid for 16 of the 17 studies. One study did not say who paid for it.

Researchers searched for studies up to December 11, 2020.

## Results

**What did researchers measure?**
Researchers measured the pressure inside people's eyes. They also tracked side effects from the medicines. The studies did not track whether glaucoma got worse over time.

**What were the main findings?**

*How well the medicines lowered eye pressure:*
- Latanoprost may work better than rho kinase inhibitor at lowering eye pressure
- Timolol may work slightly better than rho kinase inhibitor at lowering eye pressure
- Using rho kinase inhibitor together with latanoprost or timolol probably works even better

*What side effects occurred:*
- More people using rho kinase inhibitors had eye-related side effects
- These side effects were not serious
- No serious harmful events were reported with rho kinase inhibitor treatment

**What are the limitations?**
The studies had some problems:
- They did not measure everything researchers wanted to know
- They focused mainly on eye pressure and side effects
- There were not many studies to review
- Some studies may have had errors in how they were done
- Different studies measured things in different ways

**What do these results mean?**
Older glaucoma medicines like latanoprost and timolol may lower eye pressure more than rho kinase inhibitors. However, the difference with timolol is small. Combining rho kinase inhibitors with other medicines may work better. People using rho kinase inhibitors may have more side effects. These side effects affect the eyes but are not serious.

**What research is still needed?**
Future studies should track whether glaucoma gets worse over time. This would help doctors know which medicine works best long-term."
10.1002-14651858.CD013826.pub2-pls.txt,"Does use of mouth rinse before a dental procedure reduce the risk of infection transmission from patient to health professional? 
Why is this question important? 
Many dental procedures generate droplets that settle on a surface quickly. If high‐speed instruments, such as a drill, are used, aerosols are generated, which consist of tiny particles that remain suspended in the air and that can be inhaled or that settle farther away on surfaces. These aerosols contain a variety of micro‐organisms and may transmit infections either through direct contact or indirectly through the contaminated surfaces. To prevent the spread of infection, it may help to reduce the number of micro‐organisms that are present in these aerosols. The use of mouth rinses before a dental procedure ('preprocedural mouth rinse') has been suggested as a possible way to reduce the amount of contamination of these aerosols. Chlorhexidine, povidone iodine and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) are some of the commonly used mouth rinses. They act by killing or inactivating the micro‐organisms in the mouth and thereby reducing the level of contamination in the aerosol that is generated. We wanted to find out whether rinsing the mouth before a dental procedure reduces the contamination of aerosols produced during dental procedures in practice and helps prevent the transmission of infectious diseases. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? 
We searched for all relevant studies that compared mouth rinses used before dental procedures against placebo (fake treatment), no intervention or another mouth rinse considered to be inactive. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed our confidence in the evidence. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes and consistency of findings across studies. 
What did we find? 
We found 17 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies used chlorhexidine, CPC, essential oil/herbal mouth rinses, povidone iodine and boric acid in comparison to no rinsing, or rinsing with water, saline (salt water) or another mouth rinse. None of the studies measured the how often dental healthcare providers became infected with micro‐organisms. All the included studies measured the level of bacterial contamination in droplets or aerosols in the dental clinic. They did not examine contamination with viruses or fungi.  
Most rinses decreased bacterial contamination in aerosols to some extent, but there was considerable variation in the effects and we do not know what size of reduction is necessary to reduce infection risk.  
The studies did not provide any information on costs, change in micro‐organisms in the patient's mouth or side effects such as temporary discolouration, altered taste, allergic reaction or hypersensitivity. The studies did not assess whether patients were happy to use a mouth rinse or whether it was easy for dentists to implement.  
Overall, the results suggest that using a preprocedural mouth rinse may reduce the level of bacterial contamination in aerosols compared with no rinsing or rinsing with water, but we have only low or very low certainty that the evidence is reliable and we do not know how this reduction in contamination relates to the risk of infection. 
What does this mean? 
We have very little confidence in the evidence, and further studies may change the findings of our review. No studies measured infection risk or investigated viral or fungal contamination.  
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to February 2022.
","# Plain Language Summary: Mouth Rinses Before Dental Work

## Plain Title
Can Using Mouth Rinse Before Dental Work Lower the Risk of Spreading Germs?

## Rationale

**What happens during dental work?**

When dentists use tools like drills, tiny drops form in the air. Some drops fall quickly. Other drops are so small they float in the air. These floating drops are called aerosols. They can land far away or be breathed in.

**Why does this matter?**

These drops and aerosols contain germs from the patient's mouth. The germs can spread to the dentist or dental staff. They can also land on surfaces in the dental office. This could spread infections.

**What might help?**

Using a mouth rinse before dental work might help. The rinse could kill germs in the mouth. This might mean fewer germs in the aerosols. Common mouth rinses include chlorhexidine, povidone iodine, and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC).

**Why study this?**

Researchers wanted to know if mouth rinses really work. Do they lower the number of germs in aerosols? Could they help stop infections from spreading in dental offices?

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not one study. It was a review of many studies. Researchers looked at 17 different studies. They compared what these studies found.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included patients getting dental work done. The studies did not give details about patient ages or gender.

**What did researchers compare?**

They compared different mouth rinses to:
- No rinsing at all
- Rinsing with plain water
- Rinsing with salt water
- Rinsing with other inactive rinses

The mouth rinses tested included:
- Chlorhexidine
- CPC
- Essential oils or herbal rinses
- Povidone iodine
- Boric acid

**What did they measure?**

The studies measured germs in the air during dental work. They counted bacteria in drops and aerosols. They did not look at viruses or fungi.

## Results

**What did the studies find?**

Most mouth rinses lowered bacteria in the air to some degree. However, the results varied a lot between studies. The studies showed different amounts of reduction.

**Important gaps in knowledge:**

The studies did not answer several key questions:
- Did dental workers get sick less often?
- How much reduction in germs is needed to prevent infection?
- Did the rinses cause side effects?
- Did the rinses change taste or cause teeth staining?
- Did anyone have allergic reactions?
- Were patients willing to use the rinses?
- Was it easy for dentists to use this method?
- What about viruses or fungi in aerosols?
- How much does this cost?

**How reliable is this evidence?**

The researchers have low or very low confidence in these findings. This means the evidence is not very reliable. Future studies might show different results.

**Main conclusions:**

Using a mouth rinse before dental work may lower bacteria in the air. But we cannot be sure this actually prevents infections. The link between fewer germs and lower infection risk is not clear.

**What is still unknown:**

No studies measured if dental workers got sick less often. No studies looked at viral or fungal contamination. This is important because many infections are caused by viruses.

**When was this review done?**

The researchers looked at studies published up to February 2022.

**Bottom line:**

Mouth rinses before dental work might reduce bacteria in the air. But we need better studies to know if this truly protects dental workers from getting sick. We also need studies that look at viruses, not just bacteria."
10.1002-14651858.CD013829.pub2-pls.txt,"Impact of computed tomography (CT) on lung cancer screening
Background 
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer‐related death worldwide. Lung cancer survival is significantly dependent on when a person is diagnosed with the disease. It is essential to detect the disease as early as possible by radiography (chest x‐ray) or by computed tomography (CT) scan, which is a more detailed type of radiography where multiple images of the lung are taken. The aim of this review was to gather information on the use of CT scan to detect lung cancer earlier and to find out if early detection of lung cancer reduces death from lung cancer. We also evaluated potential harms that can occur from using CT to screen for lung cancer, such as additional investigations and their related complications. 
Description of included trials 
The evidence is current to 31 July 2021. We included 11 trials, with a total of 94,445 participants. The trials came from the USA and Europe. The earliest trial started in 1991, and the most recent started in 2011. The participants were adults over the age of 40. The frequency of screening with CT ranged from yearly to more than 2.5 years. 
Key findings 
Eight of the trials (91,122 participants) were included in the main outcome analysis of lung cancer‐related mortality. In people over 40 years with significant smoking exposure, CT screening reduced deaths from lung cancer by 21%, with 226 people needing to undergo screening to prevent one death from lung cancer. We also found that deaths from any cause (including lung cancer) were less with CT screening. However, the effect was much lower (only 5% reduction in risk). Lung cancer was detected more frequently in the group of people who had CT screening compared with no screening. However, CT scans can induce false‐positive scans (a test that is positive or indeterminate for lung cancer, when the person does not actually have lung cancer). We found that false‐positive results were more common among people who were screened with CT than chest x‐ray. Because of that, those that underwent CT screening had more tests to investigate both cancer and non‐cancer‐related diseases. Screening also implies a risk of detecting lung cancers that may have never progressed to cause harm to the person (this is referred to as overdiagnosis). The risk of lung cancer overdiagnosis with CT screening was estimated to be 18%. 
The trials were too different or did not provide enough information to look at the impact of screening on stopping smoking or quality of life. There was some evidence to suggest there were no long‐term psychological harms from screening, with some people in the CT screening group feeling less anxious compared to the control groups who were not offered screening. 
Certainty of evidence 
The overall certainty of evidence was moderate when it came to outcomes regarding death, with moderate‐ to low‐certainty evidence for other outcomes. The certainty rating for outcomes reflects the authors' confidence and certainty in the outcome being correct.  
","# Plain Language Summary: Lung Cancer Screening Using CT Scans

## Plain Title
Can CT Scans Help Find Lung Cancer Early and Save Lives?

## Rationale

**What is lung cancer and why is it a problem?**

Lung cancer kills more people than any other type of cancer in the world. When doctors find lung cancer early, people have a better chance of living longer. Finding cancer early is very important.

**How do doctors look for lung cancer?**

Doctors can use two types of scans to look inside the lungs. The first is a chest x-ray. The second is a CT scan. A CT scan takes many pictures of the lungs. It shows more detail than a chest x-ray.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if CT scans could find lung cancer earlier than other methods. They also wanted to know if finding cancer early would help people live longer. The study also looked at problems that CT scans might cause.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 11 studies from the United States and Europe. These studies included 94,445 people in total. The studies started between 1991 and 2011.

**Who was in the studies?**

All people in the studies were over 40 years old. They all had smoked cigarettes for many years. Some people got CT scans. Other people did not get CT scans or got chest x-rays instead.

**How often did people get scanned?**

Some people got CT scans every year. Others got scans less often. Some waited more than 2.5 years between scans.

**How long did the studies last?**

The length of time people stayed in the studies varied. The researchers followed people for several years.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

CT scans helped save lives. Out of every 226 people who got CT scans, one person did not die from lung cancer who would have died without screening. CT scans reduced deaths from lung cancer by about one-fifth.

CT scans also reduced deaths from all causes, not just lung cancer. But this effect was much smaller. The reduction was only about one in twenty.

**Did CT scans find more lung cancer?**

Yes. Doctors found more lung cancer in people who got CT scans. They found it earlier than in people who did not get scans.

**What problems did CT scans cause?**

CT scans sometimes gave false alarms. This means the scan looked like cancer was there, but it was not. False alarms happened more often with CT scans than with chest x-rays.

When scans showed something unusual, people needed more tests. These extra tests looked for both cancer and other diseases. People who got CT scans had more of these extra tests.

Sometimes CT scans found small cancers that would never have caused problems. This is called overdiagnosis. About 18 out of every 100 lung cancers found by CT scans may have been overdiagnosis.

**Did screening affect people's feelings or habits?**

The studies did not have enough information about whether screening helped people quit smoking. They also did not have enough information about quality of life.

Some evidence showed that screening did not cause long-term worry or stress. Some people who got CT scans actually felt less worried than people who did not get scans.

**What do these results mean?**

CT scans can find lung cancer early in people who smoke heavily. Finding cancer early saves lives. But CT scans also cause some problems. These include false alarms, extra tests, and finding cancers that might not need treatment.

**How sure are we about these results?**

The researchers felt moderately confident about the findings on death rates. They felt less confident about some other findings."

Review question 
We reviewed the available evidence on different antibiotic regimens for newborns (from 72 hours of life to one month of life) with late‐onset sepsis. 
Background 
Sepsis in newborns is a severe and potential lethal condition, caused by the body's response to an infection. Neonatal sepsis is the third leading cause of neonatal death globally. Despite this high burden of sepsis in newborns, high‐quality evidence in diagnosis and treatment is scarce. This Cochrane Review was originally published in 2005. To identify the most appropriate antibiotic policies for neonatal sepsis, there is a need to base these policies on an updated well‐conducted review. Therefore, there is a need for such a review assessing the effects of different antibiotic regimens for late‐onset neonatal sepsis. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to March 2021. We included five trials randomising 580 participants. The five trials compared five different antibiotic regimens. 
Key results 
We included five trials: one trial compared cefazolin plus amikacin with vancomycin plus amikacin; one trial compared ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid with flucloxacillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared cloxacillin plus amikacin with cefotaxime plus gentamicin; one trial compared meropenem with standard care (ampicillin plus gentamicin or cefotaxime plus gentamicin); and one trial compared vancomycin plus gentamicin with vancomycin plus aztreonam. 
None of the five antibiotic comparisons showed that the choice of antibiotics influenced the effects on death from all‐causes, serious adverse events (i.e. major complications), circulatory support, nephrotoxicity (toxicity in the kidneys), neurological developmental impairment (disabilities in the functioning of the brain that affect a child's behaviour, memory, or ability to learn), or necrotising enterocolitis (tissues in the gut become inflamed and start to die). Current evidence cannot confirm or reject, one antibiotic regimen being superior to another due to scarce data. 
Quality of the evidence 
Our conclusions are based on very low‐quality evidence. The five trials were at high risk of bias (i.e. the trials were conducted in a way that may have skewed results to the positive side). In addition, the five trials included few participants, making the results of this review imprecise. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Different Antibiotics for Newborns with Late-Onset Sepsis

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Antibiotics to Treat Serious Blood Infections in Newborns

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**
Sepsis is a very serious blood infection in newborns. It happens when the body fights an infection too hard. This can harm the baby's organs. Sepsis is the third most common cause of death in newborns around the world.

**When does late-onset sepsis happen?**
Late-onset sepsis occurs in babies from 3 days old up to 1 month old.

**Why is this a problem?**
Sepsis is very dangerous for newborns. It can cause death. Many babies around the world get sepsis. But doctors do not have enough good information about the best ways to treat it.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors need to know which antibiotics work best for newborn sepsis. Antibiotics are medicines that fight infections. Different antibiotics work in different ways. This review looked at past studies to find the best antibiotic choices. The first version of this review came out in 2005. Doctors needed an updated review with new information.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Researchers wanted to find out if some antibiotics work better than others. They wanted to know which antibiotics save more lives. They also wanted to know which antibiotics cause fewer problems.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was a review of other studies. Researchers looked at studies done up to March 2021. They found 5 studies that tested antibiotics in newborns with late-onset sepsis.

**Who was in these studies?**
All 5 studies included 580 newborn babies total. These babies were between 3 days and 1 month old. All babies had late-onset sepsis.

**What did the studies compare?**
Each study compared two different antibiotic treatments:
- Study 1: cefazolin plus amikacin versus vancomycin plus amikacin
- Study 2: ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid versus flucloxacillin plus gentamicin
- Study 3: cloxacillin plus amikacin versus cefotaxime plus gentamicin
- Study 4: meropenem versus standard care (ampicillin plus gentamicin or cefotaxime plus gentamicin)
- Study 5: vancomycin plus gentamicin versus vancomycin plus aztreonam

**How long were babies in the studies?**
The abstract does not say how long babies stayed in each study.

## Results

**What did researchers find?**
The studies did not show that one antibiotic was better than another. Researchers looked at several important outcomes:
- Death from any cause
- Serious problems or complications
- Need for help with blood flow
- Kidney damage
- Brain development problems
- Gut disease where tissue dies

None of the antibiotic combinations worked better than the others for these outcomes.

**What does this mean?**
The evidence is not strong enough to say which antibiotic is best. The studies had problems that made the results unclear.

**Why are the results unclear?**
There were two main problems:
1. The studies were not done in the best way. This means the results might not be accurate.
2. The studies were small. They did not include enough babies.

**What do researchers conclude?**
Doctors still do not know which antibiotic regimen works best for late-onset sepsis in newborns. More and better studies are needed. These studies should include more babies. They should be done more carefully.

**Why is this important?**
Sepsis kills many newborn babies around the world. Finding the best treatment could save lives. Right now, doctors must choose antibiotics without clear guidance. Better studies would help doctors make better choices."

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Antibiotic Treatments for Newborn Babies with Early-Onset Sepsis

## Rationale

**What is sepsis and why does it matter?**

Sepsis is a very serious infection. It happens when the body fights an infection too hard. This can harm the body's own organs. In newborn babies, sepsis can be deadly.

Sepsis is the third most common cause of death in newborns around the world. This makes it a major health problem. Early-onset sepsis happens in the first three days of a baby's life.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors need to know the best antibiotics to treat newborn sepsis. Antibiotics are medicines that fight infections. But there is not much good research on which antibiotics work best.

This review first came out in 2004. The researchers needed to update it with new studies. They wanted to find out if one antibiotic treatment works better than others.

**What did researchers hope to find?**

The researchers wanted to see if certain antibiotics save more lives. They also wanted to know if some antibiotics cause fewer side effects. This information helps doctors choose the best treatment for sick newborns.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review of other studies. The researchers looked at studies done through August 2020. They found five studies that met their standards.

**Who was in these studies?**

The five studies included 865 newborn babies total. All these babies had early-onset sepsis. This means they got sick in their first three days of life.

**What did the studies compare?**

Each study compared two different antibiotic treatments:
- Study 1: ampicillin plus gentamicin versus benzylpenicillin plus gentamicin
- Study 2: piperacillin plus tazobactam versus amikacin
- Study 3: ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid versus piperacillin plus gentamicin
- Study 4: piperacillin versus ampicillin plus amikacin
- Study 5: ceftazidime versus benzylpenicillin plus gentamicin

**How long did the studies last?**

The review does not state how long babies stayed in each study.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found no clear winner. None of the antibiotic combinations worked better than the others.

**What did they measure?**

They looked at many important outcomes:
- Death from any cause
- Serious side effects or major problems
- Need for breathing support
- Need for heart and blood pressure support
- Kidney damage
- Brain development problems
- Gut disease called necrotising enterocolitis (when gut tissue dies)
- Ear damage from the medicine

**Were there differences between treatments?**

No. The studies showed no difference between any of the antibiotic treatments. All treatments seemed to work about the same.

**What does this mean?**

The researchers cannot say one antibiotic treatment is better than another. More research is needed to find the best treatment.

**How good was the evidence?**

The evidence quality was very low. This means we cannot trust these results very much.

There were two main problems:
- The studies were not done well. They may have shown results that were too positive.
- The studies were small. They did not include enough babies to give clear answers.

**What are the conclusions?**

Doctors still do not know which antibiotic treatment works best for newborn sepsis. Current research cannot prove one treatment is better than another. Better studies with more babies are needed. Until then, doctors must use their best judgment when choosing antibiotics for sick newborns."
10.1002-14651858.CD013839.pub2-pls.txt,"Does surgical removal of the lower leg (amputation) through the knee offer patients improved surgical recovery and better rehabilitation than amputation above the knee? 
Background 
Each year, thousands of people worldwide need to have their lower leg surgically removed (lower limb amputation) due to problems such as blockages in blood vessels (vascular disease), diabetes, and injury. When an amputation is planned, a surgeon needs to decide how high up the leg to go, and therefore how much leg to leave behind. This decision is based on a balance between leaving as much of the leg as possible to improve a person’s ability to walk with an artificial leg (prosthesis) and removing anything that will not survive or go on to heal. If possible, a surgeon will prefer to preserve the knee, as having a working knee of one's own ensures a person’s best chance of walking. In some cases, this is not possible, and currently almost all people in this situation will have an amputation in the middle of the thigh (above the knee). However, another option is an amputation that can be performed through the knee joint itself. This carries potential advantages, as all of the muscles controlling movements of the thighbone are undamaged. A longer remaining leg would be expected to act as a lever to reduce the effort of swinging a prosthetic limb during walking and to aid sitting balance and transfer from bed to chair. By avoiding cutting the muscles, it is possible to minimise the physical trauma of surgery, allowing a procedure with reduced blood loss and less procedure time. In addition, the end of the thighbone and in some cases the knee cap remain. These bones can support the body’s weight at the end of the remaining limb through the same mechanism as kneeling down. On the other hand, some surgeons think that problems with healing may be more common with this approach. It is unclear whether amputation through the knee may therefore be a better operation, allowing improved recovery, greater likelihood of being able to walk with an artificial leg, and better quality of life, or whether it is associated with worse outcomes due to wound healing failure and the need for further surgery. The aim of this review was to look at the best available evidence to see how these operations compare.  
This review searched for studies that looked at whether through‐the‐knee or above‐the‐knee amputation resulted in better wound healing after amputation, improved patient survival, and reduced pain (clinical outcomes), as well as better rates of prosthesis use, walking speed, and quality of life (rehabilitation outcomes). 
Study characteristics and key results 
A thorough search of the available literature was performed (up to 17 February 2021) to find studies comparing through‐knee with above‐knee amputation. We identified no studies comparing these two procedures. 
Certainty of the evidence 
We were unable to assess the certainty of evidence because of the absence of studies included in this review. 
Conclusion 
Due to a lack of randomised trials, we are unable to determine if through‐knee amputations have different outcomes from above‐knee amputations. High‐quality randomised controlled trials are required to provide evidence on this topic. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Comparing Two Types of Leg Amputation: Through the Knee Versus Above the Knee

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**
Some people need to have their lower leg removed by surgery. Doctors call this amputation. This happens when blood vessels get blocked, when diabetes causes serious problems, or after a bad injury.

**Why does this matter to patients?**
When a surgeon removes part of a leg, they must decide where to cut. They want to leave as much leg as possible. A longer leg helps people walk better with a fake leg. The surgeon also needs to make sure the remaining leg will heal well.

**What are the two options?**
The knee is an important joint. If a person keeps their own knee, they have the best chance of walking again. But sometimes the surgeon cannot save the knee. When this happens, doctors usually cut through the middle of the thigh. This is called above-the-knee amputation.

Another choice is to cut through the knee joint itself. This is called through-the-knee amputation. This option has some possible benefits. It leaves the thigh bone longer. All the thigh muscles stay attached and work normally. The longer leg acts like a lever. This makes it easier to swing a fake leg when walking. It also helps with balance when sitting. The person can move from bed to chair more easily.

This type of surgery may be less hard on the body. It causes less blood loss. The operation takes less time. The end of the thigh bone can support body weight, like when you kneel down.

**What is the concern?**
Some doctors worry that through-the-knee amputation may not heal as well. The wound might have more problems. The person might need more surgery later.

**Why was this study needed?**
No one knows which type of amputation is better. Researchers wanted to find out if through-the-knee amputation helps people recover better and walk more easily. Or does it cause more problems with healing?

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**
This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers looked for all existing studies that compared these two types of amputation. They searched medical records and databases carefully. They looked for studies published up to February 17, 2021.

They wanted to find studies that showed:
- How well the wound healed
- How long patients lived
- How much pain patients felt
- How many people could use a fake leg
- How fast people could walk
- How good their quality of life was

## Results

**What were the main results?**
The researchers found no studies comparing these two types of amputation. Not a single study met their standards for good quality research.

**What does this mean?**
Without any studies, we cannot say which amputation is better. We do not know if through-the-knee amputation helps people heal faster. We do not know if it helps people walk better with a fake leg. We also do not know if it causes more healing problems.

**What is needed next?**
Doctors need high-quality studies to answer this question. These studies should compare both types of amputation fairly. They should follow patients over time. They should measure healing, pain, walking ability, and quality of life.

**Conclusion**
Right now, there is no scientific proof to show which type of amputation is better. Both through-the-knee and above-the-knee amputation are used. But we need research to know which one helps patients most. Until then, doctors must make decisions based on their experience and each patient's unique situation."
10.1002-14651858.CD013845.pub2-pls.txt,"Can a dementia medicine (memantine) help people with autism spectrum disorder?
BackgroundAutism spectrum disorder (autism) is a condition that begins in childhood. Core symptoms include persistent difficulties with social communication (e.g. difficulties with back‐and‐forth conversations, communication without words, and in developing and maintaining relationships), and repetitive and restricted interests and behaviours (e.g. repetitive mannerisms, restricted interests and behaviours, resistance to change and sensory sensitivities). Around 1% to 2% of children have autism. Autistic people often have other conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, language impairments (e.g. difficulties understanding and using grammar) and intellectual disability. Autism can have negative impacts on quality of life, school achievement and social relationships. Memantine is a medication traditionally used to treat dementia, but some studies suggest that it may decrease core autistic symptoms. If memantine is being used to change the core symptoms of autism, it is important to assess whether it works and is safe. This review combines the research evidence on the use of memantine in autism. 
Review questionDoes memantine change the core symptoms of autism and related behaviours? 
Search dateThe evidence is current to 14 February 2022. 
Study characteristicsWe found three studies with 204 people that had evaluated the effectiveness of memantine in autism. All studies were randomised controlled trials, meaning participants were randomly allocated to receive either the treatment or a dummy pill (placebo). This is the best design for assessing the effectiveness of treatments. All three studies included children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, with an average age of 9.40 years. We found no studies in adults. The children received memantine (for 12 weeks in two studies and for 24 weeks in one study), and their behaviour was assessed before treatment and immediately after treatment. 
Study funding sourcesOne study was sponsored and funded by a laboratory that makes memantine (Forest). The study sponsor helped to design the study, collect information, analyse and interpret the information, and take the decision to publish the results. The authors of the other two smaller studies said they did not receive any funding; though in one of these studies, Forest Pharmaceuticals provided the medicine for free. 
Key resultsIt is unclear if memantine makes any difference to the core symptoms of autism. Additionally, there may be no difference between memantine and placebo in the occurrence of side effects, language ability, memory, adaptive behaviour or the autism‐related behaviours of hyperactivity and irritability. 
Limitations of the evidenceWe are not confident about the evidence for core symptoms of autism because it comes from only three small studies; because the studies included different types of people and delivered the medicine in different ways; and because the studies did not always provide information about everything we were interested in. Additionally, we have little confidence in the evidence on side effects and language because it comes from only two small studies; and we have little confidence in the evidence on intelligence, memory, adaptive behaviour, hyperactivity and irritability, because it comes from only one small study.

## Plain Title
Can a Memory Drug Called Memantine Help Children with Autism?

## Rationale

**What is autism?**

Autism spectrum disorder (also called autism) starts when a child is young. Children with autism have two main types of challenges:

1. They find it hard to talk and connect with other people. This includes trouble having back-and-forth talks, using body language, and making friends.

2. They do the same things over and over. They may have very strong interests in certain things, not like changes, or be very sensitive to sounds, lights, or touch.

About 1 to 2 out of every 100 children have autism. Many children with autism also have other problems like trouble paying attention, feeling worried, trouble with language, or learning difficulties.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Autism can make life harder for children. It can affect how well they do in school, their friendships, and how they feel about their life. Doctors want to find medicines that can help.

Memantine is a drug that doctors usually give to older people with memory problems (dementia). Some early research suggested memantine might help reduce the main symptoms of autism. Researchers wanted to find out if memantine really works and if it is safe for children with autism.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this?**

Researchers looked at three studies that tested memantine in children with autism. These studies included 204 children total. The average age of the children was about 9 years old. No studies looked at adults with autism.

These were high-quality studies. Each child was randomly chosen to get either memantine or a fake pill (called a placebo). Neither the children nor the doctors knew who got the real medicine. This is the best way to test if a treatment works.

In two studies, children took the medicine for 12 weeks. In one study, children took it for 24 weeks. Researchers checked the children's behavior before and after treatment.

**Who paid for the studies?**

One study was paid for by a company called Forest that makes memantine. This company helped plan the study, collect information, and decide to publish the results. Two smaller studies said they got no money, but in one of these, Forest gave the medicine for free.

## Results

**What did researchers find?**

The studies did not show clear proof that memantine helps children with autism. Here is what the research found:

**Core symptoms of autism:** It is unclear if memantine makes any difference to the main symptoms of autism. The evidence was not strong enough to know for sure.

**Side effects:** Memantine may not cause more side effects than the fake pill. But again, the evidence was limited.

**Other areas:** The studies found memantine may make no difference in:
- How well children use language
- Memory
- Daily living skills (like getting dressed or eating)
- Hyperactivity (being very active or restless)
- Irritability (getting upset easily)

**Why are researchers not sure about these results?**

Researchers have several concerns about this evidence:

1. Only three small studies were done. More research is needed.

2. The studies were different from each other. They included different types of children and gave the medicine in different ways.

3. The studies did not always measure everything researchers wanted to know about.

4. Some information came from only one or two studies, which is not enough to be confident.

**What does this mean?**

Based on current research, doctors cannot say if memantine helps children with autism. The evidence is too limited. More and better studies are needed before doctors can recommend this medicine for autism.

Families should talk with their doctors about all treatment options for autism. Right now, there is not enough proof that memantine works for the core symptoms of autism.

Review question 
Among the available cyclo‐oxygenase inhibitor (COX‐I) drugs (indomethacin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen), which one is the safest and most effective in preventing death and poor outcomes in preterm infants when given prophylactically without the prior knowledge of the presence of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) within the first 72 hours after birth? 
Background 
A PDA is a common complication in preterm or low‐birth weight infants. PDA is an open vascular channel between the lungs and the heart which usually closes shortly after birth. In preterm infants, the PDA frequently remains open and may contribute to life‐threatening complications. COX‐I drugs such as indomethacin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen may prevent a PDA and related poor outcomes. Controversy exists on which of the three COX‐I drugs, if any, improves clinical outcomes in preterm infants. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases for randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) in preterm babies (born at less than 37 weeks into pregnancy) or low‐birthweight (weighing less than 2500 grams) infants where COX‐I drugs were given without the prior knowledge of the presence of a PDA, within the first 72 hours after birth. The included studies compared administration of indomethacin or ibuprofen or acetaminophen versus each other, placebo or no treatment.  
Key results 
This review of 28 clinical trials (3999 preterm infants) found that prophylactic indomethacin probably results in a small reduction in severe brain bleeding, a moderate reduction in death and need for PDA surgery, and may result in a small increase in chronic lung disease. Prophylactic indomethacin likely results in trivial differences in necrotizing enterocolitis, gastrointestinal perforation and cerebral palsy. Prophylactic ibuprofen probably results in a small reduction in severe brain bleeding and a moderate reduction in need for PDA surgery. Prophylactic ibuprofen may result in a moderate reduction in death and trivial differences in chronic lung disease and necrotizing enterocolitis. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of acetaminophen on any of the clinically relevant outcomes.There are currently two ongoing trials on prophylactic use of acetaminophen. 
Certainty of the evidence 
According to GRADE (a method to score the certainty of the trials supporting each outcome), the certainty of the evidence varied from very low to high but was moderate for the most important outcomes of severe brain bleeding and death. 
How up to date is the search evidence 
The search is up to date as of 9 December 2021.
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Testing Drugs to Prevent Death and Health Problems in Babies Born Too Early

## Rationale

### What is the health problem?
Babies born too early (before 37 weeks of pregnancy) often have a heart problem called PDA. PDA stands for patent ductus arteriosus. This is a blood vessel between the heart and lungs that should close after birth. In babies born too early, this blood vessel often stays open. When it stays open, it can cause serious health problems. These problems can be life-threatening.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors want to know if giving certain drugs early can help. These drugs are called COX-I drugs. They include three medicines: indomethacin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen. These drugs may help close the open blood vessel. They may also prevent serious health problems. Doctors need to know which drug works best and is safest for these tiny babies.

### What did researchers want to learn?
Researchers wanted to find out which of these three drugs works best. They wanted to know if giving these drugs in the first 3 days after birth could prevent death and health problems. They gave the drugs before knowing if the baby had PDA or not.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was a review of 28 different studies. The studies included 3,999 babies born too early. Researchers looked at studies where babies were randomly put into different treatment groups. Some babies got indomethacin. Some got ibuprofen. Some got acetaminophen. Some got a fake treatment or no treatment at all.

### Who was in the studies?
The studies included babies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy. They also included babies weighing less than 2,500 grams (about 5.5 pounds). The babies received the drugs within the first 3 days after birth.

### How long did the studies last?
The studies followed babies from birth through their hospital stay. Some studies tracked babies for months or years after.

## Results

### What did the study find about indomethacin?
Indomethacin probably helps reduce serious brain bleeding by a small amount. It moderately reduces death and the need for surgery to close the PDA. However, it may slightly increase chronic lung disease. It likely makes little difference in other gut problems or cerebral palsy (a condition affecting movement).

### What did the study find about ibuprofen?
Ibuprofen probably helps reduce serious brain bleeding by a small amount. It moderately reduces the need for PDA surgery. It may moderately reduce death. It likely makes little difference in chronic lung disease or gut problems.

### What did the study find about acetaminophen?
The researchers are very uncertain about acetaminophen. There is not enough evidence to know if it helps. Two new studies are currently testing acetaminophen.

### Why does this matter?
This research helps doctors make better choices about treating babies born too early. The evidence shows that indomethacin and ibuprofen may help prevent some serious problems. However, each drug has different effects. Doctors can use this information to choose the best treatment for each baby.

### How reliable are these findings?
The quality of evidence varied. For the most important outcomes (brain bleeding and death), the evidence quality was moderate. This means the findings are fairly reliable. More research on acetaminophen is needed.

### When was this information gathered?
Researchers searched for studies up to December 9, 2021."

Key messages 
Metoclopramide did not reduce the risk of vomiting, nausea, or the need for rescue medication when provided prior to intravenous opioids in the emergency department.  
In terms of the severity of nausea, metoclopramide did not help patients any more than placebo (sham treatment). 
What is opioid‐induced emesis? 
Physicians often give patients opioids for pain in emergency departments, but over a third experience the side effects of nausea and vomiting (emesis). Some experts have suggested that taking antiemetics before receiving the opioid (that is, as a prophylactic) could prevent these symptoms from occurring. However, these medications have their own side effects, so it is important to understand whether they are effective and safe before routinely using them. 
What did we want to find out? 
This review looks at whether taking antiemetics (medications to treat or prevent nausea and vomiting) before receiving an intravenous opioid reduces the risk of experiencing nausea and vomiting as side effects. 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies involving adults (aged 16 years or older) who received prophylactic antiemetics compared with either placebo or standard care before receiving an intravenous opioid. 
What did we find? 
We found three studies with a total of 527 patients. All the studies used metoclopramide as the antiemetic. Compared with placebo, metoclopramide did not reduce the risk of vomiting, nausea, or the need for an antiemetic later on. There was also no difference in side effects between those who received antiemetics and those who did not. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
The studies investigated only one medication (metoclopramide) and did not report all the information we were interested in. The intervention probably makes little or no difference in terms of experiencing nausea or vomiting. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
This evidence is up to date to 17 January 2022.

## Plain Title
Does Taking Anti-Sickness Medicine Before Pain Medicine Prevent Nausea and Vomiting in the Emergency Room?

## Rationale

### What is the problem?
When people go to the emergency room with pain, doctors often give them strong pain medicines called opioids through a vein. These medicines work well for pain. But they cause problems for many patients. More than 1 out of 3 people feel sick to their stomach. Some people also throw up. These side effects are called nausea and vomiting.

### Why did researchers do this study?
Some doctors thought giving anti-sickness medicine first might stop these problems. Anti-sickness medicines are called antiemetics. The idea was to give these medicines before the pain medicine. This is called prophylactic treatment. It means preventing a problem before it starts.

However, anti-sickness medicines can cause their own side effects. Researchers needed to find out if these medicines really work. They also needed to know if they are safe. This study looked at whether taking anti-sickness medicine before pain medicine helps patients.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked at three different studies. These studies included 527 adults total. All patients were 16 years old or older. They all went to the emergency room for pain. They all received pain medicine through a vein.

Some patients got anti-sickness medicine first. Other patients got a fake medicine called placebo. A placebo looks like real medicine but has no active ingredients. Patients did not know which one they got. This helps researchers see if the real medicine works.

All three studies used the same anti-sickness medicine. It was called metoclopramide. Researchers compared patients who got metoclopramide to patients who got placebo. They watched to see who felt sick or threw up.

The studies took place in emergency rooms. Patients were in the studies during their emergency room visit.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
The anti-sickness medicine did not help. Patients who took metoclopramide before their pain medicine did not do better than patients who took placebo.

Here is what the researchers found:
- The medicine did not stop vomiting
- The medicine did not stop nausea
- The medicine did not reduce how bad the nausea felt
- Patients still needed rescue medicine later just as often

Rescue medicine means anti-sickness medicine given after nausea starts.

The side effects were the same in both groups. Patients who got the anti-sickness medicine had no more side effects. But they also had no fewer side effects.

### What does this mean?
Taking metoclopramide before pain medicine does not prevent nausea and vomiting. It does not help patients feel better. This means doctors should not routinely give this medicine to prevent these side effects.

### What are the limits of this study?
The researchers only looked at one type of anti-sickness medicine. Other medicines might work differently. The studies did not answer all the questions researchers had. More research is needed with other medicines.

### Conclusion
Based on these studies, giving metoclopramide before pain medicine in the emergency room does not help. It does not prevent nausea or vomiting. Doctors should think carefully before giving this medicine to prevent side effects.

Review question 
Which antibiotic regimen is safer and more effective in treating neonates (newborns) and children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia? 
Background 
Hospital‐acquired pneumonia is an inflammation of the tissue of one or both lungs caused by an infection that occurs during a hospital stay (i.e. 48 hours or more after hospital admission). It is one of the most common hospital‐acquired infections in children worldwide, and is associated with a high death rate. Most of our understanding of hospital‐acquired pneumonia in children is drawn from adult studies. To our knowledge this is the first review with meta‐analysis that assesses the benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens in newborns and children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to February 2021.
Study characteristics 
We included four trials randomising 84 children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia to different antibiotic regimens. Three trials were multicentre trials from the USA, Latin America, Europe, and South Africa. The South African trial included one site in Malaysia. Each of the four included trials compared different antibiotic regimens, as follows: cefepime versus ceftazidime; linezolid versus vancomycin; meropenem versus cefotaxime; and ceftobiprole versus cephalosporin. 
Study funding sources 
Three trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies (Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Pharmacia Corp, and Basilea Pharmaceutica International Ltd.), indicating a possible risk of bias related to a vested interest risk. 
Key results 
Each of the four included trials compared different antibiotic regimens, as follows: cefepime versus ceftazidime; linezolid versus vancomycin; meropenem versus cefotaxime; and ceftobiprole versus cephalosporin. 
Only one trial reported our primary outcomes of death from all causes and serious adverse events (major complications). Three trials reported our secondary outcome of treatment failure. Two trials primarily included community‐acquired pneumonia and hospitalised children with bacterial infections, hence the children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia constituted only subgroups of the total study populations. 
Where outcomes were reported, the certainty of the evidence was very low for each of the comparisons. We were unable to draw any meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. 
None of the included trials assessed health‐related quality of life, pneumonia‐related death, or non‐serious adverse events (minor complications). 
Conclusions 
The available evidence does not suggest that one antibiotic regimen is safer and more effective than another in treating newborns and children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia. Further research is needed. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of evidence is very low. All four included trials had high risk of bias (i.e. the studies were designed in such a way that the results may have been skewed). In addition, the included trials involved few participants, which is likely to have led to inaccurate results. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Antibiotics for Lung Infections That Children Get While in the Hospital

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Antibiotics to Treat Lung Infections in Babies and Children Who Get Sick While in the Hospital

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some children get lung infections while staying in the hospital. Doctors call this hospital-acquired pneumonia. This happens when a child has been in the hospital for 2 days or more and then gets an infection in one or both lungs. The lungs become swollen and inflamed.

This type of lung infection is very common in children around the world. It is also very serious. Many children can die from these infections.

**Why was this study needed?**

Most of what doctors know about these lung infections comes from studies in adults, not children. Children's bodies work differently than adult bodies. Doctors need to know which antibiotics work best and are safest for babies and children.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to find out which antibiotic medicines work better to treat these lung infections. They also wanted to know which antibiotics are safer for babies and children. They looked at different types of antibiotics to compare them.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at 4 different studies that had already been done. These 4 studies tested different antibiotics in children with lung infections.

**Who was in these studies?**

The 4 studies included 84 children total. These were babies (newborns) and children who got lung infections while in the hospital.

**Where did these studies take place?**

Three studies were done in many places around the world. These places included the United States, Latin America, Europe, and South Africa. One study site was in Malaysia.

**What antibiotics were compared?**

Each study compared 2 different antibiotics:
- Study 1: cefepime versus ceftazidime
- Study 2: linezolid versus vancomycin
- Study 3: meropenem versus cefotaxime
- Study 4: ceftobiprole versus cephalosporin

**When was this review done?**

Researchers looked for studies up to February 2021.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers could not tell which antibiotic worked better. The studies did not give clear answers.

**What information was reported?**

Only 1 study reported how many children died. Only 1 study reported serious problems (major complications). Three studies reported when treatment did not work.

Two of the studies mainly looked at children who got lung infections outside the hospital. Only some children in those studies had hospital lung infections.

**What information was missing?**

None of the studies looked at:
- How children felt about their quality of life
- Deaths caused by the lung infection specifically
- Minor problems or side effects from the medicines

**What do the results mean?**

The evidence does not show that one antibiotic is better or safer than another. The quality of the evidence was very low. This means the results may not be reliable.

**Why was the evidence quality low?**

All 4 studies had problems with how they were designed. The results might not be accurate. Also, the studies were very small. They only included 84 children total. Small studies often give less reliable results.

Three studies were paid for by drug companies. This means the results might favor certain medicines.

**What are the conclusions?**

Researchers cannot say which antibiotic works best for babies and children with hospital lung infections. More and better studies are needed. These studies should include more children. They should be designed more carefully to give reliable answers.

Doctors still need better information to choose the best and safest antibiotics for children with these serious lung infections."
10.1002-14651858.CD013870.pub2-pls.txt,"What are the benefits and risks of light therapy for treating atopic eczema (also known as eczema or atopic dermatitis)? 
Key messages 
Narrowband (NB) ultraviolet B (UVB), compared to placebo (a sham treatment), may improve eczema severity (including itch) and may not affect the number of people leaving a study because of unwanted effects. 
We were unable to confidently draw conclusions for other phototherapy (light therapy) treatments. 
Future research needs to assess longer term effectiveness and safety of NB‐UVB and other forms of phototherapy for eczema. 
What is eczema? 
Eczema is a condition that results in dry, itchy patches of inflamed skin. Eczema typically starts in childhood, but can improve with age. Eczema is caused by a combination of genetics and environmental factors, which lead to skin barrier dysfunction. Eczema can negatively impact quality of life, and the societal cost is significant. 
How is eczema treated? 
Eczema treatments are often creams or ointments that reduce itch and redness, applied directly to the skin. If these are unsuccessful, systemic medicines that affect the whole body, or phototherapy are options. Phototherapy can be UVB, ultraviolet A (UVA), or photochemotherapy (PUVA), where phototherapy is given alongside substances that increase sensitivity to UV light. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out whether phototherapy was better than no treatment or other types of treatment for treating eczema, and whether it caused unwanted effects. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that investigated phototherapy compared with no treatment, placebo, other forms of phototherapy, or another type of eczema treatment. Studies could include people of all ages, who had eczema diagnosed by a healthcare professional. 
We compared and summarised the results of the studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence. 
What did we find? 
We found 32 studies, involving 1219 people with eczema (average age: 28 years), who were recruited from dermatology clinics. Most studies assessed people with skin type II to III (which is classed as white to medium skin colour), and moderate to severe eczema, with which they had lived for many years. Studies included similar numbers of males and females. 
The studies were conducted in Europe, Asia, and Egypt (setting was not reported by seven studies), and lasted, on average, for 13 weeks. Almost half of the studies reported their source of funding; two were linked to commercial sponsors. 
Our included studies mostly assessed NB‐UVB, followed by UVA1, then broadband ultraviolet B; fewer studies investigated other types of phototherapy. The studies compared these treatments to placebo, or no treatment, another type of phototherapy, different doses of the same sort of phototherapy, or other eczema treatments applied to the skin or taken by tablet. 
None of the studies investigated excimer lamp (a source of UV radiation) or heliotherapy (the use of natural sunlight), that were other light therapies in which we were interested. 
What are the main results of our review? 
When compared to placebo, NB‐UVB may:
‐ improve signs of eczema assessed by a healthcare professional (1 study, 41 people);
‐ increase the number of people reporting less severe itching (1 study, 41 people);
‐ increase the number of people reporting moderate or greater improvement of eczema, measured by the Investigator Global Assessment scale (IGA), a 5‐point scale that measures improvement in eczema symptoms (1 study, 40 people); and 
‐ have no effect on the rate of people withdrawing from treatment due to unwanted effects (3 studies, 89 people). 
None of the studies assessing NB‐UVB against placebo measured health‐related quality of life. 
We do not know if NB‐UVB (compared with UVA1 or PUVA) or UVA1 (compared with PUVA) has an effect on the following: 
‐ signs of eczema assessed by a healthcare professional;
‐ patient‐reported eczema symptoms;
‐ IGA;
‐ health‐related quality of life; and
‐ withdrawals due to unwanted effects.
This is because either we are not confident in the evidence, or they were not reported.
We did not identify any studies that investigated UVA1 or PUVA compared with no treatment.
Some studies reported that phototherapy caused some unwanted effects, including skin reactions or irritation, UV burn, worsening of eczema, and skin infections. However, these did not occur in most people. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the evidence is limited, mainly because only a few studies could be included in each comparison, and the studies generally involved only small numbers of people. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to January 2021.
","# Plain Language Summary: Light Therapy for Eczema

## Plain Title
Does light therapy help treat eczema?

## Rationale

### What is eczema?
Eczema is a skin condition. It causes dry, itchy, and red patches on the skin. The skin becomes inflamed and uncomfortable. Eczema usually starts when people are children. Sometimes it gets better as people grow older. Sometimes it does not.

### What causes eczema?
Eczema happens because of two things. First, genes that parents pass to their children. Second, things in the environment around us. These two things together damage the skin's protective barrier. When the skin barrier does not work well, eczema develops.

### Why is eczema a problem?
Eczema can make life harder for people who have it. The itching and skin problems affect daily activities. It can cost a lot of money to treat. It affects many people around the world.

### How do doctors usually treat eczema?
Doctors first try creams or ointments. People put these directly on their skin. These treatments help reduce itching and redness. If creams do not work well enough, doctors try other options. These include medicines that work throughout the whole body. Another option is light therapy.

### What is light therapy?
Light therapy uses special light to treat skin. Doctors call this phototherapy. There are different types. One type uses ultraviolet B light, or UVB. Another uses ultraviolet A light, or UVA. A third type combines light with special medicines. These medicines make the skin more sensitive to light. This combination is called PUVA.

### Why study light therapy?
Researchers wanted to know if light therapy works for eczema. They wanted to know if it is safe. They wanted to compare it to other treatments.

## Trial Design

### How is this study designed?
Researchers looked for studies about light therapy for eczema. They searched for studies that compared light therapy to other treatments. They also looked for studies comparing light therapy to no treatment or fake treatment.

### Who was in these studies?
The studies included 1,219 people with eczema. The average age was 28 years. Studies included both men and women in similar numbers. A doctor had diagnosed all these people with eczema. Most people had white to medium skin color. Most had moderate to severe eczema. They had lived with eczema for many years.

### Where did these studies happen?
Studies took place in Europe, Asia, and Egypt. Seven studies did not say where they happened.

### How long did studies last?
On average, studies lasted 13 weeks. This is about 3 months.

### What treatments did researchers study?
Most studies looked at narrowband UVB light. This is called NB-UVB. Other studies looked at UVA1 light. Some looked at broadband UVB. Researchers compared these light treatments to fake treatment, no treatment, other types of light therapy, or other eczema medicines.

## Results

### What were the main results?

Researchers found 32 studies to review.

### NB-UVB compared to fake treatment
When people used NB-UVB instead of fake treatment, several things happened:

**Eczema got better.** Doctors saw improvement in eczema signs. One study with 41 people showed this.

**Itching improved.** More people said their itching was less severe. One study with 41 people found this.

**Overall improvement happened.** More people reported their eczema was moderately better or much better. Doctors used a special 5-point scale to measure this. One study with 40 people showed this result.

**Side effects did not cause people to quit.** The same number of people stopped treatment whether they got real light therapy or fake treatment. Three studies with 89 people showed this.

**Quality of life was not measured.** None of these studies asked people about their quality of life.

### Other comparisons
Researchers could not draw clear conclusions about other light therapy comparisons. This includes NB-UVB compared to UVA1 or PUVA. It also includes UVA1 compared to PUVA. The studies either did not report these results or the evidence was not strong enough.

### Side effects
Some people had unwanted effects from light therapy. These included skin reactions, irritation, sunburn from UV light, worsening eczema, and skin infections. However, most people did not have these problems.

### What does this mean?
NB-UVB light therapy may help improve eczema. It may reduce itching. It probably does not cause more people to stop treatment because of side effects. More research is needed. Future studies should look at whether light therapy works over longer periods. They should also study safety more carefully.

### Limitations
The evidence has some weaknesses. Only a few studies looked at each comparison. Most studies included only small numbers of people. This makes it harder to be confident about the results.

– Rituximab may offer moderate‐to‐large benefit against a range of other medicines in preventing relapses in relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). Compared with no medicines, the desirable effects would be greater. 
– There is limited information to determine the effect of rituximab for preventing disability worsening in all forms of MS.  
– Serious harmful effects are relatively rare in people with MS making them difficult to study, and they were also not well reported in studies. 
What is the issue? 
Rituximab is a medicine administered by intravenous (by a vein) infusion that can suppress certain immune cells. The immune system fights infections and consists of many immune cells; it is affected in MS. 
Rituximab is currently used in many low‐ to middle‐income countries that have major barriers for accessing approved medicines for MS. However, rituximab is not always reimbursed by health systems because it is not licensed for MS by marketing authorities.  
Rituximab is considered a feasible treatment option as it is considered a highly effective treatment (similar to other approved medicines used to treat MS) but has considerably lower cost and less frequent dosing. Treatment with rituximab requires specialist care and infusion facilities, but other approved medicines do too. 
What did we want to find out? 
We aimed to investigate the beneficial and unwanted effects of rituximab for people with MS, when is used as a 'first choice' or as 'switching' (in other words, used when other medicines do not work well or become contraindicated). 
We wanted to find out if rituximab was better than other medicines to prevent disability worsening and recurrence of relapse, and to improve well‐being. 
We also wanted to find out if rituximab was associated with any unwanted or harmful effects, for example, serious harmful effects, common infections, cancer, and mortality (death). 
What did we do?  
We searched for studies that investigated rituximab compared with all other approved medicines for MS. We searched the literature up to January 2021. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and quality. 
What did we find?  
We found 15 studies that involved about 16,000 people with MS and lasted one or two years. The biggest study was of 6421 people and the smallest study was of 27 people. The studies were conducted worldwide; most originated from high‐income countries, six from the Swedish MS register. Pharmaceutical companies funded two included studies. 
Main results 
Rituximab as a first choice treatment in relapsing MS: 
– likely results in a large reduction in the number of people who have relapses compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (evidence from one study in 335 people); 
– may reduce the number of people who have relapses compared with dimethyl fumarate and natalizumab, but the evidence is uncertain (evidence from one study). 
There was no usable information on disability worsening, well‐being, and serious harmful effects. 
Rituximab as a first choice treatment in progressive MS: 
– likely results in little to no difference in the number of participants who have disability worsening over 24 months compared with pretend treatment (evidence from one study of 439 people); 
– the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of rituximab on well‐being and serious harmful effects. 
Rituximab as 'switching' for relapsing MS: 
– likely results in a large reduction in the number of people who have relapses compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (evidence from one study of 1383 people), and fingolimod (evidence from one study of 256 people). The evidence is very uncertain on the comparison of rituximab with natalizumab; 
– the evidence is very uncertain on disability worsening;
– likely increases slightly the number of people who have common infections compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (evidence from one study of 5477 people), and natalizumab (evidence from two studies of 5001 people). The evidence is uncertain for the comparisons of rituximab with fingolimod and ocrelizumab. 
There was no usable information on well‐being and serious harmful effects.
Rituximab as 'switching' for progressive MS 
Only three small studies investigated rituximab in secondary progressive MS. The evidence is uncertain about the effect of rituximab on disability worsening, well‐being, and serious harmful effects. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
– Limited confidence about the effect of rituximab on disability worsening in all forms of MS. 
– Limited information to determine the effect of rituximab for progressive forms of MS. 
– Studies were short with a median duration of 24 months.
How up to date is the evidence? 
This review is up to day to 31 January 2021.
","# Plain Language Summary: Rituximab for Multiple Sclerosis

## Plain Title
Testing Rituximab as a Treatment for People with Multiple Sclerosis

## Rationale

**What is multiple sclerosis?**
Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is a disease that affects the brain and nerves. In MS, the body's defense system attacks its own nerves by mistake. This can cause many problems for patients. People may have trouble walking, feel very tired, or have pain. Some people have attacks called relapses when symptoms get worse.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors use many medicines to treat MS. These medicines can be very costly. Many people around the world cannot get these medicines. Rituximab is a medicine that might work as well as other MS medicines. It costs much less money. Doctors give rituximab through a tube into a vein. It works by stopping certain cells in the body's defense system.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Rituximab is not approved for MS in many countries. This means health systems often will not pay for it. Researchers wanted to find out if rituximab really works for MS. They wanted to know if it helps prevent relapses. They wanted to know if it stops MS from getting worse. They also wanted to know if rituximab is safe.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at 15 different studies. These studies included about 16,000 people with MS. The studies lasted one or two years each. Most studies were done in wealthy countries. Six studies used data from Sweden.

**Who was in the studies?**
The studies included adults with MS. Some people had relapsing MS. This means their symptoms come and go. Other people had progressive MS. This means their symptoms slowly get worse over time. Some people were taking MS medicine for the first time. Other people were switching from a different medicine.

**What did researchers compare?**
They compared rituximab to other MS medicines. These included interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, dimethyl fumarate, natalizumab, fingolimod, and ocrelizumab. They also compared rituximab to fake treatment.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

**For people with relapsing MS taking medicine for the first time:**
Rituximab likely helps a lot. Fewer people had relapses compared to interferon beta or glatiramer acetate. One study looked at 335 people. Rituximab may also reduce relapses compared to dimethyl fumarate and natalizumab. But researchers are less sure about this.

The studies did not give good information about other important questions. Researchers could not tell if rituximab stops disability from getting worse. They could not tell if it helps people feel better overall. They could not tell if it causes serious harm.

**For people with progressive MS taking medicine for the first time:**
Rituximab likely does not help much. One study looked at 439 people for 24 months. About the same number of people got worse with rituximab as with fake treatment.

Researchers are very unsure about side effects and quality of life.

**For people with relapsing MS switching medicines:**
Rituximab likely helps a lot. One study of 1,383 people showed fewer relapses than with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate. One study of 256 people showed fewer relapses than with fingolimod.

Rituximab may cause slightly more common infections. This was seen compared to interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, and natalizumab. Common infections include colds and urinary tract infections.

Researchers are unsure if rituximab stops disability from getting worse.

**For people with progressive MS switching medicines:**
Only three small studies looked at this. Researchers cannot draw clear conclusions.

**What do these results mean?**
Rituximab may help prevent relapses in relapsing MS. It may work as well as or better than some other medicines. It costs less money. This could help more people get treatment.

However, researchers need more information. They need longer studies. They need to know more about progressive MS. They need to know more about serious side effects. Serious side effects are rare, which makes them hard to study.

**How current is this information?**
Researchers looked at all studies published through January 2021."
10.1002-14651858.CD013876.pub3-pls.txt,"Interventions for the treatment of persistent smell disorders (olfactory dysfunction) after COVID‐19 infection 
Why this is important 
The sense of smell is critical to one's enjoyment of odours and tastes, and is important for safety. During the COVID‐19 pandemic there has been an increasing focus on change in sense of smell as one of the early symptoms associated with infection. This can be a reduction, change or complete loss of the sense of smell. For most people this is temporary, however for some this lasts weeks or even months. If a person has lost their sense of smell for a long time (over four weeks after having COVID‐19), we do not know if there are any treatments that might help it to recover.  
How we identified and assessed the evidence 
We searched the medical literature, identifying relevant studies and summarising the results. We assessed the quality of the studies as well as the certainty of the evidence. Factors influencing this included the size of the studies, the methods used to perform them and how results were reported by researchers. Based on this, we classed the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. 
What we found 
We found two small studies to include in the review, including a total of 30 people. All participants had problems with their sense of smell that had lasted for at least four weeks, and started after a COVID‐19 infection. Problems with the sense of smell were identified using special smell identification tests carried out by the research team. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: those who would receive treatment and those who would not.  
The treatment in one study was a course of corticosteroid tablets ('systemic') and nasal irrigation (with a wash consisting of a mix of corticosteroids, decongestant and an agent that breaks down mucus). The second study used a course of a supplement known as palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin.  
Systemic corticosteroids and nasal irrigation (intranasal corticosteroids/decongestant/mucolytic) compared to no treatment 
We do not know whether corticosteroid tablets with nasal irrigation is better or worse than no treatment at: 
 ‐ restoring the sense of smell back to normal after 40 days; ‐ changing the sense of smell after 40 days; ‐ causing any unwanted side effects. 
This is because the evidence that we found was of very low certainty, mainly due to the fact that only one study was identified and it included a small number of patients. 
Palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin compared to no treatment 
We do not know whether palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin is better or worse than no treatment at: 
 ‐ restoring the sense of smell back to normal after 30 days; ‐ changing the sense of smell after 30 days; ‐ causing any unwanted side effects. 
This is because the evidence that we found was of very low certainty, mainly due to the fact that only one study was identified and it included a small number of patients. 
We did find a number of other studies that are being carried out, but no results from these studies are yet available to be included in this review. 
What this means 
It is unclear whether using corticosteroids with nasal irrigation, or using a palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin supplement, might treat problems with the sense of smell after COVID‐19, or whether these treatments can potentially cause harm. 
Other treatments are under investigation. This review is a 'living systematic review', meaning that we will keep checking for new studies that might be relevant, and the review will be continually updated when any extra results are available. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to October 2021.
","# Plain Language Summary: Treatments for Long-Lasting Smell Problems After COVID-19

## Plain Title
Can Any Treatments Help People Who Lost Their Sense of Smell After Having COVID-19?

## Rationale

### What is the problem?
Your sense of smell helps you enjoy food and scents. It also keeps you safe by warning you of dangers like smoke or spoiled food.

Many people who get COVID-19 lose their sense of smell. For most people, their sense of smell comes back quickly. But some people have smell problems that last for weeks or months.

### Why did researchers do this study?
Doctors wanted to know if any treatments could help people whose sense of smell did not come back. They looked for treatments that might work for people who had smell problems for more than four weeks after getting COVID-19.

### What did researchers want to learn?
The researchers wanted to find out if certain treatments could help restore the sense of smell. They also wanted to know if these treatments were safe.

## Trial Design

### How did researchers study this?
Researchers looked for all studies about treatments for smell loss after COVID-19. They found two small studies with 30 people total.

### Who was in these studies?
All people in the studies had lost their sense of smell for at least four weeks. Their smell problems started after they had COVID-19. Doctors tested their sense of smell using special smell tests.

### What treatments did researchers test?
The studies tested two different treatments:

**Study 1:** Some people took steroid pills. They also rinsed their nose with a special wash. This wash had steroids, a decongestant, and a substance that breaks down mucus. Other people got no treatment.

**Study 2:** Some people took two supplements called palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin. Other people got no treatment.

### How long did the studies last?
One study lasted 40 days. The other study lasted 30 days.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

**For steroid pills with nose rinses:**
Researchers do not know if this treatment helps or not. They do not know if it restores normal smell. They do not know if it changes smell in any way. They do not know if it causes side effects.

**For the supplements (palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin):**
Researchers do not know if these supplements help or not. They do not know if they restore normal smell. They do not know if they change smell in any way. They do not know if they cause side effects.

### Why are the results unclear?
The evidence is very uncertain. This is because only one small study tested each treatment. The studies had very few people in them. This makes it hard to know if the results are reliable.

### What does this mean for patients?
Right now, doctors cannot say if these treatments work for smell loss after COVID-19. They also cannot say if these treatments are safe or cause harm.

### What happens next?
Researchers found other studies that are still being done. Results from these studies are not ready yet. This review will be updated when new information becomes available. This means researchers will keep looking for new studies and add them to the review.

### How current is this information?
This review includes all studies found up to October 2021.

### Main conclusions
More research is needed. The current evidence is too limited to recommend any specific treatment for long-lasting smell problems after COVID-19."
10.1002-14651858.CD013877.pub3-pls.txt,"Interventions for the prevention of persistent smell disorders (olfactory dysfunction) after COVID‐19 infection 
Why this is important 
COVID‐19 has been found to cause problems with the sense of smell. Sometimes this is a reduction in the ability to smell things, and sometimes it is a complete loss of the sense of smell. For many people this recovers in a short time, but for others it may last for weeks or months. This review considers whether there are treatments that people might take as soon as they have lost their sense of smell (within four weeks of the symptoms starting), to try and stop this becoming a long‐standing problem. 
How we identified and assessed the evidence 
We searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature to summarise the results. We also looked at how certain the evidence was, considering things like the size of the studies and how they were carried out. Based on this, we classed the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. 
What we found 
We found five studies that had been completed. 
Intranasal corticosteroids compared to no treatment  
Three studies looked at this treatment. 
Nasal corticosteroid spray might make little or no difference to the sense of smell when measured with specific tests (rather than when asking people about their sense of smell). 
The rest of the evidence was of very low certainty, so we do not know whether a nasal corticosteroid spray is better or worse than no treatment at: 
‐ helping the sense of smell get back to normal (either people feeling that their sense of smell is back to normal, or having a normal sense of smell according to specific tests); 
‐ making people feel that their sense of smell has improved;
‐ causing any unwanted side effects.
Intranasal corticosteroid drops compared to placebo (dummy treatment) 
One study looked at this treatment.
Intranasal corticosteroid drops might not make any difference to the number of people who think their sense of smell has recovered at 30 days.  
We did find a number of other studies that are being carried out, but no results from these studies were available yet to be included in this review. 
What this means 
We do not know whether using a nasal corticosteroid spray or nasal drops has any benefit in preventing longer‐term loss of the sense of smell that is related to COVID‐19, or whether they may cause any harm. This review is a 'living systematic review' ‐ meaning that we will keep checking for new studies that might be relevant, and the review will be continually updated when any extra results are available. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to October 2021.
","# Plain Language Summary: Treatments to Prevent Long-Term Smell Loss After COVID-19

## Plain Title
Can treatments prevent long-lasting smell problems in people who lost their sense of smell from COVID-19?

## Rationale

### What is the problem?
COVID-19 can cause people to lose their sense of smell. Some people cannot smell things as well as before. Other people cannot smell anything at all. For many people, their sense of smell comes back quickly. But for some people, smell problems last for weeks or months.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors wanted to know if early treatment could help. They looked for treatments people could use right away. The goal was to stop smell loss from becoming a long-term problem. They studied treatments given within four weeks of losing smell.

### What treatment was studied?
The main treatment studied was corticosteroid medicine. This medicine goes into the nose. It can be a spray or drops. Doctors use corticosteroids to reduce swelling. They thought this might help the sense of smell come back faster.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was a review study. Researchers looked at all medical studies they could find. They wanted to see what other scientists had learned. They found five completed studies to review.

### Who was in these studies?
The studies included people who lost their sense of smell from COVID-19. The studies looked at adults with this problem.

### What did researchers compare?
Some studies compared nose spray with no treatment. One study compared nose drops with fake treatment (called placebo). Placebo means dummy drops that contain no real medicine.

### How long did the studies last?
The studies checked people's sense of smell at different times. Some checked at 30 days. Others checked at different time points.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

**Nose spray with corticosteroids:**
Three studies looked at this treatment. The nose spray might make little or no difference. This was based on smell tests done by doctors.

Researchers are not sure about other results. The evidence was very weak. They do not know if nose spray:
- Helps smell return to normal
- Makes people feel their smell improved
- Causes any bad side effects

**Nose drops with corticosteroids:**
One study looked at this treatment. The nose drops might not help. About the same number of people got better with drops or without them. This was measured at 30 days.

### What does this mean for patients?
Right now, doctors do not know if these treatments work. They do not know if nose sprays or drops help prevent long-term smell loss from COVID-19. They also do not know if these treatments cause harm.

### What happens next?
This review will continue. It is called a ""living review."" This means researchers will keep looking for new studies. When new results come out, they will add them to the review. The review will be updated over time.

### How current is this information?
The researchers looked at all studies available through October 2021.

### Why is more research needed?
The studies done so far were small. The evidence was weak. Doctors need bigger and better studies. This will help them know if these treatments really work. It will also show if the treatments are safe."
10.1002-14651858.CD014067.pub2-pls.txt,"Do synbiotics prevent necrotising enterocolitis in very preterm or very low birth weight infants? 
Background 
Very preterm (born more than eight weeks early) and very low birth weight (less than 1.5 kg) infants are at risk of developing necrotising enterocolitis, a severe condition where some of the lining of the infant's bowel becomes inflamed, and the cells of this tissue die. This condition is associated with death, serious infection, and long‐term disability, as well as developmental problems. 
What did we want to find out? 
One way to help prevent necrotising enterocolitis may be to add synbiotics (combinations of probiotic bacteria or yeasts plus non‐digestible sugars to support probiotic growth and colonisation) to milk feeds. We wanted to find out whether synbiotics might benefit very preterm and very low birth weight infants. Our outcomes of interest included necrotising enterocolitis, death from any cause, serious infection, duration of hospitalisation since birth and neurodevelopmental outcomes. 
What did we do? 
For our Cochrane Review, we searched several important databases to identify randomized controlled trials that investigated the use of synbiotics for preventing necrotising enterocolitis in very preterm and very low birth weight infants. We used standard Cochrane methods to conduct our review and perform our analyses. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. 
What did we find? 
We found six trials with a total of 925 infant participants. Trials were mostly small, and most had design flaws that might have biased their findings. 
Main results 
Combined analyses showed that giving synbiotics to very preterm or very low birth weight infants may reduce the risk of necrotising enterocolitis and death. Synbiotics may have little or no effect in reducing the risk of serious infection, but the evidence is very uncertain. None of the studies that we identified assessed the effect of synbiotics on disability or developmental outcomes. 
What are the limitations of this evidence? 
Although the evidence from randomised controlled trials can potentially be of high certainty, the methods used in our review's included trials may have introduced biases that exaggerated the benefits of giving synbiotics to very preterm and very low birth weight infants. Also, because most of the trials were small, the effect estimates for some outcomes were imprecise. For these reasons, we graded down the certainty of the evidence. All evidence in our review is of low or very low certainty. 
There is low‐certainty evidence that synbiotics prevent necrotising enterocolitis and death from any cause. There is very low‐certainty evidence that synbiotics may have little or no effect in preventing serious infection. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
We conducted our database searches on 17 June 2021.
","# Plain Language Summary: Can Synbiotics Prevent a Serious Bowel Disease in Very Premature Babies?

## Plain Title

Can giving synbiotics to very premature or very small babies prevent a serious bowel disease?

## Rationale

**What is the problem?**

Some babies are born very early (more than 8 weeks before their due date). Some babies are born very small (less than 1.5 kg or about 3 pounds). These babies can get a serious bowel disease. The disease is called necrotising enterocolitis. In this disease, parts of the baby's bowel become swollen. The tissue in the bowel can die. This disease can cause death. It can cause serious infections. It can lead to problems with how the baby grows and learns.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Researchers wanted to find a way to prevent this bowel disease. They thought synbiotics might help. Synbiotics are a mix of two things. First, they contain good bacteria or yeasts called probiotics. Second, they contain special sugars. These sugars help the good bacteria grow in the baby's gut. Researchers added synbiotics to the milk that babies drink. They wanted to see if this would keep babies healthy.

**Why might synbiotics work?**

The good bacteria in synbiotics may protect the baby's bowel. The special sugars help these good bacteria grow strong. Together, they may stop the harmful swelling in the bowel.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this?**

Researchers looked for studies that tested synbiotics in very premature or very small babies. They found 6 studies. These studies included 925 babies in total. In these studies, some babies got synbiotics added to their milk. Other babies did not get synbiotics. Researchers then compared the two groups of babies.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included babies who were born very early. They also included babies who weighed very little at birth. The studies looked at both boys and girls.

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies followed babies from birth until they left the hospital. Some studies also checked on babies after they went home.

## Results

**What did researchers find?**

Researchers combined the results from all 6 studies. They found that synbiotics may help prevent the serious bowel disease. Babies who got synbiotics had less risk of getting necrotising enterocolitis. Synbiotics may also reduce the risk of death from any cause.

Synbiotics may not help prevent serious infections. But researchers are not sure about this finding. The evidence was very weak.

None of the studies looked at how babies grow and learn over time. So researchers do not know if synbiotics help with development.

**How good is this evidence?**

The evidence is not very strong. The studies had some problems in how they were done. These problems may have made synbiotics look better than they really are. Also, most studies were small. This means the results may not be exact. Because of these issues, researchers rated the evidence as low quality or very low quality.

**What does this mean?**

Synbiotics might help prevent serious bowel disease in very premature babies. They might also reduce the risk of death. But more research is needed. Future studies should be larger. They should be done more carefully. They should also look at how babies develop as they grow.

**How recent is this information?**

Researchers searched for studies up to June 17, 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD014201-pls.txt,"Regular clotting factor replacement therapy to prevent joint damage in people living with severe hemophilia A or B 
Review question 
Should people, who have previously been treated for joint bleeding, be given regular preventative treatment with clotting factor concentrates to manage their condition? 
Background 
Hemophilia A and B are X‐linked inherited bleeding disorders in which bleeding  into joints is a major problem. Repeated joint bleeds can lead to affected joints (commonly referred to as 'target joints') becoming damaged and painful, with limited movement. Currently, bleeding is treated and prevented with plasma‐derived or recombinant clotting factor concentrates, and more recently non‐clotting factor formulations. This review looked at how useful and effective different clotting factor treatment strategies are for preventing joint bleeding and other outcomes in previously treated people with hemophilia A or B. 
Search date 
Date of last search: 24 February 2021.
Study characteristics 
This review includes 10 randomised controlled trials. Eight had treatment arms that compared the regular use of clotting factor concentrates to prevent joint bleeds with different dosing schemes to identify regimens that may be better; four had treatment arms that compared the regular use of factor concentrates to prevent bleeds to their 'on demand' use to treat bleeds once they occur (two trials had multiple arms and were included in both comparisons). 
Key results 
In people living with hemophilia A or B previously treated for joint bleeding or with existing joint damage, preventive therapy may reduce the number of joint bleeds compared to 'on‐demand therapy'. This reduction in bleeds may lead to an improvement in joint function, pain, and quality of life. However, preventive therapy is linked to an increased use of factor concentrates and therefore higher treatment costs. Further studies are needed to establish the best preventive course of treatment in terms of starting time, frequency and dose level. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Overall, the certainty of the evidence was judged to be low because of different types of bias that could have affected the results. Future research might have an important role in changing our confidence in these results. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Does Regular Treatment with Clotting Medicine Prevent Joint Damage Better Than Treating Bleeds Only When They Happen in People with Severe Hemophilia?

## Rationale

**What is hemophilia?**
Hemophilia A and B are bleeding disorders that run in families. People with hemophilia are missing a protein that helps blood clot. This means they bleed more easily and for longer than other people.

**Why is this a problem?**
Bleeding into joints is a major problem for people with hemophilia. The joints most often affected are knees, elbows, and ankles. When bleeding happens in the same joint many times, that joint can become damaged. These damaged joints are called ""target joints."" Over time, target joints become painful and hard to move. This makes daily activities difficult.

**What was the goal of this study?**
Researchers wanted to find out the best way to treat people with hemophilia. They looked at two main approaches:
- Giving clotting medicine on a regular schedule to prevent bleeds before they happen
- Giving clotting medicine only when a bleed occurs

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors need to know which treatment approach works best. Regular treatment might prevent joint damage. But it uses more medicine and costs more money. The researchers wanted to see if the benefits were worth the extra cost.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
The researchers looked at 10 studies that had already been done. These studies were randomized controlled trials. This means patients were put into different treatment groups by chance. This type of study gives reliable results.

**Who was in the studies?**
All patients had hemophilia A or B. They had been treated for joint bleeding before. Some already had joint damage. The studies included both children and adults.

**What treatments were compared?**
Eight studies compared different schedules of regular preventive treatment. They looked at different doses and timing. Four studies compared regular preventive treatment to on-demand treatment. Two studies looked at both types of comparisons.

**How long did the studies last?**
The length of time varied across the different studies.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

Regular preventive treatment may work better than on-demand treatment in several ways:
- Fewer bleeds into joints
- Better joint function
- Less joint pain
- Better quality of life

However, regular preventive treatment has some downsides:
- Uses more clotting medicine
- Costs more money

**How strong is this evidence?**
The researchers rated the quality of evidence as low. This means we cannot be completely sure about the results. Some problems with how the studies were done could have affected the findings. Future research might change what we know.

**What does this mean for patients?**
For people with hemophilia who have had joint bleeds before, regular preventive treatment may help protect their joints. It may reduce pain and help them move better. But it requires using more medicine on a regular basis.

**What is still unknown?**
More research is needed to answer these questions:
- When should preventive treatment start?
- How often should medicine be given?
- What dose works best?
- Is the benefit worth the extra cost?

**What do the researchers conclude?**
Regular preventive treatment may be better than waiting to treat bleeds after they happen. But doctors and patients need more information to make the best treatment choices. Future studies should help answer the remaining questions about the best way to give preventive treatment."

What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether probiotics can be used to treat chronic constipation without a physical explanation in children (aged 0 to 18 years). 
We analysed data from 14 studies to answer this question.
Key messages 
We were unable to draw conclusions when comparing probiotics to placebo for frequency of defecation in children treated for chronic constipation without a physical explanation. There may be no difference in treatment success between the two groups. 
There may not be a difference in frequency of defecation or treatment success when comparing probiotics and laxatives to using laxatives alone. 
We were unable to draw conclusions when comparing probiotics to magnesium oxide for frequency of defecation or treatment success. 
There may be a higher frequency of defecation in children treated with synbiotic preparations compared to placebo. 
There may not be a difference in participants withdrawing from the studies due to adverse events when comparing probiotic preparations to placebo. 
We were unable to draw conclusions on the safety of any of the other comparisons due to the low number of people who withdrew from the studies. 
What was studied in the review? 
Children often suffer from constipation for long periods of time, and when there is no underlying physical cause that can be found we call it 'functional constipation'. 
It has been suggested that probiotic and synbiotic preparations might help improve symptoms in these children. Probiotics are preparations that contain living bacteria that have been proposed to be beneficial to the digestive system. Synbiotics also include food substances that support the growth of these bacteria. 
There is currently no consensus about whether this is the case, or how these preparations are best used. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) comparing any probiotic or synbiotic treatment with any other treatment (such as dummy/placebo treatments) in children with chronic constipation without a physical explanation. We found 14 trials including a total of 1127 participants who were aged under 18. We made the following conclusions.• There may be no difference in treatment success when comparing probiotics to placebo.• We were unable to draw conclusions on whether there is a difference in the frequency of defecation.• There may be no difference in treatment success when comparing probiotics and laxatives to laxatives alone.• We were unable to draw conclusions on frequency of defecation or treatment success when comparing probiotics to magnesium oxide.• Synbiotics may be better than placebo in improving the frequency of defection.• There may be no difference in how many people withdrew from the trials because of side effects when comparing probiotics to placebo, or probiotics and laxative to laxative alone.• We have limited confidence in the evidence because the studies only included a small number of children, and due to lack of detail on some of the methods used. 
All analyses were limited due to differences in the specific probiotics or the treatments they were compared with, low numbers of children included in the studies and, most importantly, the use of a range of different measures of success. This meant that combining studies was difficult, so the overall ability of this review to answer its core questions was limited. 
What next? 
Future studies are needed to find out how helpful probiotics are for childhood constipation. Researchers need to agree whether probiotics should be a first option therapy, an add‐on to other therapies, a second option after other therapies have failed, or a combination of all the above. 
Future research should measure the same items (known as a core outcome set) to ensure these results can support future reviews.

","# Plain Language Summary: Probiotics for Long-Term Constipation in Children

## Plain Title
Can Probiotics Help Treat Long-Term Constipation in Children?

## Rationale

**What is constipation and why does it matter?**

Many children have trouble pooping for long periods of time. This is called constipation. When doctors cannot find a physical cause for the constipation, they call it ""functional constipation."" This means the body is not working as it should, but there is no disease or blockage causing the problem.

Constipation can be hard for children and their families. It can cause pain, worry, and affect daily life.

**What are probiotics and why might they help?**

Probiotics are tiny living bacteria that may help the gut work better. You can take them as pills, powders, or drinks. Some people also use synbiotics, which are probiotics plus special food that helps the good bacteria grow.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors are not sure if probiotics really help children with constipation. They also do not know the best way to use them. This review looked at many studies to find answers. The goal was to see if probiotics work better than other treatments or dummy pills (called placebos).

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 14 different studies. These studies included 1,127 children under 18 years old. All the children had long-term constipation with no physical cause.

The studies were randomized controlled trials. This means children were put into groups by chance. Some got probiotics. Others got different treatments like laxatives, magnesium oxide, or dummy pills.

The researchers compared how often children pooped. They also looked at whether treatment worked overall. They checked if children stopped treatment because of side effects.

**Who was in the studies?**

All children were under 18 years old. They all had constipation that lasted a long time. Doctors could not find a physical reason for their constipation.

The time children spent in each study varied. This information was not the same across all studies.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The results were mixed and often unclear:

**Probiotics compared to dummy pills:**
- Treatment success may be about the same.
- The researchers could not tell if probiotics helped children poop more often.
- Side effects seemed similar in both groups.

**Probiotics plus laxatives compared to laxatives alone:**
- There may be no difference in how well treatment worked.
- There may be no difference in how often children pooped.

**Probiotics compared to magnesium oxide:**
- The researchers could not draw clear conclusions.

**Synbiotics compared to dummy pills:**
- Synbiotics may help children poop more often.

**Safety:**
- About the same number of children stopped treatment due to side effects in most comparisons.

**Why were the results unclear?**

The researchers had limited confidence in the findings. Here is why:
- The studies were small.
- Each study used different types of probiotics.
- Each study measured success differently.
- Some studies did not explain their methods clearly.

These problems made it hard to combine results from different studies.

**What does this mean?**

Based on current evidence, we cannot say for sure if probiotics help children with constipation. More research is needed.

**What comes next?**

Future studies need to:
- Include more children.
- Use the same ways to measure success.
- Agree on when to use probiotics (as first treatment, with other treatments, or after other treatments fail).
- Use clear methods and report all details.

This will help doctors know if probiotics truly help children with constipation.

**How current is this information?**

This review includes studies published up to June 2021.

Background 
Degenerative knee disease (osteoarthritis in the knee which affects the joint lining and menisci) is the most common cause of knee pain, swelling and stiffness in the knee joint which leads to difficulty in walking. The cartilage in the knee joint is damaged, resulting in friction in the joint surfaces and formation of new bone in severe cases. Arthroscopic knee surgery removes damaged cartilage and loose tissue and smooths the knee joint surfaces. 
Study characteristics 
We included 16 randomised trials (2105 participants) published up to 16 April 2021. Trials were conducted in Canada, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Norway, Pakistan, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Netherlands and USA. 
Overall, 56% of participants were women. The average age of participants ranged from 46 to 65 years and the average duration of symptoms ranged from 1.6 months to 4.4 years. Of the nine trials reporting their funding source, none received funding from industry. The other seven trials did not report any funding source. 
We limit reporting to the main comparison, arthroscopic surgery versus placebo (dummy or sham) surgery. 
Key results 
Compared with placebo surgery, arthroscopic surgery had little benefit:
Pain (lower scores mean less pain) 
Improvement in pain was 4.6 points better (0.02 better to 9 better) on a 0 to 100 point scale with arthroscopic surgery than with placebo, 3 months after surgery. 
• People who had arthroscopic surgery rated their post‐operative pain as 35.5 points.
• People who had placebo surgery rated their post‐operative pain as 40.1 points.
Knee function (higher scores mean better function) 
Improvement in knee function was 0.1 points better (3.2 worse to 3.4 better) on a 0 to 100 point scale with arthroscopic surgery than with placebo, 3 months after surgery. 
• People who had arthroscopic surgery rated their post‐operative knee function as 76.0 points. 
• People who had placebo surgery rated their post‐operative knee function as 75.9 points. 
Knee‐specific quality of life (higher scores mean better quality of life) 
Improvement in knee‐specific quality of life was 5.6 points better (0.4 better to 10.7 better) on a 0 to 100 point scale with arthroscopic surgery than with placebo, 3 months after surgery. 
• People who had arthroscopic surgery rated their post‐operative quality of life as 75.3 points. 
• People who had placebo surgery rated their post‐operative quality of life as 69.7 points. 
Treatment success (rated by participants) 
8% more people rated their treatment a success (25% fewer to 63% more), or 8 more people out of 100, at up to 5 years after surgery. 
• 82 out of 100 people reported treatment success with arthroscopic surgery.
• 74 out of 100 people reported treatment success with placebo surgery.
Serious adverse events 
2% more people (2% fewer to 10% more) had serious adverse events, or 2 more people out of 100, at up to 5 years after surgery. 
• 8 out of 100 people reported serious adverse events with arthroscopic surgery.
• 6 out of 100 people reported serious adverse events with placebo surgery.
Total adverse events 
2% more people (3% fewer to 11% more), had adverse events, or 2 more people out of 100, at up to 5 years after surgery. 
• 17 out of 100 people reported adverse events with arthroscopic surgery.
• 15 out of 100 people reported adverse events with placebo surgery.
Subsequent knee surgery 
2% more people (0.1% fewer to 9% more), had subsequent knee surgery, or 2 more people out of 100, at up to 5 years. 
• 4 out of 100 people had knee replacement or osteotomy (knee surgery that reshapes bone) with arthroscopic surgery. 
• 2 out of 100 people had knee replacement or osteotomy with placebo surgery.
Certainty of the evidence 
We are confident that knee arthroscopy does not provide any clinically important benefits in terms of pain and function. We are moderately confident that knee arthroscopy probably does not provide any clinically important benefits in knee‐specific quality of life over a placebo procedure. Knee arthroscopy may not increase participant‐reported success compared with placebo. We have little confidence in the evidence because of differences across trials in reporting success and the small number of events. We are less certain of the risk of serious and total adverse events in arthroscopy versus placebo surgery: the evidence was uncertain because of the small number of events and incomplete reporting of study information. 
Adverse events associated with surgery include total knee replacement, osteotomy, repeat arthroscopy, arthroscopy in opposite knee, cutaneous nerve lesion (damage to nerves in the skin), deep or superficial infection, general knee pain, swelling, instability, stiffness or decreased range of motion in the affected or opposite knee, haemarthrosis (bleeding into the knee joint), death, acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), hypoxaemia (decreased oxygen in the blood), deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the deep veins), tendonitis (inflammation of tendons), pain from fall or other trauma, rupture of a Baker's cyst (a fluid‐filled sac behind the knee), and back or hip or foot pain. 
Arthroscopic surgery may or may not lead to slightly more subsequent knee surgery (replacement or osteotomy) than the placebo procedure. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Knee Arthroscopy Surgery for Worn-Out Knee Joints

## Plain Title

Does knee surgery help people with worn-out knee joints feel better?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some people have worn-out knee joints. Doctors call this knee arthritis. The smooth covering inside the knee gets damaged. This causes pain, swelling, and stiffness. Walking becomes hard. The knee does not move well.

**What is the treatment being studied?**

One treatment is knee surgery called arthroscopy. Doctors make small cuts in the knee. They use a tiny camera to look inside. They remove damaged pieces. They smooth rough areas in the joint.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors wanted to know if this surgery really helps. They compared real surgery to fake surgery. In fake surgery, doctors make cuts but do not fix anything inside. This helps show if the surgery itself works. Or if people feel better just because they had surgery.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 16 studies. These studies included 2,105 people total. The studies took place in many countries. These included Canada, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Norway, Pakistan, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Netherlands, and the United States.

**Who was in the studies?**

About half the people were women (56 out of 100). People were between 46 and 65 years old on average. They had knee problems for different amounts of time. Some had problems for less than 2 months. Others had problems for over 4 years.

**What happened in the studies?**

Some people got real knee surgery. Other people got fake surgery. Neither group knew which type they got. Doctors checked how people felt up to 5 years later.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The real surgery did not help much more than fake surgery.

**Pain:**

People rated their pain on a scale from 0 to 100. Zero means no pain. One hundred means worst pain. Three months after surgery:
- People with real surgery had pain of 36 points
- People with fake surgery had pain of 40 points
- The difference was only 5 points

This small difference does not matter much to most people.

**How well the knee works:**

People rated how well their knee worked. The scale went from 0 to 100. Higher numbers mean the knee works better. Three months after surgery:
- People with real surgery scored 76 points
- People with fake surgery scored 76 points
- There was almost no difference

**Quality of life:**

People rated how their knee affected their life. Three months after surgery:
- People with real surgery scored 75 points
- People with fake surgery scored 70 points
- The difference was 6 points

This difference is small.

**Did people think treatment worked?**

Up to 5 years later:
- 82 out of 100 people with real surgery said it worked
- 74 out of 100 people with fake surgery said it worked
- The difference was 8 more people out of 100

**Were there problems from surgery?**

Serious problems happened to:
- 8 out of 100 people with real surgery
- 6 out of 100 people with fake surgery

Any problems happened to:
- 17 out of 100 people with real surgery
- 15 out of 100 people with fake surgery

Problems included infection, more pain, swelling, stiffness, blood clots, heart attack, and nerve damage. Some people needed more surgery later.

**Did people need more surgery later?**

Up to 5 years later:
- 4 out of 100 people with real surgery needed knee replacement
- 2 out of 100 people with fake surgery needed knee replacement

**What do these results mean?**

Knee arthroscopy surgery does not help much for worn-out knees. It works about the same as fake surgery. The small benefits are not worth the risks. People might feel better just from having any surgery. Or they might get better on their own over time.

**How sure are researchers about these findings?**

Researchers are very sure about the pain and function results. They are fairly sure about quality of life results. They are less sure about problems from surgery. This is because not all studies reported problems the same way.

**What should people know?**

If you have a worn-out knee, talk to your doctor. This surgery may not help you feel much better. Other treatments might work better for you."
10.1002-14651858.CD014484-pls.txt,"Low‐dose misoprostol given by mouth for induction of labour
We looked at the evidence from randomised controlled trials to see if low‐dose misoprostol given by mouth is effective in starting labour in women in their third trimester with a live baby. We compared misoprostol with other commonly used methods of inducing labour. 
What is the issue? 
Artificially starting labour, or induction, is common in pregnancy. Reasons include the mother having high blood pressure in pregnancy or the baby being past the due date. Misoprostol is a type of prostaglandin that can be taken in low doses by mouth to induce labour. Prostaglandins are hormone‐like compounds that are made by the body for various functions (including the natural onset of labour). Unlike other prostaglandins such as vaginal dinoprostone, misoprostol does not need to be stored in the refrigerator. Taking a tablet is convenient to mothers and the low‐dose tablet sizes are now available (25 µg).  
Why is this important? 
A good induction method achieves a safe birth for mother and baby. It is effective, results in a relatively low number of caesarean sections, has few side effects, and is highly acceptable to mothers. Some methods of inducing labour may cause more caesarean sections by being ineffective at bringing on labour, other methods may lead to more caesareans as they cause too many contractions (hyperstimulation) that result in the baby becoming distressed (foetal heart rate changes). 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence on 14 February 2021 and identified 61 trials involving 20,026 women for inclusion in this review. Not all trials were high quality. 
Starting with oral misoprostol immediately may have a similar effect on rates of caesarean section (4 trials, 594 women; low‐certainty evidence) to giving no treatment for 12 to 24 hours then starting oxytocin, while the effects of misoprostol on uterine hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes are unclear (3 trials, 495 women; very low‐quality evidence). All women in theses trials had ruptured membranes. 
Oral misoprostol was compared to vaginal dinoprostone in 13 trials (9676 women). Misoprostol use probably decreased the risk of caesarean section (moderate‐certainty evidence). When studies were divided by their initial dose of misoprostol, there was evidence that use of 10 µg to 25 µg may be effective in reducing the risk of a caesarean section (9 trials, 8652 women), while the higher 50 µg dose might not reduce the risk (4 trials, 1024 women). There may be very small or no differences between misoprostol and dinoprostone in rates of vaginal births within 24 hours (10 trials, 8983 women; low‐certainty evidence) but may be fewer cases of hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes with oral misoprostol (11 trials, 9084 women; low‐certainty evidence).  
Oral misoprostol was compared with vaginal misoprostol in 33 trials (6110 women). Oral use may have resulted in fewer vaginal births within 24 hours (16 trials, 3451 women; low‐certainty evidence). Oral use may have caused less hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (25 trials, 4857 women; low‐certainty evidence), especially with a dose of 10 µg to 25 µg. There was no clear difference in the number of caesarean sections overall (32 trials, 5914 women; low‐certainty evidence) but oral use likely resulted in fewer caesareans being performed because of concerns of the baby being in distress (24 trials, 4775 women). 
When oral misoprostol was compared to oxytocin for induction, misoprostol use probably resulted in fewer caesarean sections (6 trials, 737 women). We found no clear difference in vaginal birth within 24 hours (3 trials, 466 women; moderate‐certainty evidence) or hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (3 trials, 331 women; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Oral misoprostol was compared to a balloon catheter inserted in the cervix to mechanically induce labour. The number of vaginal births within 24 hours may have increased with misoprostol (4 trials, 1044 women; low‐certainty evidence). Misoprostol probably reduced the risk of caesarean section (6 trials, 2993 women; moderate‐certainty evidence) with no difference in risk of hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (4 trials, 1044 women; low‐certainty evidence). 
Different doses and timings of giving oral misoprostol were explored in three small trials. The certainty of the findings from these trials was either low or very low so we cannot draw any meaningful conclusions from this data. 
What does this mean? 
Using low‐dose (50 µg or less) oral misoprostol to induce labour likely leads to fewer caesarean sections and so more vaginal births than vaginal dinoprostone, oxytocin, and a transcervical Foley catheter. Rates of hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes were comparable with these methods. Misoprostol taken by mouth causes less hyperstimulation with foetal heart changes compared to when taken vaginally.  
More trials are needed to establish the most effective misoprostol regimen for labour induction, but for now the findings of this review support oral rather than vaginal use, and suggest that commencing oral misoprostol at a dose of 25 µg or less may be safe and effective. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Using Low-Dose Misoprostol Pills to Start Labor

## Plain Title
Does taking low-dose misoprostol pills by mouth safely start labor in pregnant women?

## Rationale

### What is labor induction and why is it needed?
Sometimes doctors need to start labor artificially. This is called induction. Women may need this for several reasons. Some women have high blood pressure during pregnancy. Other babies are past their due date. A good way to start labor should be safe for both mother and baby. It should work well and not cause too many problems.

### What is misoprostol?
Misoprostol is a medicine that can start labor. It is similar to natural substances the body makes called prostaglandins. These help labor begin naturally. Misoprostol comes in small pills that women can swallow. The pills come in low doses of 25 micrograms. Unlike other similar medicines, misoprostol does not need to be kept cold. Taking a pill is easy for mothers.

### Why did researchers do this study?
Researchers wanted to find the best way to start labor. Some methods do not work well. This can lead to cesarean sections (surgery to deliver the baby). Other methods cause too many contractions. This can stress the baby and also lead to surgery. Researchers compared misoprostol pills to other common ways of starting labor. They wanted to see which method was safest and worked best.

## Trial Design

### How did researchers study this?
Researchers looked at 61 different studies. These studies included 20,026 women total. The researchers searched for studies up to February 2021. All women in the studies were in their last three months of pregnancy. All had live babies.

### What did researchers compare?
Researchers compared misoprostol pills to several other methods:
- Waiting 12 to 24 hours, then using oxytocin (another medicine)
- Vaginal dinoprostone (a different medicine placed in the vagina)
- Vaginal misoprostol (the same medicine placed in the vagina)
- Oxytocin given through an IV
- A balloon catheter (a small tube placed in the cervix)

Researchers also looked at different doses of misoprostol. Some women got 10 to 25 micrograms. Others got 50 micrograms.

## Results

### What did researchers find?

**Compared to vaginal dinoprostone:**
Misoprostol pills probably led to fewer cesarean sections. This was especially true with doses of 10 to 25 micrograms. About the same number of women gave birth within 24 hours with both methods. Misoprostol pills may have caused fewer cases of too many contractions that stressed the baby.

**Compared to vaginal misoprostol:**
Taking misoprostol by mouth caused less stress to babies from too many contractions. This was especially true with doses of 10 to 25 micrograms. The number of cesarean sections was about the same. But fewer cesarean sections were done because of baby distress when women took pills by mouth. Fewer women gave birth within 24 hours with pills by mouth.

**Compared to oxytocin:**
Misoprostol pills probably led to fewer cesarean sections. About the same number of women gave birth within 24 hours.

**Compared to a balloon catheter:**
More women gave birth within 24 hours with misoprostol pills. Misoprostol probably led to fewer cesarean sections. Both methods had similar rates of too many contractions.

### What do these results mean?
Low-dose misoprostol pills (50 micrograms or less) likely lead to fewer cesarean sections than other common methods. This means more women can give birth vaginally. Taking misoprostol by mouth causes fewer problems with too many contractions than placing it in the vagina.

### What do researchers conclude?
The findings support using misoprostol pills by mouth rather than in the vagina. Starting with a dose of 25 micrograms or less appears safe and works well. More studies are needed to find the very best dose and timing. But current evidence shows misoprostol pills are a good option for starting labor."
10.1002-14651858.CD014545-pls.txt,"Dental imaging methods for the detection of early tooth decay
Why is it important to improve the detection of dental caries (tooth decay)? Dentists often aim to identify tooth decay that has already advanced to a level which needs a filling. If dentists were able to find tooth decay when it has only affected the outer layer of the tooth (enamel) then it is possible to stop the decay from spreading any further and prevent the need for fillings. It is also important to avoid a false‐positive result, when treatment may be given when caries is absent. 
What is the aim of this review?This Cochrane Review aimed to find out how accurate X‐ray images and other types of dental imaging are for detecting early tooth decay as part of the dental 'check‐up' for children and adults who visit their general dentist. Researchers in Cochrane included 77 studies published between 1986 and 2018 to answer this question. 
What was studied in the review?Three main types of dental imaging were studied in this review: analogue or digital radiographs (X‐rays) and three‐dimensional (3D) imaging (cone beam computed tomography (CBCT)). We studied decay on the occlusal surfaces (biting surfaces of the back teeth), the proximal surfaces (tooth surfaces that are next to each other), and smooth surfaces. 
What are the main results of the review?Researchers in Cochrane included 77 studies with a total of 15,518 tooth sites or surfaces, where typically 63% of tooth sites or surfaces had enamel caries. Some of these studies reported on more than one type of imaging, on both the permanent and primary ('milk') teeth or different tooth surfaces, and this gave us 104 sets of data to use. If these methods were to be used by a dentist for a routine dental examination, out of 1000 tooth sites or surfaces seen:• the use of these methods will indicate that 336 tooth sites or surfaces will have early tooth decay, and of these, 43 (13%) will have no disease (incorrect diagnosis ‐ false positive);• of the 664 tooth sites with a result indicating that early tooth decay is absent, 337 (51%) will have early tooth decay (incorrect diagnosis ‐ false negative).This high proportion of false‐negative results means that early signs of decay will be missed. We found evidence that 3D imaging methods were better than analogue or digital radiographs at identifying early disease but that analogue radiographs were better at identifying disease‐free tooth surfaces. 
Please see oralhealth.cochrane.org/imaging-modalities-inform-detection-and-diagnosis-early-caries. 
How reliable are the results of the studies in this review?We only included studies that assessed healthy teeth or those that were thought to have early tooth decay. This is because teeth with deep tooth decay would be easier to identify. However, there were some problems with how the studies were conducted. This may result in these methods appearing more accurate than they are, increasing the number of correct results. We judged the certainty of the evidence to be low due to how the studies selected their participants and the large number of studies that were carried out in a laboratory setting on extracted teeth, and the variation in the results. 
Who do the results of this review apply to?Studies included in the review were carried out in South America, Europe, Asia, and the US. A large number of studies examined extracted teeth, while clinical studies were completed in dental hospitals or general dental practices. 
What are the implications of this review?Low‐certainty evidence suggests that imaging for the detection or diagnosis of early tooth decay may result in a relatively high proportion of false‐negative results, with the potential for early disease to become more advanced. If left untreated, the opportunity to provide professional or self‐care practices to arrest or reverse early tooth decay will be missed. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?The electronic searches retrieved used studies published up to 31 December 2018. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Dental Imaging Methods for Finding Early Tooth Decay

## Plain Title
How Well Do X-rays and Other Dental Images Find Early Tooth Decay?

## Rationale

**What is tooth decay and why does it matter?**

Tooth decay is damage to your teeth. It starts small and can grow bigger over time. When decay is deep, dentists need to put in a filling. This can be painful and costly.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Right now, dentists often wait to treat decay until it needs a filling. But decay starts in the outer layer of the tooth first. This outer layer is called enamel. If dentists could find decay when it is only in the enamel, they might stop it from getting worse. This could help people avoid fillings.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know how well dental images work to find early tooth decay. They looked at X-rays and other imaging tools. These are used during regular dental check-ups. The goal was to see if these tools could catch decay early, before it needs a filling.

**Why is this important?**

Finding decay early gives dentists a chance to stop it. Patients could use special toothpaste or get other treatments. This might save the tooth without a filling. But it is also important not to treat teeth that are healthy. Treating healthy teeth wastes time and money.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this question?**

Researchers looked at 77 studies done between 1986 and 2018. These studies tested different types of dental images.

**What types of images did they study?**

They looked at three main types:
- Regular X-rays (also called analogue X-rays)
- Digital X-rays (computer-based X-rays)
- 3D images (a special type called CBCT)

**What teeth did they examine?**

They checked different parts of teeth:
- Biting surfaces of back teeth
- Surfaces where teeth touch each other
- Smooth surfaces of teeth

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included both children and adults. They looked at both baby teeth and adult teeth. Many studies used teeth that had been pulled out. Other studies looked at teeth in people's mouths at dental offices.

**How many teeth were studied?**

Researchers looked at 15,518 tooth surfaces in total. About 63 out of every 100 surfaces had early decay.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The results showed that these imaging tools miss a lot of early decay.

**Here is what would happen in a group of 1,000 tooth surfaces:**

Out of 1,000 surfaces checked:
- The imaging would show that 336 surfaces have early decay
- But 43 of these 336 are actually healthy (wrong result)
- The imaging would show that 664 surfaces are healthy
- But 337 of these 664 actually have early decay (wrong result)

**What does this mean?**

This means the imaging tools miss early decay about half the time. When decay is missed, it can get worse. The tooth may end up needing a filling later.

**Did some imaging work better than others?**

Yes. The 3D images were better at finding early decay. Regular X-rays were better at correctly identifying healthy teeth.

**How reliable are these results?**

The researchers rated the evidence as low certainty. This means we cannot be completely sure about the results. Many studies used pulled teeth instead of teeth in people's mouths. This might make the results different from real dental visits. The studies also showed different results from each other.

**What do these results mean for patients?**

These imaging tools may miss early tooth decay fairly often. When early decay is missed, it can grow and get worse. This means patients might lose the chance to stop decay before it needs a filling. Simple treatments like special toothpaste or fluoride might work on early decay. But these treatments only work if the decay is found early.

**What should happen next?**

More research is needed. Studies should test these imaging tools on real patients in dental offices. This would give more reliable results about how well they work in everyday dental care."
10.1002-14651858.CD014615-pls.txt,"Mothers' positions in labour when baby is lying 'back‐to‐back'
What is the issue? 
Malposition is when the back of the baby's head lies towards the mother's back. As a result, labour and birth can be long and difficult, sometimes resulting in an operative birth (where the baby is delivered by caesarean section or with special tools to help the baby through the birth canal) and more perineal trauma (damage to the pelvic floor). The baby may be more likely to go to a neonatal care unit. Also, women may experience stress or disappointment with the birth experience.  
Why is this important? 
The way a pregnant woman is positioned during labour may help rotate a baby so that the back of the baby's head lies towards the front of the mother's abdomen. This improved position may help the mother and baby have a more normal labour and birth. However, it is not yet known which posture, if any, is effective and when is the best time to use it. 
A systematic review of studies of positions (postures) used by women in labour with a baby in a malposition can provide answers on whether the postures improve birth and other health outcomes for mothers and babies. The summary of this review can be used to update clinical practice guidelines. 
A Cochrane Review in 2007 reported that the use of the 'hands and knees' posture in labour was ineffective for malposition, but it did reduce labouring women's backache. Since then, more trials have been conducted, some using other postures; these need evaluating to see if those postures work. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence (published to 13 July 2021) and identified eight studies  in nine different countries involving 1766 women and their babies. Women in the included studies were either first‐time mothers or mothers who had birthed before. All the women's  pregnancies were at least at 36 weeks.  
The trials compared use of 'hands and knees' posture or 'side‐lying' (lateral) postures (lying on the same side as the baby, lying on the opposite side to the baby, and lying semi‐prone) to other postures (free posture, lying on back, leaning back, lying on the same side as the baby).  
For both the hands and knees posture and side‐lying positions during labour, there may be little or no difference in the numbers of operative births, haemorrhage (profuse bleeding of the mother), severe perineal trauma, and women's satisfaction with their labour and delivery, but there was insufficient evidence to be sure. Many of our outcomes of interest were not reported in the included studies. 
Overall, we have little to no confidence in the evidence, mainly because there were too few women and babies in the studies, and some studies used unclear methods. 
What does this mean? 
Overall, it is uncertain whether hands and knees or side‐lying positions in labour improve the health of mother and baby when a baby is in a malposition. However, if women find the use of hands and knees, side‐lying, or other postures in labour comfortable, there is no reason why they should not choose to use them. 
Further research is needed to enable optimal fetal positioning. In particular, further research is needed on variations in the postures, the impact of longer use of these postures during labour, and on long‐term outcomes for women and their babies.

## Plain Title
Do Different Body Positions During Labor Help When a Baby Is Lying Back-to-Back?

## Rationale

### What is the problem?

Sometimes during labor, a baby lies in a position called ""back-to-back."" This means the back of the baby's head faces the mother's back. This position can make labor harder and longer for the mother.

When a baby is back-to-back, several problems can happen. The mother may need help to deliver the baby. This help might be a cesarean section (surgery to deliver the baby). Or doctors might use special tools to help the baby come out. The mother's pelvic floor may get damaged during birth. The baby may need special care after birth. The mother may feel upset or disappointed about how the birth went.

### Why did researchers do this study?

Researchers wanted to know if changing positions during labor could help. They thought that certain body positions might help the baby turn. If the baby turns, the back of the baby's head would face the front of the mother's belly. This better position might make labor easier and safer.

Researchers needed to find out which positions work best. They also wanted to know when to use these positions. An earlier study from 2007 looked at the ""hands and knees"" position. That study found it did not help the baby turn. But it did help reduce back pain during labor. Since then, more studies have tested other positions. Researchers needed to review all these new studies.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?

Researchers looked for all studies about body positions during labor. They searched up to July 13, 2021. They found eight studies from nine different countries. These studies included 1,766 women and their babies.

The women in these studies were having their first baby or had given birth before. All the women were at least 36 weeks pregnant.

The studies tested different positions. Some women used the ""hands and knees"" position. This means getting on all fours. Other women used ""side-lying"" positions. This means lying on their side. Some women lay on the same side as the baby. Others lay on the opposite side. Some lay partly on their stomach.

Researchers compared these positions to other positions. The other positions included lying on the back, leaning back, or choosing any comfortable position.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

The results were unclear. For both hands and knees position and side-lying positions, researchers found the following:

There may be little or no difference in how many women needed help to deliver their babies. There may be little or no difference in heavy bleeding after birth. There may be little or no difference in serious damage to the pelvic floor. There may be little or no difference in how satisfied women felt about their birth experience.

However, the researchers could not be sure about these findings. Many important outcomes were not measured in the studies.

### What does this mean?

The researchers have little confidence in these results. This is because the studies were small. They did not include enough women and babies. Some studies did not use clear methods.

It is uncertain whether hands and knees or side-lying positions help mothers and babies when the baby is back-to-back. But if a woman finds these positions comfortable during labor, she can use them. There is no reason not to use them.

More research is needed. Future studies should test different types of positions. They should see what happens when women use these positions for longer times. They should also look at long-term health outcomes for mothers and babies."
10.1002-14651858.CD014641-pls.txt,"Impact of diagnostic strategies for tuberculosis using lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan test in people living with HIV 
What was the aim of this review? 
Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death in people living with HIV. The disease is particularly difficult to diagnose in people living with HIV, in part because it is often challenging to produce sputum for diagnosis. The lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan test (LF‐LAM) is a World Health Organization (WHO)‐recommended rapid test to assist in the detection of active tuberculosis in people living with HIV. This review is limited to studies that used the Alere Determine TB LAM Ag test (AlereLAM), which is the only LF‐LAM test currently recommended by the WHO; thus LF‐LAM refers only to AlereLAM in this review. Rapid and early tuberculosis diagnosis may allow for prompt treatment and prevent severe illness and death. The aim of this review was to determine whether the use of LF‐LAM testing had an effect on death and other patient‐important outcomes in people living with HIV. 
Key messages 
In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic testing strategy likely reduces deaths and probably results in a slight increase in tuberculosis treatment initiation in people living with HIV.  
In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may reduce deaths and may result in a large increase in tuberculosis treatment initiation in people living with HIV. 
What was studied in the review? 
We searched for trials in adults (15 years and older) that evaluated the effect of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy that included the LF‐LAM test compared to standard care using other WHO‐recommended diagnostic tests in adults living with HIV. 
What were the main results of the review? 
We identified three trials, two in inpatient settings and one in outpatient settings.
Inpatient settings 
In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy likely reduces mortality in people living with HIV at eight weeks compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (2 trials, 5102 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). 
In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy probably results in a slight increase in the proportion of people living with HIV who were started on tuberculosis treatment compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (2 trials, 5102 participants moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Outpatient settings 
In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may reduce mortality in people living with HIV at six months compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (1 trial, 2972 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may result in a large increase in the proportion of people living with HIV who were started on tuberculosis treatment compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (1 trial, 3022 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
Other patient‐important outcomes 
The included studies assessed other patient‐important outcomes in different ways. The studies demonstrated that more people living with HIV were able to produce urine compared to sputum for tuberculosis diagnostic testing, and more people living with HIV were diagnosed with tuberculosis in the group that received LF‐LAM. 
How up‐to‐date is the review? 
We searched for relevant trials up to 12 March 2021.

## Plain Title
Does Using a Urine Test Help Diagnose Tuberculosis and Save Lives in People Living with HIV?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Tuberculosis (TB) is a lung infection. It is the top cause of death in people living with HIV. TB is hard to find in people with HIV. Doctors usually need spit (called sputum) to test for TB. But many people with HIV cannot cough up spit easily. This makes TB hard to diagnose.

**What is the new test?**

There is a quick urine test called LF-LAM. It looks for signs of TB in urine. The World Health Organization says doctors can use this test. It is also called the Alere Determine TB LAM Ag test.

**Why was this study needed?**

Finding TB quickly is important. When doctors find TB early, they can start treatment right away. Early treatment can stop people from getting very sick. It can also save lives. Researchers wanted to know if using the urine test helps save lives. They also wanted to know if it helps more people start TB treatment.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

Researchers looked at three studies. These studies tested adults who were 15 years old or older. All people in the studies were living with HIV.

Two studies looked at people who were sick enough to stay in the hospital. One study looked at people who came to clinics but did not need to stay in the hospital.

The studies compared two groups:
- One group got the urine test plus regular TB tests
- One group got only regular TB tests

**How many people were in the studies?**

More than 11,000 people took part in all three studies combined.

**How long did the studies last?**

The hospital studies checked on people for eight weeks. The clinic study checked on people for six months.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

**For people in the hospital:**

Using the urine test likely saved lives. Fewer people died within eight weeks when doctors used the urine test. This result is fairly certain.

Using the urine test probably helped more people start TB treatment. Slightly more people began treatment when doctors used the urine test. This result is fairly certain.

**For people at clinics:**

Using the urine test may save lives. Fewer people died within six months when doctors used the urine test. Researchers are less certain about this result.

Using the urine test may help many more people start TB treatment. Many more people began treatment when doctors used the urine test. Researchers are less certain about this result.

**Other important findings:**

More people could give a urine sample than a spit sample. This makes sense because urine is easier to provide.

More people were found to have TB when doctors used the urine test. This means the test helped find TB cases that might have been missed.

**What do these results mean?**

The urine test helps doctors find TB in people living with HIV. It works well for people in hospitals and for people at clinics. Finding TB faster means people can start treatment sooner. Starting treatment sooner can save lives.

The test is especially helpful because giving urine is easier than coughing up spit. This means more people can get tested.

**Conclusion:**

Using the LF-LAM urine test as part of TB testing helps people living with HIV. It likely reduces deaths in hospitals. It may reduce deaths in clinics. It helps more people start TB treatment in both settings. Doctors should consider using this test to help find TB in people living with HIV.

10.1002-14651858.CD014653-pls.txt,"Exercise training for adults receiving dialysis treatments
What is the issue? 
People undergoing dialysis treatments are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease and depression, have a lower quality of life and limited survival than the general population. Furthermore, many people undergoing dialysis have difficulty performing daily activities because they lack the physical capacity and strength to do so. Multiple trials have assessed the potential for exercise training to improve the condition of adults undergoing dialysis, but no consensus has been reached. 
What did we do? 
We searched the medical literature for all randomised trials that assessed structured exercise programs in people undergoing dialysis. We then assessed the quality of those studies and combined their results to draw conclusions regarding the effect of exercise training to improve aspects of physical and mental health that are important to patients undergoing dialysis. 
What did we find? 
We found 89 studies involving 4291 participants. The exercise training programs lasted from eight weeks to two years and most often took place three times a week during the dialysis treatment. We could not determine the impact of exercise training on death, cardiovascular events (such as a heart attack) or mental well‐being. Moderate certainty evidence suggested that exercise training of any type is likely to improve depressive symptoms in adults undergoing dialysis, particularly when the exercise was maintained for longer than four months. Moderate quality evidence also suggested that exercise training may improve people's capacity to perform activities and tasks through the improvement of their capacity to walk and the strength and endurance of their legs. Exercise training may also improve fatigue and the physical aspects of quality of life, but the quality of the evidence was low. We could not conclude on the effect of exercise training on a person's mental well‐being. 
ConclusionsExercise training for people undergoing maintenance dialysis is likely to improve depression and their capacity to perform activities and tasks. Exercise training may also improve fatigue and pain sightly. Exercise training may improve the physical aspects of quality of life, but it is unclear whether it improves a person's mental well‐being. It is unclear whether exercise training reduces the number of deaths or cardiovascular events. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Exercise Training for Adults on Dialysis

## Plain Title
Can Exercise Help People Who Are on Dialysis?

## Rationale

**What is dialysis and why do people need it?**

Some people have kidneys that do not work well. These people need dialysis. Dialysis is a treatment that cleans the blood when kidneys cannot do this job.

**What problems do people on dialysis face?**

People on dialysis often have many health problems. They have a higher risk of heart disease. They often feel sad or depressed. Their quality of life is lower than other people. They may not live as long as people who do not need dialysis.

Many people on dialysis cannot do daily tasks easily. They may feel too weak or tired. They may lack the strength to do simple activities.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Many studies have looked at whether exercise can help people on dialysis. But doctors did not agree on whether exercise really works. Researchers wanted to find a clear answer. They wanted to know if exercise could help people on dialysis feel better and do more.

**Why might exercise help?**

Exercise can make people stronger. It can help the heart work better. It can improve mood. Researchers thought exercise might help people on dialysis in these same ways.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this question?**

Researchers looked for all studies about exercise and dialysis. They found 89 studies. These studies included 4,291 people.

**Who was in these studies?**

All the people in the studies were adults on dialysis.

**What did the exercise programs look like?**

The exercise programs were different in each study. Some programs lasted 8 weeks. Others lasted up to 2 years. Most programs had people exercise 3 times each week. Most people exercised during their dialysis treatment.

**What did researchers measure?**

Researchers looked at many things. They checked if people died. They checked for heart attacks. They measured how far people could walk. They measured leg strength. They asked people about their mood and quality of life. They asked about feeling tired or having pain.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found some clear benefits from exercise.

**Depression got better.** Exercise likely helps reduce feelings of sadness and depression. This was especially true when people exercised for more than 4 months.

**People could do more activities.** Exercise likely helps people do daily tasks better. People could walk farther. Their legs became stronger. Their legs had more endurance.

**Fatigue may improve.** Exercise may help people feel less tired. The evidence for this was not as strong.

**Physical quality of life may improve.** Exercise may help the physical parts of life feel better. This means people may feel better about what their body can do. But the evidence for this was not very strong.

**Pain may improve slightly.** Exercise may reduce pain a little bit.

**What was unclear?**

Some things were not clear from the studies. Researchers could not tell if exercise prevents death. They could not tell if it prevents heart attacks. They could not tell if exercise improves mental well-being or how people feel emotionally about their life.

**What do these results mean?**

Exercise training is likely helpful for people on dialysis. It can help with depression. It can help people do more activities. It may also help with tiredness and pain.

**Why is this study important?**

This study combined results from many smaller studies. It gives doctors and patients better information. People on dialysis can now know that exercise will likely help them feel less depressed and do more activities. This can help them decide if they want to add exercise to their treatment plan.

More research is still needed. Future studies should look at whether exercise helps people live longer. They should also look more closely at mental well-being."
10.1002-14651858.CD014698-pls.txt,"Routine ultrasound scans for babies before 24 weeks of pregnancy.
We set out to determine the effect of routine ultrasound scans early in pregnancy (before 24 weeks). This was in comparison to no scan at all, or scans only when a clinical problem was suspected, such as if the woman has vaginal bleeding, or the baby is at high risk of having an abnormality. 
What is the issue? 
Ultrasound scans send out high‐frequency sound waves directed to the area being examined, and use the reflected sound to make an image. This review considers two types of scan in the first half of pregnancy.  Early scans (before 14 weeks) mainly aim to count the number of babies, to check they are growing in the correct place and check the pregnancy dates.  Later scans, typically done around 18 to 24 weeks, recheck all the above, and also examine the baby's anatomy and whether the placenta (afterbirth) is in the correct place. Both types of scan may cause parental anxiety and a false positive diagnoses could lead to harm. The aim of this review is to compare routine with selective or no scans. 
Why is this important? 
It has been assumed that routine scans before 24 weeks' gestation will result in the earlier detection of problems and improve management and the pregnancy outcome. The alternative is selective scans for specific reasons. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials. We found 13 studies including 85,265 women. We included two main comparisons. 
Routine early scanning  
Ultrasound scans in the first 14 weeks reduced short‐term maternal worries about the pregnancy. There was no evidence of a clear effect on induction of labour to prevent the pregnancy going overdue, loss of the baby, early birth (before 34 weeks) or mothers choosing termination for baby abnormalities. 
Routine later scanning  
Second trimester scans, at 14 to 24 weeks, increased detection of baby abnormalities, and more women chose termination of pregnancy for this reason. There was no evidence of an effect on perinatal loss. Induction of labour to prevent the pregnancy going overdue was reduced. No studies reported how it affected maternal anxiety. Multiple pregnancies were more likely to be detected by 24 weeks. Long‐term follow‐up of children exposed to these scans did not indicate that they were harmful to children's physical or intellectual development. 
We also found one trial from a group of low and middle income countries, comparing a combination of two scans and specialist training of health professionals and referral of women with complications, with selective scans and routine care. The intervention did not alter the number of women delivering in a hospital with caesarean section facility. Nor did it appear to reduce maternal deaths or the numbers of low‐birthweight babies, although the evidence was very uncertain. 
We also found one trial where all women underwent scans but the results were revealed to the health care professionals in half the cases. This trial showed no important effect of revealing the scan results but the evidence was very uncertain. 
Most studies were carried out relatively early in the development of scan technology and when training in its use was less advanced. In most trials a large proportion of women in the control groups received a scan too. 
What does this mean? 
Early scans probably reduce maternal worries about the baby in the short term. Later scans may reduce labour induction to prevent the pregnancy going overdue. They may also improve detection of major abnormalities in the baby and increase the number of women who choose pregnancy termination for this reason. They may also reduce the number of undetected twin pregnancies. All these findings accord with common sense.  
Although neither type of scan appears to alter other important outcomes, our review may underestimate the effect in modern practice because the trials were mostly from relatively early in the development of scan technology, and many participants in the control arms also had scans.  
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Do Routine Ultrasound Scans Before 24 Weeks of Pregnancy Help Mothers and Babies?

## Rationale

**What is an ultrasound scan?**
An ultrasound scan uses sound waves to create pictures of a baby inside the mother's womb. The sound waves bounce off the baby and create an image on a screen.

**Why do doctors use ultrasound scans?**
Doctors use two types of scans in early pregnancy. Early scans happen before 14 weeks. These scans check how many babies there are, make sure the baby is growing in the right place, and check the due date. Later scans happen around 18 to 24 weeks. These scans check the baby's body parts and make sure the placenta is in the right place.

**What is the problem?**
Some doctors give all pregnant women ultrasound scans. Other doctors only give scans when there is a problem, like bleeding. Scans can make parents worry. Sometimes scans show a problem that is not really there. This can cause harm.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors thought routine scans would find problems early. They hoped this would help mothers and babies stay healthy. But no one knew for sure if giving all women scans was better than only giving scans when needed.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at 13 studies. These studies included 85,265 pregnant women. The researchers compared women who got routine scans with women who got no scans or only scans when there was a problem.

**Who was in the studies?**
The studies included pregnant women. Some got early scans before 14 weeks. Others got later scans between 14 and 24 weeks.

**How long did the studies last?**
The studies followed women through their pregnancies. Some studies also checked on the children after they were born.

## Results

**What did the researchers find about early scans?**
Early scans before 14 weeks helped reduce worry in mothers. The scans did not change other important outcomes. They did not affect how many women needed labor to be started early. They did not change how many babies were lost. They did not change how many babies were born too early (before 34 weeks). They did not change how many women chose to end their pregnancy because of baby problems.

**What did the researchers find about later scans?**
Later scans between 14 and 24 weeks found more problems with babies. More women chose to end their pregnancy when serious problems were found. The scans helped find more twin pregnancies. The scans reduced the need to start labor to prevent overdue pregnancy. The scans did not change how many babies were lost. The studies did not check if these scans reduced worry in mothers.

**Did scans harm children?**
Researchers followed some children for many years. The scans did not harm how children grew or learned.

**What about other types of studies?**
One study from poorer countries tried giving two scans plus special training for health workers. This did not change where women gave birth. It did not reduce deaths of mothers. It did not reduce the number of small babies.

**What are the main conclusions?**
Early scans probably help reduce worry in mothers for a short time. Later scans may help find serious problems with babies. They may help find twin pregnancies. They may reduce the need to start labor early. These findings make sense.

**Important notes about these results:**
Most studies were done many years ago. Ultrasound machines are better now. Doctors are better trained now. Many women in the studies who were not supposed to get scans got them anyway. This makes it hard to know the true effect of routine scans. The real benefits of scans today might be greater than what these studies showed."
10.1002-14651858.CD014877.pub2-abstract.txt,"Rapid molecular tests for tuberculosis and tuberculosis drug resistance: the views and experiences of people who are tested and healthcare providers 
What is the aim of this review? 
We aimed to understand the experiences and opinions of people using rapid automated tests that identify tuberculosis and resistance to tuberculosis drugs (molecular diagnostic tests). Users include people who might have tuberculosis and their families or caregivers, doctors, nurses, laboratory staff, and managers of services or programmes. 
What was studied in this review?  
Rapid molecular diagnostic tests were designed to make diagnosis easier and faster for people with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis, because they do not require a well‐equipped laboratory, but can be done in clinics closer to where people live. Since these tests can also suggest whether an individual suffers from drug‐resistant tuberculosis (including multidrug‐resistant tuberculosis (MDR‐TB)), the right treatment can be started earlier. We collected and analysed all relevant studies and found 32 studies conducted in areas where tuberculosis is common in low‐ and middle‐income countries. 
MDR‐TB is tuberculosis caused by resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid, the two most effective first‐line drugs used to treat tuberculosis.  
This qualitative evidence synthesis links to another Cochrane Review that examines the diagnostic accuracy of a rapid molecular test for tuberculosis drug resistance. Yet, diagnostic tests only have an impact on health if they are put to use in a correct and timely manner. Accuracy studies do not reveal what users think of or how they experience the test in question. We need to understand the perspectives and experiences of all users. Otherwise, we risk these tests not fitting settings where they are to be used or not being accessible for those in need. 
What are the main findings? 
People with tuberculosis value knowing what is wrong with them. People valued having an accurate diagnosis, avoiding delays in being diagnosed, having accessible testing facilities, and keeping cost low. Similarly, healthcare providers value having accurate tests that give them confidence in the diagnosis, rapid results, and keeping cost low, being able to use different specimens (such as sputum and stool)  and receiving information about drug resistance as part of the test results. Laboratory personnel appreciated that laboratory work was made easier and that staff was more satisfied thanks to rapid molecular diagnostic tests. 
Our review also identified several challenges to realizing these values. Some people with tuberculosis and some healthcare providers were reluctant to use rapid molecular diagnostic tests because of fears of testing positive, concerns of stigma or discredit in the community, or expenses related to the testing. Additional support is required to overcome these barriers that are common to other approaches to testing for tuberculosis. Other challenges that led to delays and underuse of rapid molecular diagnostic tests were health system inefficiencies; poor quality of specimens; difficulty in transporting specimens; lack of sufficient resources such as staff or equipment; increased workload for providers; inefficiencies in integrating the test into routines at clinics; the complicated or lengthy steps involved in obtaining a tuberculosis diagnosis; clinicians relying too much on the test result while neglecting their own experience with diagnosing tuberculosis; and processes of implementing the test in national programmes that lacked data about real‐life situations and did not include all relevant stakeholders such as local decision‐makers, providers or people seeking a diagnosis. 
Lastly, people expressed concerns about unsustainable funding, maintenance requirements of the tests, lengthy delays in diagnosis, underuse of rapid molecular diagnostic tests, lack of tuberculosis diagnostic facilities in local communities, conflicts of interest between donors and people who utilize the tests, and too many restrictions on who was allowed to access the test. These concerns hampered access to prompt and accurate testing and treatment. This was particularly the case for vulnerable people, such as children, people with MDR‐TB, or those with limited ability to pay. 
Overall, these challenges risk undoing the added value of rapid molecular diagnostic tests. They risk leading to less frequent use of these tests. Implementation of new diagnostic tests, like those considered in this review, will need to tackle the challenges identified in this review including weak infrastructure and systems, as well as insufficient data about real‐life situations before and during implementation in order to ensure the tests are accessible for those in need. 
How up to date is this review? 
We included studies published between 1 January 2007 and 20 October 2021. We limited all searches to 2007 onward because the development of Xpert MTB/RIF, the first rapid molecular diagnostic test in this review, was completed in 2009. 
","# Plain Language Summary: What People Think About Fast Tests for Tuberculosis

## Plain Title
What Patients and Healthcare Workers Think About Fast Tests That Find Tuberculosis and Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis

## Rationale

**What is tuberculosis and why does it matter?**

Tuberculosis is a serious lung disease. It spreads from person to person. It can make people very sick. Some people die from it.

**What is the problem?**

Old tests for tuberculosis take a long time. They need special labs. These labs are often far from where people live. This means people wait a long time to know if they have tuberculosis. They cannot start treatment right away.

Some tuberculosis does not respond to regular drugs. This is called drug-resistant tuberculosis. Finding out about drug resistance takes even more time with old tests.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know what people think about new fast tests. These tests can find tuberculosis quickly. They can also show if the tuberculosis is drug-resistant. The tests work in clinics close to where people live.

**Why was this study needed?**

A test only helps if people use it. Researchers needed to understand what patients and healthcare workers think. They wanted to know what problems people face when using these tests. This helps make sure the tests work well in real life.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a regular medical trial. Researchers looked at 32 other studies. These studies asked people about their experiences with fast tuberculosis tests.

**Who was included?**

The studies included many types of people:
- People who might have tuberculosis
- Family members and caregivers
- Doctors and nurses
- Lab workers
- Program managers

**Where did the studies take place?**

All studies happened in countries where tuberculosis is common. These were low-income and middle-income countries.

**What time period did researchers look at?**

Researchers looked at studies from 2007 to 2021. They started at 2007 because the first fast test was made in 2009.

## Results

**What did people like about the fast tests?**

Patients valued several things:
- Getting the right answer about their health
- Not waiting a long time for results
- Having test sites close to home
- Tests that do not cost too much

Healthcare workers also liked these tests:
- They trusted the test results
- Results came back quickly
- Tests cost less money
- They could test different samples like spit or stool
- Tests showed if tuberculosis was drug-resistant

Lab workers found their jobs easier. They felt happier at work.

**What problems did people face?**

Many challenges made the tests hard to use:

Some people feared getting tested. They worried about:
- Testing positive for tuberculosis
- Other people treating them badly
- The cost of testing

Health system problems caused delays:
- Not enough staff or equipment
- Poor quality samples
- Hard to move samples to labs
- Too much work for healthcare workers
- Tests not fitting into clinic routines
- Too many steps to get a diagnosis

Some doctors relied too much on test results. They stopped using their own knowledge about tuberculosis.

When programs started using these tests, they had problems:
- Not enough information about real-life use
- Did not ask local workers and patients what they needed

Other concerns included:
- Not enough money to keep tests running
- Tests breaking down
- Still long waits for results
- Tests not used enough
- No test sites in local areas
- Rules about who could get tested were too strict

**Who was hurt most by these problems?**

Some groups had the hardest time:
- Children
- People with drug-resistant tuberculosis
- People with little money

**What do these results mean?**

Fast tests can help people with tuberculosis. But many problems stop the tests from working well. These problems include:
- Weak health systems
- Not enough staff and equipment
- Not learning from real-life experiences

**What needs to happen?**

Programs must fix these problems. They need to:
- Strengthen health systems

10.1002-14651858.CD014936.pub2-pls.txt,"Does stopping smoking make people with heart disease less likely to have another heart attack? 
Key messages 
• People with heart disease who stop smoking are likely to experience a decreased risk in future heart attacks or other events linked to the heart or blood vessels, such as stroke.  
• People with heart disease who stop smoking are unlikely to have worse quality of life. 
Smoking and heart disease 
Smoking increases the chances that a person will have a heart attack, however there is less information on whether stopping smoking can reduce the risk of having a second heart attack.  
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out whether stopping smoking after a heart attack can reduce the chances of having further heart attacks or other types of disease linked to the heart or blood vessels. If stopping smoking does prevent further illness this could motivate more people to quit smoking and encourage doctors and nurses to provide more active support to help people to stop.  
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that lasted at least 6 months, and that included people diagnosed with heart disease who were smoking when the study started. Studies also had to measure whether people did or did not stop smoking and whether or not they had another event linked to their heart or blood vessels, such as another heart attack or a stroke.  
Search date: we included studies published up to 15 April 2021. 
What we found 
We found 68 studies with 80,702 people. Most studies included adult men and women from the general population, however, 11 studies included only men. We looked at the combined results of 60 studies that measured events linked to heart disease and of 8 studies that measured people’s quality of life over a period of 6 months or more.  
What are the results of our review? 
Compared with people who continued to smoke, people who stopped smoking were a third less likely to die from heart disease or stroke (evidence from 17,982 people in 18 studies) and a third less likely to have another heart attack or stroke (evidence from 20,290 people in 15 studies). Our confidence in these results was moderate (death from heart disease or stroke) and low (death from heart disease or stroke, another heart attack or another stroke) respectively. Our confidence in the strength of our results was reduced because of issues with how some of the studies were designed and carried out. However, when we only examined studies of a higher standard, we continued to find that people who stopped smoking were less likely to die from heart disease or stroke. This suggests that while we may be uncertain about how big the reduction in the chance of dying is, people who stop smoking are likely to reduce their chances of dying from heart disease or stroke to some degree. We found similar results for a decreased likelihood of dying from any cause, having another heart attack that does not lead to death and having a stroke that does not lead to death.  
We also found that people who stopped smoking had a suggested improvement in quality of life compared with those who continued smoking after being diagnosed with heart disease.

## Plain Title
Does Quitting Smoking Help People with Heart Disease Avoid Another Heart Attack?

## Rationale

**What is heart disease and why does it matter?**

Heart disease affects the heart and blood vessels. It can cause heart attacks and strokes. These events can be deadly or cause lasting harm to the body.

**Why is smoking a problem?**

Smoking makes heart attacks more likely to happen. Many people know this. But doctors needed to learn more about what happens after someone already has heart disease. Does quitting smoking help prevent a second heart attack?

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted clear answers. If quitting smoking helps people with heart disease stay healthier, this information could save lives. It could help more people decide to quit. It could also help doctors and nurses give better support to patients who want to stop smoking.

**What did researchers think would happen?**

They believed that people with heart disease who quit smoking would have fewer heart attacks and strokes. They also thought these people might live longer and feel better.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not one single study. Researchers looked at many studies done by other scientists. They searched for studies that followed people for at least 6 months.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included 80,702 people total. All of them had heart disease. All of them smoked when the studies started. Most studies included both men and women. Some studies included only men.

**What did researchers measure?**

They tracked whether people quit smoking or kept smoking. They also tracked what happened to their health. Did they have another heart attack? Did they have a stroke? Did they die? Researchers also looked at quality of life. This means how well people felt in their daily lives.

**How long did the studies last?**

All studies followed people for at least 6 months. Some studies lasted much longer.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The results showed clear benefits from quitting smoking.

People who quit smoking were much less likely to die from heart disease or stroke. They were about one-third less likely to die compared to people who kept smoking. This information came from 18 studies with 17,982 people.

People who quit were also less likely to have another heart attack or stroke. Again, they were about one-third less likely compared to people who kept smoking. This information came from 15 studies with 20,290 people.

People who quit smoking also lived longer overall. They were less likely to die from any cause.

**What about quality of life?**

People who quit smoking felt better in their daily lives. Their quality of life improved compared to people who kept smoking.

**How strong is this evidence?**

Researchers felt moderately confident about the death results. They felt less confident about the heart attack and stroke results. Why? Some studies had problems with how they were done. But even when researchers looked only at the best studies, the results stayed the same. People who quit smoking still did better.

**What does this mean?**

The exact numbers might not be perfect. But the main message is clear. Quitting smoking helps people with heart disease. It reduces their chances of dying. It reduces their chances of having another heart attack or stroke. It helps them feel better.

**Why does this matter?**

This study gives people with heart disease a strong reason to quit smoking. It also shows doctors and nurses that helping patients quit smoking really works. Quitting smoking can save lives and improve health for people with heart disease."

Key messagesWe did not find enough evidence to show that virtual reality (VR) training improves cataract surgery performance among ophthalmology trainees compared to wet lab or conventional training. 
What is virtual reality training?VR training uses computer technology to simulate a three‐dimensional interactive environment. 
How does cataract surgery training work in ophthalmology trainees?Most postgraduate ophthalmology trainees in the United States (US) transition gradually from performing specific cataract surgery (replacing the cloudy lens inside the eye with an artificial one) steps in a wet laboratory (practicing on cadaver or artificial tissues) or using VR simulators to performing cataract surgery in the operating room. 
Why is this question important?VR training is becoming increasingly common in postgraduate ophthalmology training, but comprehensive reviews of the impact of VR training on trainees’ cataract surgery performance are lacking. 
What did we want to find out?The primary aim of this review was to determine whether VR training improved operating room performance (measured by operating time in the operating room, intraoperative [during the operation] complications, or postoperative [after the operation] complications) in cataract surgery for postgraduate ophthalmology trainees. The secondary aim was to identify the impact of VR training on operating time in simulated settings, supervising physician ratings in the operating room or simulator settings, or VR simulation task ratings. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?We searched for studies that compared VR training to other training methods such as traditional wet laboratory training or no supplementary training in a postgraduate ophthalmology trainee population. 
What did we find?VR relative to conventional or wet laboratory training did not impact operating times, the rate of intraoperative complications, or supervising physician ratings in the operating room. However, compared to trainees without supplementary training, VR‐trained trainees received higher supervising physician ratings in the operating room. The quality of evidence for all outcomes was very low. 
What does this mean?VR training is a promising intervention for teaching cataract surgery, but more rigorous, evidence‐based studies are needed to gauge its impact on key outcomes such as intraoperative and postoperative complications.  
How up‐to‐date is the evidence?The evidence is current up to 14 June 2021.

## Plain Title
Can Computer-Based Training Help Eye Doctors Learn Cataract Surgery?

## Rationale

**What is a cataract and why does it matter?**

A cataract is when the lens inside the eye becomes cloudy. This cloudiness can make it hard for people to see clearly. Cataract surgery fixes this problem by removing the cloudy lens and putting in a new, clear artificial lens.

**Why is training important?**

Eye doctors who are still learning need to practice cataract surgery before they work on real patients. They need safe ways to learn the skills required for this surgery.

**What training methods exist?**

Most eye doctors in training practice in two main ways. First, they use a wet lab. This means they practice on tissues from donors or fake materials. Second, they practice in the operating room with a teacher watching them.

**What is virtual reality training?**

Virtual reality (VR) training uses computers to create a pretend world. Trainees can practice surgery steps in this computer world. It feels like they are doing real surgery, but no real patients are involved.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

More and more training programs use VR. But researchers wanted to know if VR training really helps. Does it make trainees better at surgery? Does it help patients have better results? These questions needed answers.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this question?**

Researchers looked for studies that compared different training methods. They wanted to find studies about eye doctors who were still in training. These studies needed to compare VR training to other methods like wet lab training or no extra training at all.

**Who was included?**

The studies looked at eye doctors in training programs after medical school. These trainees were learning how to do cataract surgery.

**What did researchers measure?**

Researchers wanted to know several things. How long did surgery take? Did problems happen during surgery? Did problems happen after surgery? What did the teaching doctors think about the trainees' skills?

They looked at these measures both in real operating rooms and in practice settings.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found some studies to review. But the quality of these studies was very low. This means we cannot be very sure about the results.

**Comparing VR to wet lab or regular training:**

When trainees used VR instead of wet lab training, it did not change how long surgery took. It did not change how many problems happened during surgery. It also did not change what teaching doctors thought about their skills in the operating room.

**Comparing VR to no extra training:**

When trainees used VR compared to trainees who had no extra training, teaching doctors gave them higher ratings. This means VR training might help some.

**What does this mean for patients and doctors?**

VR training shows promise as a way to teach cataract surgery. But we need better studies to know if it really works. We especially need to know if VR training leads to fewer problems during and after surgery.

**What is the main conclusion?**

Right now, there is not enough good evidence to say that VR training is better than other training methods. More careful research is needed. Future studies should look closely at whether VR training helps patients have safer surgeries with fewer problems.

**How current is this information?**

Researchers looked at all studies published up to June 14, 2021.

**What happens next?**

More high-quality studies are needed. These studies should carefully track what happens to patients. They should measure important things like surgery problems and patient safety. Only then will we know if VR training truly helps eye doctors learn cataract surgery better."
10.1002-14651858.CD014955-pls.txt,"Can day care programs for children under 6 years of age in low‐ to middle‐income countries reduce their risk of drowning? 
Key message 
A day care program with extra features such as community‐based education, parent education, and playpens provided to parents outside the day care facility probably reduces the risk of death by drowning for children under 6 years living in areas where large numbers of children drown each year. 
Why did we do this Cochrane Review? 
Children living in rural areas near open water are at risk of drowning, particularly if they are not attending school or are left unsupervised. Child supervision is recommended to prevent drowning accidents, and organized day care at a center outside the home could help. 
We wanted to know if a day care program for children under 6 years of age in low‐ to middle‐income countries might help to reduce the number of drowning accidents (fatal and non‐fatal). 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at the effects of a day care program on drowning accidents in children under 6 years of age. The day care program could include features such as educational activities aimed at preventing injuries or drowning and early childhood development activities. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We included evidence published up to August 18, 2020.
What did we find? 
We found 2 studies that involved 252,631 children and took place in rural Bangladesh.
One study lasted 4 years and 8 months. It assessed the effects of a day care program that combined parent education, playpens provided to parents, and community education as compared to the effects of no day care program. 
The other study lasted 3 years and 4 months. The effects of a day care program alone and the effects of a combined program of day care with playpens provided to parents were each compared with the effects of only playpens provided to parents. 
What are the main results of our review? 
Compared with no day care program, a day care program for children under 6 years of age, combined with parent education, playpens for parents, and community education, probably reduces the risk of death from drowning (evidence from 1 study in 136,577 children). For every 100,000 children under 6 years of age who were not in the day care program, 77 children might die from drowning, compared with 14 children included in the day care program. 
Providing this day care program with additional activities was cheaper than the cost of every year lost to illness, disability, or early death by drowning (evidence from 1 study in 136,577 children). 
We are uncertain about the effects of a day care program when compared with playpens provided to parents, and we are uncertain about the effects of a day care program combined with playpens for parents when compared with playpens alone. 
Neither study reported results on non‐fatal drowning accidents, unsafe water exposure, the safety of the program, or other accidental injuries. 
Limitations of the evidence 
The results were from two observational studies in which researchers observed the effects of a factor (such as a day care program) without trying to change who did, or did not, experience it. Evidence from observational studies is not as reliable as evidence from randomized controlled studies, in which the programs people receive are decided at random. 
We are moderately confident about the effects of a day care program (with extra features) on the risk of death by drowning in children under 6 years of age. Further research is likely to increase our confidence in these results.

## Plain Title
Can Day Care Centers Help Prevent Young Children from Drowning in Low- and Middle-Income Countries?

## Rationale

**What is the problem?**

Young children who live in rural areas near open water face a high risk of drowning. This is especially true when children are not in school or when no adult is watching them. Drowning is a major cause of death for young children in these areas.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Researchers wanted to find out if day care centers could help keep young children safe from drowning. When children attend day care, adults watch them during the day. This means children are less likely to wander near dangerous water alone.

**What did researchers think would happen?**

Researchers believed that day care programs might reduce drowning deaths. They thought this would work because children would be supervised at the day care center instead of being left alone near water. Some day care programs also taught parents and communities about water safety. Some programs gave parents playpens to keep children safe at home.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at two studies from rural Bangladesh. Both studies watched what happened to children over several years. They did not assign children randomly to groups. Instead, they observed children who did and did not attend day care programs.

**Who was in the study?**

The studies included 252,631 children under 6 years old. All children lived in rural areas of Bangladesh where many children drown each year.

**How long did the studies last?**

One study lasted 4 years and 8 months. The other study lasted 3 years and 4 months.

**What did researchers compare?**

One study compared a day care program (with parent education, playpens, and community education) to no day care program.

The other study compared day care alone and day care with playpens to just giving parents playpens.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The main finding showed that day care programs with extra features probably help prevent drowning deaths. These extra features included teaching parents about safety, giving parents playpens, and educating the whole community.

**How many children were saved?**

Without the day care program, about 77 out of every 100,000 children under 6 years old died from drowning. With the day care program and extra features, only about 14 out of every 100,000 children died from drowning. This means the program probably saved many lives.

**Was the program worth the cost?**

Yes. The day care program cost less money than the value of the years of life saved. This means the program was a good investment.

**What was unclear?**

Researchers were not sure if day care alone (without extra features) helped prevent drowning. They were also not sure if day care with playpens worked better than just giving parents playpens.

The studies did not report on near-drowning accidents, unsafe water exposure, program safety, or other types of accidents.

**What do these results mean?**

Day care programs that include parent education, playpens, and community education probably reduce drowning deaths in young children. This is important for areas where many children drown each year.

**How strong is this evidence?**

The evidence is moderately strong. The results came from studies that observed what happened rather than studies that randomly assigned children to groups. Random assignment usually gives stronger evidence. More research would make us more confident in these findings.

**What should happen next?**

These findings suggest that day care programs with safety education could save children's lives in areas where drowning is common. More research could help us understand which parts of the program work best."
10.1002-14651858.CD014962-pls.txt,"Remdesivir to treat people with COVID‐19
Is remdesivir (an antiviral medicine) an effective treatment for COVID‐19? 
Key messages 
• For adults hospitalised with COVID‐19, remdesivir probably has little or no effect on deaths from any cause up to 28 days after treatment compared with placebo (sham treatment) or usual care.  
• We are uncertain whether remdesivir improves or worsens patients’ condition, based on whether they needed more or less help with breathing. 
• Researchers should agree on key outcomes to be used in COVID‐19 research, and future studies should investigate these areas. This would allow future updates of this review to draw more certain conclusions about the use of remdesivir to treat COVID‐19. 
What is remdesivir? 
Remdesivir is a medicine that fights viruses. It has been shown to prevent the virus that causes COVID‐19 (SARS‐CoV‐2) from reproducing. Medical regulators have approved remdesivir for emergency use to treat people with COVID‐19.  
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know if remdesivir is an effective treatment for people in hospital with COVID‐19 and if it causes unwanted effects compared to placebo or usual care. 
People with COVID‐19 are given different kinds of breathing support, depending on how severe their breathing difficulties are. We used the types of breathing support people received as a measure of the success of remdesivir in treating COVID‐19. Types of breathing support included: 
• for severe breathing difficulties: invasive mechanical ventilation, when a breathing tube is put into patients’ lungs, and a machine (ventilator) breathes for them. Patients are given medicine to make them sedated whilst they are on a ventilator. 
• for moderate to severe breathing difficulties: non‐invasive mechanical ventilation through a mask over the nose and/or mouth, or a helmet. Air or oxygen is pushed through the mask. Patients are generally awake for this treatment. 
• for moderate breathing difficulties: oxygen via a mask or prongs that sit in the nostrils. Patients can still breathe room air. 
We were interested in the following outcomes:
• deaths from any cause in the 28 days after treatment;
• whether patients got better after treatment, measured by how long they spent on mechanical ventilation or oxygen; 
• whether patients’ condition worsened so that they needed oxygen or mechanical ventilation;
• quality of life;
• any unwanted effects; and 
• serious unwanted effects.
What did we do?  
We searched for studies that investigated remdesivir to treat adults with COVID‐19 compared to placebo or standard care. Patients were hospitalised with COVID‐19 and could be of any gender or ethnicity.   
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find?  
We found 5 studies with 7452 people hospitalised with COVID‐19. Of these, 3886 people were given remdesivir. The average age of patients was 59 years. Studies took place around the world, mainly in high‐ and upper‐middle‐income countries.  
Main results  
The included studies compared remdesivir to placebo or usual care in people hospitalised with COVID‐19 for up to 28 days. 
Deaths from any cause 
• Remdesivir probably makes little or no difference to deaths from any cause (4 studies, 7142 people). In 1000 people, 8 fewer die with remdesivir compared to placebo or standard care. 
Did patients get better with remdesivir? 
• Remdesivir may have little or no effect on the length of time patients spent on invasive mechanical ventilation (2 studies, 1298 people).  
• We do not know whether remdesivir increases or decreases time on supplemental oxygen (3 studies, 1691 people). 
Did patients get worse with remdesivir? 
• We do not know whether patients are more or less likely to need any mechanical ventilation (invasive or non‐invasive) with remdesivir (3 studies, 6696 people). 
• Patients may be less likely to need invasive mechanical ventilation (2 studies, 1159 people). 
• We do not know whether patients are more or less likely to need non‐invasive mechanical ventilation (1 study, 573 people).  
• We do not know whether patients are more or less likely to need oxygen by mask or nasal prongs (1 study, 138 people). 
Quality of life 
• None of the included studies reported quality of life.
Unwanted effects 
• We do not know whether remdesivir leads to more or fewer unwanted effects of any level (3 studies, 1674 people).  
• Patients are probably less likely to experience serious unwanted effects with remdesivir than with placebo or standard care (3 studies, 1674 people). In 1000 people, 63 fewer would experience a serious unwanted effect compared to placebo or standard care. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We are moderately confident in the evidence for deaths from any cause and serious unwanted effects; however, our confidence in the other evidence is limited because studies used different methods to measure and record their results, and we did not find many studies for some of our outcomes of interest.  
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
The evidence is current to 16 April 2021.
","# Plain Language Summary: Remdesivir to Treat People with COVID-19

## Plain Title
Does the Antiviral Medicine Remdesivir Help Adults in the Hospital with COVID-19?

## Rationale

**What is COVID-19 and why does it matter?**

COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus. Some people get very sick with COVID-19. They may have trouble breathing. These people need to go to the hospital. Some may die from the disease.

**What is remdesivir?**

Remdesivir is a medicine that fights viruses. It stops the COVID-19 virus from making copies of itself. Doctors have been allowed to use it to treat COVID-19 patients.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors needed to know if remdesivir really helps people with COVID-19. They wanted to see if it saves lives. They also wanted to know if it helps people breathe better. This study looked at all the research done on remdesivir. It tried to answer these questions.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked for studies that tested remdesivir in adults with COVID-19. They found 5 studies. These studies included 7,452 people total. About half of these people (3,886) got remdesivir. The other half got fake treatment or usual care.

**Who was in the studies?**

All the people in the studies were adults in the hospital with COVID-19. The average age was 59 years. The studies included men and women. They included people from different backgrounds. Most studies took place in wealthy countries.

**What did researchers measure?**

Researchers looked at several things:
- How many people died within 28 days
- Whether people needed help breathing
- What kind of breathing help they needed
- Any side effects from the medicine

**Types of breathing help:**

Some people with COVID-19 need help breathing. There are different types of help:
- **Oxygen through the nose or mask**: For people with mild breathing problems. They can still breathe on their own.
- **Non-invasive breathing machine**: For people with worse breathing problems. A mask pushes air into their lungs. They stay awake.
- **Invasive breathing machine (ventilator)**: For people with very bad breathing problems. A tube goes into their lungs. A machine breathes for them. They are given medicine to sleep.

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies followed people for up to 28 days after treatment.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

**Deaths:**

Remdesivir probably does not reduce deaths. In every 1,000 people treated, about 8 fewer people died with remdesivir. But this difference is very small. Remdesivir likely makes little or no difference in saving lives.

**Did people get better?**

The results were unclear:
- Remdesivir may not change how long people need a ventilator
- We do not know if it changes how long people need oxygen
- The studies did not measure quality of life

**Did people get worse?**

The results were mixed:
- We do not know if remdesivir stops people from needing breathing machines
- People may be less likely to need a ventilator with a breathing tube
- We do not know about other types of breathing help

**Side effects:**

- We do not know if remdesivir causes more or fewer side effects overall
- People probably have fewer serious side effects with remdesivir. In every 1,000 people, about 63 fewer had serious side effects.

**What do these results mean?**

Remdesivir does not appear to save many lives. It may help prevent some serious side effects. But we are not sure if it helps people breathe better. More research is needed.

**What are the problems with this evidence?**

The studies used different ways to measure results. This made it hard to compare them. There were not many studies for some questions. This means we cannot be completely sure about all the findings.

**Recommendations:**

Researchers should agree on what to measure in COVID-19 studies. This would make future studies easier to compare. It would help doctors know if remdesivir really works.

**How current is this information?**

This review includes studies published up to April 16, 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD014963-pls.txt,"Are corticosteroids (anti‐inflammatory medicines) given orally or by injection an effective treatment for people with COVID‐19? 
Key messages 
• Corticosteroids (anti‐inflammatory medicines) given orally or by injection (systemic) are probably effective treatments for people hospitalised with COVID‐19. We don’t know whether they cause unwanted effects.  
• We don’t know which systemic corticosteroid is the most effective. We found no evidence about people without symptoms or with mild COVID‐19 who were not hospitalised.  
• We found 42 ongoing studies and 16 completed studies that have not published their results. We will update this review when we find new evidence.     
What are corticosteroids? 
Corticosteroids are anti‐inflammatory medicines that reduce redness and swelling. They also reduce the activity of the immune system, which defends the body against disease and infection. Corticosteroids are used to treat a variety of conditions, such as asthma, eczema, joint strains and rheumatoid arthritis.  
Systemic corticosteroids can be swallowed or given by injection to treat the whole body. High doses of corticosteroids taken over a long time may cause unwanted effects, such as increased appetite, difficulty sleeping and mood changes.  
Why are corticosteroids possible treatments for COVID‐19?  
COVID‐19 affects the lungs and airways. As the immune system fights the virus, the lungs and airways become inflamed, causing breathing difficulties. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation, so may reduce the need for breathing support with a ventilator (a machine that breathes for a patient). Some patients’ immune systems overreact to the virus causing further inflammation and tissue damage; corticosteroids may help to control this response. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether systemic corticosteroids are an effective treatment for people with COVID‐19 and whether they cause unwanted effects. 
We were interested in:
• deaths from any cause up to 14 days after treatment, or longer if reported;• whether people got better or worse after treatment, based on their need for breathing support;• quality of life;• unwanted effects and infections caught in hospital. 
What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated systemic corticosteroids for people with mild, moderate or severe COVID‐19. People could be any age, sex or ethnicity. 
Studies could compare:
• corticosteroids plus usual care versus usual care with or without placebo (sham medicine);• one corticosteroid versus another;• corticosteroids versus a different medicine;• different doses of a corticosteroid; or• early versus late treatment. 
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find?  
We found 11 studies with 8075 people. About 3000 people received corticosteroids, mostly dexamethasone (2322 people). Most studies took place in high‐income countries.  
We also found 42 ongoing studies, and 16 completed studies that have not yet published their results.  
Main results 
Ten studies compared corticosteroids plus usual care versus usual care with or without placebo. Only one study compared two corticosteroids. The studies included only hospitalised people with confirmed or suspected COVID‐19. No studies looked at non‐hospitalised people, different doses or timing, or provided information about quality of life. 
Corticosteroids plus usual care compared to usual care with or without placebo (10 studies) 
• Corticosteroids probably reduce the number of deaths from any cause slightly, up to 60 days after treatment (9 studies, 7930 people).• One study (299 people) reported that people on a ventilator at the start of the study were ventilation‐free for more days with corticosteroids than with usual care, so corticosteroids may improve people’s symptoms.• Four studies (427 people) reported whether people not on a ventilator at the start of treatment later needed to be put on a ventilator, but we could not pool the studies’ results, so we are unsure if people’s symptoms get worse with corticosteroids or usual care.• We don’t know if corticosteroids increase or reduce serious unwanted effects (2 studies, 678 people), any unwanted effects (5 studies, 660 people), or infections caught in hospital (5 studies, 660 people). 
Methylprednisolone versus dexamethasone (1 study, 86 people) 
• We don’t know whether the corticosteroid methylprednisolone reduces the number of deaths from any cause compared to dexamethasone in the 28 days after treatment.• We don’t know if methylprednisolone worsens people’s symptoms compared to dexamethasone, based on whether they needed ventilation in the 28 days after treatment.• The study did not provide information about anything else we were interested in. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We are moderately confident in the evidence about corticosteroids’ effect on deaths from any cause. However, our confidence in the other evidence is low to very low, because studies did not use the most robust methods, and the way results were recorded and reported differed across studies. We did not find any evidence on quality of life and there was no evidence from low‐income countries or on people with mild COVID‐19 or no symptoms, who were not hospitalised.  
How up to date is this evidence? 
Our evidence is up to date to 16 April 2021.

COVID-19 is a disease that attacks the lungs and airways. It makes it hard to breathe. When the body fights the virus, the lungs can swell up. This swelling is called inflammation. Some people get so sick they need a machine to help them breathe. This machine is called a ventilator.

Sometimes the body fights too hard against the virus. This can cause even more swelling and damage to the lungs and other body parts. This makes people very sick.

**What are corticosteroids?**

Corticosteroids are medicines that reduce swelling in the body. They also calm down the immune system. The immune system is the part of your body that fights germs and disease.

Doctors use these medicines for many health problems. These include asthma, skin rashes, and joint pain.

You can take these medicines by mouth or get them through a shot. When used this way, they treat the whole body.

**Why might these medicines help people with COVID-19?**

These medicines might help in two ways. First, they reduce swelling in the lungs. This might help people breathe better. They might not need a breathing machine.

Second, they can stop the body from fighting too hard. This protects the lungs and other body parts from damage.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors needed to know if these medicines really help people with COVID-19. They also needed to know if the medicines cause problems or side effects.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This review looked at 11 different studies. These studies included 8,075 people total. About 3,000 people got corticosteroid medicines. Most people got a medicine called dexamethasone.

**Who was in these studies?**

All the people in the studies were in the hospital. They had COVID-19 or doctors thought they had COVID-19. Most studies happened in wealthy countries.

**What did the studies compare?**

Ten studies compared two groups. One group got corticosteroid medicine plus regular hospital care. The other group got only regular hospital care. Some also got a fake medicine called a placebo.

One study compared two different corticosteroid medicines. It looked at methylprednisolone versus dexamethasone.

**What did researchers measure?**

Researchers looked at several things:
- How many people died
- Whether people got better or worse
- Whether people needed breathing machines
- Side effects from the medicines
- Infections people caught in the hospital

## Results

**What were the main results?**

**For corticosteroids plus regular care versus regular care alone:**

The medicines probably help save lives. Fewer people died when they got corticosteroids. Researchers followed people for up to 60 days. This finding came from 9 studies with 7,930 people.

One study found that corticosteroids may help people breathe better. People on breathing machines got off them sooner.

Four studies looked at whether people needed breathing machines later. But the results were unclear. We don't know if the medicines help with this.

We don't know if these medicines cause side effects. We don't know if they increase infections caught in the hospital. Not enough studies looked at these questions carefully.

**For methylprednisolone versus dexamethasone:**

Only one small study compared these two medicines. It had 86 people. We don't know which medicine works better. We don't know if one causes fewer deaths than the other.

**What is missing from this research?**

No studies looked at people with mild COVID-19 at home. No studies looked at people without symptoms. No studies asked about quality of life. Very few studies happened in poor countries.

**What do these results mean?**

Corticosteroid medicines probably help people sick with COVID-19 in the hospital. They may reduce the number of deaths. But we need more research to know about side effects. We also need to know which medicine works best.

**What happens next?**

Researchers found 42 studies still happening. They found 16 finished studies that haven't shared results yet. This review will be updated when new information is available.

**How current is this information?**

This review includes all studies found up to April 16, 2021."

Is ivermectin effective for COVID‐19? 
Key messages 
We found no evidence to support the use of ivermectin for treating COVID‐19 or preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The evidence base improved slightly in this update, but is still limited. 
Evaluation of ivermectin is continuing in 31 ongoing trials, and we will update this review again when their results become available.  
What is ivermectin? 
Ivermectin is a medicine used to treat parasites, such as intestinal parasites in animals, and scabies in humans. It is inexpensive and is widely used in regions of the world where parasitic infestations are common. It has few unwanted effects.  
Medical regulators have not approved ivermectin for COVID‐19.
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to update our knowledge of whether ivermectin reduces death, illness, and length of infection in people with COVID‐19, or is useful in prevention of the infection. We included trials comparing the medicine to placebo (dummy treatment), usual care, or treatments for COVID‐19 that are known to work to some extent, such as dexamethasone. We excluded trials comparing ivermectin to other medicines that do not work, like hydroxychloroquine, or whose effectiveness against COVID‐19 is uncertain. 
We evaluated the effects of ivermectin in infected people on:
– people dying;– whether people's COVID‐19 got better or worse;– quality of life;– serious and non‐serious unwanted effects;– viral clearance. 
For prevention, we sought the effect on preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease. 
What did we do?  
We searched for randomized controlled trials that investigated ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID‐19. People treated in hospital or as outpatients had to have laboratory‐confirmed COVID‐19. 
In this update, we also investigated the trustworthiness of the trials and only included them if they fulfilled clear ethical and scientific criteria. 
We compared and summarized the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on common criteria such as trial methods and sizes. 
What did we find?  
We excluded seven of the 14 trials included in the previous review as these trials did not fulfil the expected ethical and scientific criteria. Together with four new trials, we included 11 trials with 3409 participants that investigated ivermectin combined with any usual care compared to the same usual care or placebo. 
For treatment, there were five trials of people in hospital with moderate COVID‐19 and six trials of outpatients with mild COVID‐19. The trials used different doses of ivermectin and different durations of treatment.  
No trial investigated ivermectin to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.
We also found 31 ongoing trials, and an additional 28 trials still requiring clarification from the authors or not yet published. 
Main results  
Treating people in hospital with COVID‐19 
We do not know whether ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment: 
– leads to more or fewer deaths (3 trials, 230 people); – worsens or improves patients' condition, assessed by need for ventilation or death (2 trials, 118 people);– increases or reduces serious unwanted events (2 trials, 197 people). 
Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, may make little or no difference to: 
– improving patients' condition, assessed by discharge from hospital (1 trial, 73 people);– non‐serious unwanted events (3 trials, 228 participants).  
Seven days after treatment, ivermectin may make little or no difference to reduction of negative COVID‐19 tests (3 trials, 231 participants) compared with placebo or usual care. 
Treating outpatients with COVID‐19 
Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, probably makes little or no difference to people dying (6 trials, 2860 people). 
Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, makes little or no difference to quality of life (1 trial, 1358 people). 
Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, may make little or no difference to: 
– worsening patients' condition, assessed by admission to hospital or death (2 trials, 590 people);– serious unwanted events (5 trials, 1502 people); – non‐serious unwanted events (5 trials, 1502 participants); – improving people's COVID‐19 symptoms in the 14 days after treatment (2 trials, 478 people);– number of people with negative COVID‐19 tests 7 days after treatment (2 trials, 331 people). 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the evidence, especially for outpatients, improved since the last review version, because we could look at more participants included in high‐quality trials. Although we are quite certain regarding our results on risk of people dying and quality of life, the confidence in the evidence is still low for many other outpatient and inpatient outcomes because there were only few events measured. The methods differed between trials, and they did not report everything we were interested in, such as relevant outcomes. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The systematic literature search is up to date to 16 December 2021. Additionally, we included trials with > 1000 participants up to April 2022. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Ivermectin for COVID-19

## Plain Title
Does Ivermectin Help Prevent or Treat COVID-19?

## Rationale

**What is COVID-19 and why does it matter?**

COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus. It can make people very sick. Some people need to go to the hospital. Some people die from it. Doctors need safe and low-cost treatments that work.

**What is ivermectin?**

Ivermectin is a medicine. Doctors use it to treat parasites. Parasites are tiny bugs that can live inside the body. Ivermectin treats worms in animals. It also treats scabies in people. Scabies is a skin problem caused by tiny bugs.

This medicine costs very little. It is used in many parts of the world. It has few side effects. This means it usually does not cause problems.

**Why study ivermectin for COVID-19?**

Some people thought ivermectin might help treat COVID-19. They also thought it might stop people from getting sick. Researchers wanted to find out if this was true.

Right now, health agencies have not approved ivermectin for COVID-19. This means doctors should not use it for this disease yet.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know if ivermectin:
- Stops people from dying
- Helps people get better faster
- Prevents people from getting COVID-19
- Causes side effects

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not one single study. Researchers looked at many studies done by other scientists. They collected results from 11 different studies. These studies included 3,409 people total.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies looked at two groups of people:
- People in the hospital with COVID-19 (5 studies)
- People at home with mild COVID-19 (6 studies)

All people in the studies had tested positive for COVID-19.

**What did the studies compare?**

Some people got ivermectin. Other people got a fake pill or regular care. Researchers then compared the two groups.

The studies used different amounts of ivermectin. They also gave it for different lengths of time.

**How long did the studies last?**

Most studies checked on people 28 days after treatment started. Some checked at 7 days or 14 days.

**What made this review special?**

Researchers only used studies that were done properly. They removed 7 studies from an earlier review. These studies did not meet good science and ethics rules. They added 4 new studies.

No studies looked at preventing COVID-19 infection. All studies looked at treating people already sick.

## Results

**What did researchers find?**

The main finding is clear: Ivermectin does not help with COVID-19.

**For people in the hospital:**

Researchers do not know if ivermectin:
- Changes how many people die
- Changes how many people need breathing machines
- Causes serious side effects

Ivermectin may make little or no difference in:
- Helping people leave the hospital
- Causing minor side effects
- Clearing the virus from the body

**For people at home with mild COVID-19:**

Ivermectin probably makes little or no difference in:
- How many people die

Ivermectin makes little or no difference in:
- Quality of life

Ivermectin may make little or no difference in:
- How many people go to the hospital
- Serious side effects
- Minor side effects
- How fast symptoms go away
- Clearing the virus from the body

**What does this mean?**

The evidence shows ivermectin does not work for COVID-19. It does not help people get better. It does not stop people from dying. It does not prevent infection.

**Why should we trust these results?**

Researchers are fairly confident about some findings. They are very sure ivermectin does not reduce deaths in people at home. They are very sure it does not improve quality of life.

For other results, they are less sure. This is because:
- Not many things happened to measure
- Studies were done differently
- Studies did not report everything needed

**What happens next?**

There are 31 more studies still happening. Researchers will look at those results when ready. There are also 28 other studies waiting to be checked.

This review looked at studies up to December 2021. It also included large studies up to April 2022.

**Bottom line:**

Do not use ivermectin for COVID-19. The evidence shows it does not work."
10.1002-14651858.CD015043-pls.txt,"Is vitamin D an effective and safe treatment for COVID‐19?
Key messages 
‐ We did not find enough, good‐quality evidence to judge whether vitamin D is an effective or safe treatment for adults with COVID‐19. 
‐ We need more research on this topic. Future research should focus on well‐designed studies with robust methods. 
‐ We identified 21 studies on this topic that are ongoing. We will update this review when more evidence becomes available. 
What is the link between vitamin D and COVID‐19? 
Some studies have shown that people who are in hospital with severe COVID‐19 also have low levels of  vitamin D (vitamin D deficiency). However, the risk factors for developing severe COVID‐19 are the same as those for developing vitamin D deficiency, so it is difficult to tell if vitamin D deficiency itself is a risk factor for severe COVID‐19. Risk factors include general ill‐health, a poor diet, and pre‐existing health conditions, such as diabetes, and liver and kidney disease. 
Vitamin D is important for healthy bones, teeth and muscles. It helps to regulate blood sugar, the heart and blood vessels, and the lungs and airways. It also has a role in boosting the body’s immune system. These are areas affected by COVID‐19, so giving vitamin D to people with COVID‐19 might help them to recover more quickly or have the disease less severely. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out the effects of giving vitamin D to adults with confirmed COVID‐19 on the following: 
‐ death from any cause;
‐ improvement or worsening of the patient’s condition;
‐ unwanted effects; and
‐ quality of life.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed the use of vitamin D as a treatment for adults with confirmed COVID‐19 compared with a placebo (sham treatment) or another treatment. Vitamin D could be given in any form and in any dose. 
We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found three studies with 356 participants. One study took place in Brazil, and the other two in Spain. Two studies had participants with severe COVID‐19 and one had participants with mild COVID‐19 or with no symptoms. All the participants tested positive for COVID‐19 with a laboratory test called ‘PCR’, which is currently the most accurate test available. 
The studies gave their participants different doses of vitamin D. They used different timings from each other, from one large dose in one study to several smaller doses over 14 days in another study. Only two studies said that their participants were vitamin D‐deficient. The other study did not say anything about their participants’ vitamin D status. 
Deaths from any causeWe do not know whether vitamin D helps to prevent death from COVID‐19. Two studies (in participants with severe COVID‐19) provided evidence about deaths from any cause. One reported no deaths in the 50 participants who had received vitamin D, but two  deaths in the 26 participants who received the hospital’s usual COVID‐19 treatment. The other study reported nine deaths in 119 participants who had been given vitamin D and six deaths in the 118 participants given placebo. These studies were too different from each other to allow us to draw any conclusions. 
Patient’s conditionVitamin D may reduce the need for patients to be put on a ventilator to help them breathe, but the evidence is uncertain. One study (in participants with severe COVID‐19) reported that nine out of 119 participants given vitamin D had to be put on a ventilator and 17 out of 118 given a placebo needed a ventilator. 
Unwanted effectsWe do not know whether vitamin D causes unwanted effects. Only one study (in participants with severe COVID‐19) reported data on unwanted effects in a way that we could use. It found that one participant out of 119 vomited shortly after being given vitamin D. 
Quality of lifeNone of the studies reported quality of life. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the evidence is very limited because the studies gave different doses of vitamin D at different times from each other, did not all report participants’ vitamin D status, and did not measure and record their results using consistent methods. 
We found little evidence on unwanted effects and none on quality of life.  
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to 11 March 2021.
","# Plain Language Summary: Vitamin D as a Treatment for COVID-19

## Plain Title
Does Vitamin D Help Treat Adults with COVID-19?

## Rationale

**What is COVID-19 and vitamin D?**

COVID-19 is a disease that can make people very sick. It affects the lungs, heart, blood vessels, and immune system. The immune system is the body's way of fighting illness.

Vitamin D is a nutrient that helps keep bones, teeth, and muscles healthy. It also helps the immune system work well. It plays a role in controlling blood sugar and keeping the lungs and heart healthy.

**Why did researchers study this?**

Some doctors noticed that people in the hospital with severe COVID-19 often had low vitamin D levels. However, the same things that put people at risk for severe COVID-19 also cause low vitamin D. These include poor health, poor diet, diabetes, and liver or kidney disease.

**What was the main question?**

Researchers wanted to know if giving vitamin D to people with COVID-19 could help them. They thought vitamin D might help people recover faster or have less severe illness. This is because vitamin D affects many of the same body parts that COVID-19 attacks.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors needed to know if vitamin D is a safe and helpful treatment for COVID-19. This would help them make better choices about caring for patients.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked for studies that tested vitamin D in adults with COVID-19. They found three studies with 356 people total.

**Where did the studies take place?**

One study was done in Brazil. Two studies were done in Spain.

**Who was in the studies?**

All participants were adults who tested positive for COVID-19. Doctors used a lab test called PCR to confirm they had COVID-19. This is the most accurate test available.

Two studies included people with severe COVID-19. One study included people with mild COVID-19 or no symptoms.

**What treatment did people receive?**

The studies gave different amounts of vitamin D. Some gave one large dose. Others gave smaller doses over 14 days.

Some people received vitamin D. Others received a placebo (fake treatment) or regular hospital care.

Only two studies checked if participants had low vitamin D before starting. The third study did not report this information.

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies followed participants for different lengths of time. The exact time varied by study.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers could not find enough good evidence to say if vitamin D works for COVID-19. The studies were too small and too different from each other.

**Deaths**

Two studies looked at whether people died. The results were unclear.

In one study, no one who got vitamin D died. But 2 out of 26 people who got regular care died.

In another study, 9 out of 119 people who got vitamin D died. And 6 out of 118 people who got placebo died.

These studies were too different to draw clear conclusions.

**Need for breathing machines**

One study looked at whether people needed ventilators. Ventilators are machines that help people breathe.

In this study, 9 out of 119 people who got vitamin D needed a ventilator. But 17 out of 118 people who got placebo needed a ventilator.

This suggests vitamin D might help. But the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.

**Side effects**

Only one study reported side effects clearly. In that study, 1 person out of 119 vomited after taking vitamin D.

The researchers do not know if vitamin D causes other unwanted effects.

**Quality of life**

None of the studies measured quality of life.

**What are the main conclusions?**

The researchers cannot say if vitamin D is helpful or safe for treating COVID-19. More research is needed.

The studies had problems. They used different doses of vitamin D. They measured results in different ways. Most did not check vitamin D levels before starting.

**What happens next?**

The researchers found 21 more studies that are still ongoing. They will update their findings when those studies are complete.

Future studies need better designs and clearer methods. This will help doctors know if vitamin D truly helps people with COVID-19.

The burden of symptoms at the end of life of COVID‐19 patients and helpful treatments 
COVID‐19 patients may show symptoms such as breathlessness or delirium at the end of life. The goal of palliative medicine is to relieve such symptoms with specific treatments. Treatments can be drugs, for example opioids, or non‐drugs, such as breathing techniques or relaxation.  
What was the aim of our review? 
To explore how well different interventions (drugs and non‐drugs) work for the treatment of palliative symptoms in COVID‐19 patients at the end of life. We included patients of all ages and with all comorbidities (additional medical conditions).  
What type of studies did we search for? 
We searched selected medical databases and trial registries until 23 March 2021. We included studies looking at how well different palliative treatments work to relieve COVID‐19‐associated symptoms at the end of life. We wanted to compare studies investigating different medicines or therapies, but we only found studies without a comparison group. Only one study reported the specific drugs used for individual symptoms. 
Key results 
We found four studies that were published in five papers. Individual papers included between 61 and 2105 participants, and two papers partially reported on the same participants. All of the included studies investigated different drug treatments for palliative symptom management in people with COVID‐19. 
Drugs for symptom control at the end of life 
All of the included studies reported on the effectiveness of palliative care for symptom relief. In all studies, clinicians or nursing staff rated symptom relief rather than the patients themselves. Since the quality of the evidence was very low, we do not know the true effect of drug treatments on symptom relief and have very low confidence in the results of the studies. We did not find any data on quality of life; symptom burden; satisfaction of patients, caregivers, and relatives; or safety of the drug treatments. 
Non‐drug therapies for symptom control at the end of life 
We did not find any data on the benefits and harms of non‐drug therapies for symptom control of COVID‐19 patients at the end of life. 
Conclusions 
Based on our findings, we could not draw any conclusions on palliative symptom control of people with COVID‐19. Future studies need to be designed better so that we can determine which treatments work for symptom control in people with COVID‐19.

## Plain Title
A Review of Treatments to Help Ease Symptoms in COVID-19 Patients Near Death

## Rationale

### What is the problem?

People with COVID-19 who are near the end of life often have hard symptoms. They may have trouble breathing. They may feel confused or restless. These symptoms can cause great suffering.

### What is palliative care?

Palliative care is special medical care. It helps ease pain and other symptoms. The goal is to make patients more comfortable. It helps improve quality of life when cure is not possible.

### What treatments might help?

Doctors can use different treatments to ease symptoms. Some treatments are medicines. These include drugs called opioids that help with pain and breathing problems. Other treatments do not use medicines. These include breathing exercises and relaxation methods.

### Why was this study needed?

Doctors needed to know which treatments work best. They wanted to help COVID-19 patients feel better at the end of life. The researchers looked at past studies to find answers. They wanted to see what the evidence showed about different treatments.

## Trial Design

### How was this review done?

This was not a single study. Instead, researchers looked at many past studies. They searched medical databases up to March 23, 2021. They looked for studies about treatments for COVID-19 patients near death.

### What did they look for?

The researchers wanted to find studies that tested different treatments. They looked for studies about medicines. They also looked for studies about non-medicine treatments. They wanted studies that compared different treatments to each other.

### Who were the patients in these studies?

The studies included COVID-19 patients of all ages. Patients could have other health problems too. All patients were near the end of life.

### What studies did they find?

The researchers found four studies. These studies were published in five papers. The studies included between 61 and 2,105 people. Two papers reported on some of the same patients. All studies looked at medicines used for symptom relief. None looked at non-medicine treatments.

## Results

### What did the studies show about medicines?

All four studies reported on how well medicines worked. However, the studies had major problems. Doctors or nurses rated how well symptoms improved. The patients themselves did not rate their own symptoms. The studies did not compare different treatments to each other. Only one study told which specific medicines were used for each symptom.

### How good was the evidence?

The quality of the evidence was very low. This means we cannot trust the results. We do not know if the medicines truly helped. The researchers have very little confidence in the findings.

### What information was missing?

The studies did not report many important things. They did not measure quality of life. They did not ask patients how they felt. They did not ask family members if they were satisfied. They did not report if the medicines caused harm or side effects.

### What about non-medicine treatments?

The researchers found no studies about non-medicine treatments. There was no information about breathing exercises or relaxation methods.

### What are the main conclusions?

The researchers could not draw clear conclusions. The evidence was too weak. We still do not know which treatments work best for COVID-19 patients at the end of life.

### What is needed next?

Future studies must be designed better. They need to compare different treatments. They need to ask patients about their symptoms. They need to measure quality of life. Only then can we learn which treatments truly help ease suffering in COVID-19 patients near death."
10.1002-14651858.CD015077-pls.txt,"Spontaneous breathing activity in COVID‐19‐related lung failure
Is early spontaneous breathing beneficial in the treatment of lung failure in individuals with COVID‐19? 
People with severe COVID‐19 can present with lung failure, which is called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This requires invasive mechanical ventilation through a breathing tube. It is possible to allow breathing, triggered by the patient (called spontaneous breathing), whilst being on a ventilator. However, it is unclear whether this is beneficial for such individuals, especially in the early phase of ventilation. 
Key messages 
We found no evidence if spontaneous breathing is beneficial in the treatment of lung failure due to COVID‐19. 
What are the advantages of early spontaneous breathing in ARDS?  
The advantage of spontaneous breathing during mechanical ventilation is the preserved movement of the diaphragm (the major muscle for breathing located under the lungs). It leads to better distribution of the inhaled air, especially in the pulmonary alveoli (small air sacs within the lungs) close to the diaphragm. In general, ventilation procedures with possible spontaneous breathing require lower doses of sedatives (which slow down brain activity). Since these can cause low blood pressure, it can additionally reduce the administration of cardiovascular medicines. 
Can early spontaneous breathing be harmful in the treatment of ARDS? 
During spontaneous breathing under mechanical ventilation, increased pressure fluctuations in the lungs may occur. Increased pressure difference within the lung is the main cause of ventilator‐associated lung injury. 
What is the alternative to using early spontaneous breathing? 
Spontaneous breathing may be suppressed by increased sedation or blockade of the nerves innervating muscles by medicines that allow for breathing (called neuromuscular blockade). The advantage of complete ventilator‐based breathing is a lower oxygen consumption of the muscles and the reduced risk of self‐inflicted lung injury. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of early spontaneous breathing activity in ventilated people with COVID‐19 with ARDS compared to ventilation strategies that avoid spontaneous breathing. 
What did we do?  
We searched for studies that compared early spontaneous breathing during invasive mechanical ventilation with mandatory invasive ventilation and neuromuscular blockade in people with ARDS related to COVID‐19. People could have been any age, sex or ethnicity.  
What did we find?  
After systematic search, we found no records that met the inclusion criteria.
Main results 
We identified no eligible studies for this review.
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
To date, there are no studies that have compared early spontaneous breathing during invasive mechanical ventilation to mandatory invasive ventilation without spontaneous breathing in people with ARDS related to COVID‐19.  
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
Our evidence is up‐to‐date to 2 March 2022.

## Plain Title
Can Early Self-Triggered Breathing Help COVID-19 Patients on Breathing Machines? A Search for Studies

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some people with severe COVID-19 get very sick lungs. This is called acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS for short. ARDS means the lungs fail and cannot work on their own. These patients need a breathing machine. A tube goes into their airway. The machine helps them breathe.

**What are the two ways to use a breathing machine?**

There are two main ways to help these patients breathe:

1. The patient can trigger some breaths on their own while on the machine. This is called spontaneous breathing.
2. The machine does all the breathing work. Doctors give strong medicines to stop the patient from breathing on their own.

**Why might self-triggered breathing help?**

When patients trigger their own breaths, their diaphragm still moves. The diaphragm is the main breathing muscle under the lungs. When it moves, air spreads better through the lungs. This may help the small air sacs deep in the lungs get more air. Also, patients need less sedation medicine. Sedation medicines slow down the brain and can lower blood pressure.

**Why might self-triggered breathing cause harm?**

When patients breathe on their own while on the machine, pressure changes happen in the lungs. These pressure changes can hurt the lungs. This is called lung injury.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors do not know which method is better for COVID-19 patients with ARDS. They need to know if early self-triggered breathing helps or harms these patients.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers look for answers?**

The researchers searched for studies. They wanted to find studies that compared the two breathing methods in COVID-19 patients with ARDS. They looked for studies with patients of any age, sex, or background.

They searched up to March 2, 2022.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found no studies. Not one study compared early self-triggered breathing to machine-only breathing in COVID-19 patients with ARDS.

**What does this mean?**

Right now, there is no research evidence to answer the question. Doctors cannot know from studies which breathing method is better for COVID-19 patients with lung failure.

**Why is this important?**

COVID-19 caused many people to need breathing machines. Doctors need to know the best way to help these patients. Without studies, doctors must make choices without clear evidence. More research is needed to find the best treatment.

**What should happen next?**

Scientists need to do studies on this topic. These studies should compare the two breathing methods. They should measure which method helps patients get better faster. They should also measure which method causes fewer problems or side effects.

Until these studies are done, doctors will not have clear answers about the best breathing method for COVID-19 patients with ARDS."
10.1002-14651858.CD015085.pub2-pls.txt,"Can non‐medicinal measures prevent or reduce SARS‐CoV‐2 infections in long term care facilities? 
Key messages 
• Non‐medicinal measures (e.g. visiting restrictions or regular testing) may prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (causing COVID‐19 disease) in residents and staff in long term care facilities, but we have concerns about the reliability of the findings. 
• More high‐quality studies on real‐world experiences are needed, in particular.
• More research is also needed on measures in facilities where most residents and staff are vaccinated, as well as regions other than North America and Europe. 
What are non‐medicinal measures? 
Non‐medicinal measures are ways of preventing or reducing disease without using medicine, such as vaccines. These include controlling people's movements and contacts, using personal protective equipment (PPE), or regular testing for infection. 
SARS‐CoV‐2 is very infectious. Elderly or disabled people, who live in care homes (long‐term care facilities), are vulnerable to infection because they live in close contact with other people, with carers and visitors entering and leaving the facility. Due to age and underlying health conditions, care home residents have an increased risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID‐19 and dying from the disease. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out how effective non‐medicinal measures are in preventing residents and staff in long‐term care facilities from becoming infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 and in reducing the spread of the infection. We focused on all types of long‐term care facilities for adults, such as nursing homes for the elderly and skilled nursing facilities for people living with disabilities. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that investigated the effects of non‐medicinal measures in long‐term care facilities. To be included, studies had to report how many infections, hospitalisations or deaths the measures prevented in residents or staff, or whether the measures prevented the introduction of the virus into the facilities or prevented outbreaks within facilities. We included any type of study, including observational studies that used ‘real‐world’ data, or modelling studies based on assumed data from computer‐generated simulations. 
What did we find? 
We found 22 studies, 11 observational and 11 modelling studies. All studies were conducted in North America or Europe. 
There were four main types of measures.
1.Entry regulation measures to prevent residents, staff or visitors introducing the virus into the facility. Measures included staff confining themselves with residents, quarantine for newly‐admitted residents, testing new admissions, not allowing the admission of new residents, and preventing visitors from entering facilities. 
2. Contact‐regulating and transmission‐reducing measures to prevent people passing on the virus. Measures included wearing masks or PPE, social distancing, extra cleaning, reducing contact between residents and among staff, and placing residents and staff in care groups and limiting contact between groups. 
3. Surveillance measures designed to identify an outbreak early. Measures included regular testing of residents or staff regardless of symptoms, and symptom‐based testing. 
4. Outbreak control measures to reduce the consequences of an outbreak. Measures included isolation of infected residents, and separating infected and non‐infected residents or staff caring for them. 
Some studies used a combination of these measures.
Main results 
Entry regulation measures  (4 observational studies; 4 modelling studies) 
Most studies showed that such measures were beneficial, but some studies found no effects or unwanted effects, such as depression and delirium among residents in the context of visiting restrictions. 
Contact‐regulating and transmission‐reducing measures  (6 observational studies; 2 modelling studies) 
Some measures may be beneficial, but often the evidence is very uncertain.
Surveillance measures  (2 observational studies; 6 modelling studies) 
Routine testing of residents and staff may reduce the number of infections, hospitalisations and deaths among residents, although the evidence on the number of deaths among staff was less clear. Testing more often, getting test results faster, and using more accurate tests were predicted to have more beneficial effects. 
Outbreak control measures  (4 observational studies; 3 modelling studies) 
These measures may reduce the number of infections and the risk of outbreaks in facilities, but often the evidence is very uncertain. 
Combination measures  (2 observational studies; 1 modelling study) 
A combination of different measures may be effective in reducing the number of infections and deaths. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in these results is limited. Many studies used mathematical prediction rather than real‐world data, and we cannot be confident that the model assumptions are accurate. Most observational studies did not use the most reliable methods. This means we cannot be confident that the measure caused the effect, for example, that testing of residents reduced the number of deaths. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
This review includes studies published up to 22 January 2021.

## Plain Title

Can Actions Other Than Vaccines Help Stop COVID-19 Spread in Nursing Homes?

## Rationale

### What is the problem?

Nursing homes and care facilities are places where older adults and people with disabilities live. These residents often need daily help with eating, bathing, and taking medicine. Staff members and visitors come in and out of these buildings every day.

COVID-19 spreads very easily from person to person. People living in care homes face extra danger because they live close together. They share dining rooms and common spaces. Older people and those with health problems can get very sick or die from COVID-19.

### Why was this study needed?

Researchers wanted to find ways to protect nursing home residents and staff without using vaccines or medicines. They looked at simple actions like wearing masks, limiting visitors, and testing people for the virus. These actions are called non-medicinal measures. This means they do not involve giving people medicine.

The study aimed to find out which actions work best. This information could help nursing homes keep their residents and workers safe.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?

This was not a single study. Instead, researchers looked at 22 different studies that other scientists had done. They searched for all studies about COVID-19 prevention in nursing homes.

The 22 studies included two types:
- 11 studies used real-world information from actual nursing homes
- 11 studies used computer programs to predict what might happen

All studies took place in North America or Europe. The studies looked at nursing homes for older adults and care facilities for people with disabilities.

The researchers collected studies published up to January 22, 2021.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

The researchers found four main types of actions that nursing homes tried:

**1. Entry rules to keep the virus out**

These actions tried to stop infected people from entering the building. Examples include:
- Staff living at the facility with residents
- Testing new residents before they move in
- Not allowing new residents to move in
- Keeping visitors out

Most studies showed these actions helped. But some actions caused problems. For example, when residents could not see visitors, some became sad or confused.

**2. Actions to reduce contact and spread**

These actions tried to stop the virus from spreading inside. Examples include:
- Wearing masks
- Staying far apart from others
- Extra cleaning
- Keeping residents in small groups
- Keeping staff in small groups

Some of these actions may help. But the researchers were not sure because the evidence was weak.

**3. Testing to find infections early**

These actions tried to catch infections quickly. Examples include:
- Testing all residents regularly
- Testing all staff regularly
- Testing people who feel sick

Regular testing of residents and staff may reduce infections. It may also reduce the number of people who need to go to the hospital. It may reduce deaths among residents. Testing more often worked better. Getting test results faster worked better. More accurate tests worked better.

**4. Actions to control outbreaks**

These actions tried to limit spread after someone got infected. Examples include:
- Keeping infected residents away from others
- Having separate staff care for infected and healthy residents

These actions may reduce infections. But again, the evidence was not strong.

**5. Using several actions together**

Some nursing homes used many different actions at the same time. This approach may work well to reduce infections and deaths.

### What do the results mean?

Actions like testing, limiting visitors, and wearing masks may help protect nursing home residents and staff from COVID-19. However, the researchers have concerns about how reliable these findings are.

Many studies used computer predictions instead of real-world data. Computer predictions may not match what actually happens. Many real-world studies were not done in the best way. This means we cannot be completely sure these actions caused the improvements.

### What is still needed?

More high-quality studies using real-world information are needed. More research is needed in nursing homes where most people are vaccinated. More studies are needed outside North America and Europe.

Despite these concerns, the evidence suggests that non-medicinal measures can help protect vulnerable people in care facilities from COVID-19."
10.1002-14651858.CD015196.pub2-abstract.txt,"The impact of cumulative medications with anticholinergic effects on future adverse clinical outcomes in people with dementia 
Key messages 
Anticholinergic medicines may increase the risk of death in older adults who have dementia.  However, the evidence is low certainty, and we cannot say for certain if the anticholinergic medicines cause death, or if they are simply more likely to be used by people who are already at an increased risk of dying due to ongoing health problems.  
We cannot draw firm conclusions for the risk that anticholinergic medicines pose to the development of other undesirable clinical outcomes, such as further deterioration of memory and thinking, or behavioural and psychological issues.  More research is needed to establish whether anticholinergic medicines cause unintended problems for older adults who have dementia. 
What are anticholinergic medicines? 
Medicines can be classified by their ability to block the action of a chemical signalling system in the body, called the cholinergic system. Medicines that do this are said to have anticholinergic effects, and therefore, are referred to as anticholinergic medicines. 
What did we want to find out?  
Anticholinergic medicines are commonly used to treat a number of medical conditions that people with dementia frequently experience. Typical examples are medicines used to treat urinary tract infections or episodes of agitation. However, because the cholinergic system in the brain plays an important role in learning, memory, and emotional regulation, there are theoretical reasons to believe that the use of anticholinergic medicines may unintentionally exacerbate psychological problems in this population. In this review, we investigated the link between anticholinergic medicines and future occurrence of undesirable clinical outcomes in people with dementia.  
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at the link between anticholinergic medicines and a range of clinical outcomes in people with dementia. We compared and summarised the results of identified studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors, such as study methods and sizes.  
What did we find? 
We found a total of 18 studies, involving 102,684 adults aged 50 years or more, who had issues with memory and thinking. We found that the evidence was highly inconsistent regarding the link between anticholinergic medicines and increased issues with memory and thinking in people with dementia. There were no studies that investigated the link between anticholinergic medicines and frequency of behavioural disturbances. Therefore, we could not draw any conclusions about whether anticholinergic medicines cause issues with memory and thinking, or behavioural disturbances in this population. However, we did find there was a more consistent link between anticholinergic medicines and the risk of death. Those who were taking anticholinergic medicines had a 15% higher risk of dying than those who were not taking anticholinergic medicines.   
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
The available evidence is very low certainty because of the inconsistency of study results, and the lack of control for health conditions that could be linked with both the clinical outcomes and the prescribing of anticholinergic medicines themselves. It is possible that anticholinergic medicines may not actually cause death, but are simply more likely to be given to people who are already at an increased risk of dying due to ongoing health problems.   
How up to date is this evidence? 
We searched for studies published up to 29 November 2021.
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Do Medicines That Block Brain Signals Cause Harm in People With Dementia?

## Rationale

### What is dementia and why does this matter?
Dementia is a condition that affects memory and thinking. People with dementia often have other health problems too. They may get infections or feel upset and confused. Doctors give them medicines to help with these problems.

### What are anticholinergic medicines?
Some medicines block signals in the body. These signals help the brain work. The signals help with memory, learning, and feelings. Medicines that block these signals are called anticholinergic medicines.

### Why did researchers do this study?
Many people with dementia take anticholinergic medicines. Doctors use these medicines to treat infections and calm people who feel upset. But these medicines might cause problems. They might make memory worse. They might cause behavior problems. Researchers wanted to find out if these medicines cause harm.

### What did researchers want to learn?
Researchers wanted to know if anticholinergic medicines cause bad outcomes. They looked at whether these medicines make thinking worse. They looked at whether these medicines cause behavior problems. They also looked at whether these medicines increase the risk of death.

## Trial Design

### How did researchers study this question?
This was not a single study. Researchers looked at many studies done by other scientists. They searched for all studies about this topic. They found studies that followed people with dementia over time. Some people took anticholinergic medicines. Some people did not. Researchers compared what happened to both groups.

### Who was in these studies?
The studies included 102,684 adults. All were age 50 or older. All had problems with memory and thinking. Some had dementia. Some had early memory problems.

### How long did the studies last?
Different studies lasted different amounts of time. The researchers looked at studies published up to November 2021.

## Results

### What did the researchers find about memory and thinking?
The results were mixed. Different studies found different things. Some studies showed anticholinergic medicines made thinking worse. Other studies did not show this. The researchers could not say for certain if these medicines harm memory and thinking.

### What did the researchers find about behavior problems?
No studies looked at behavior problems. The researchers could not answer this question.

### What did the researchers find about death?
The results were more consistent for death. People taking anticholinergic medicines had a higher risk of dying. For every 100 people not taking these medicines who died, 115 people taking these medicines died. This means 15 more deaths for every 100 people.

### How strong is this evidence?
The evidence is weak. The researchers are not very confident in these results. Here is why:

Different studies found different results. This makes it hard to know what is true.

People who take anticholinergic medicines may already be sicker. They may be more likely to die because they are sicker, not because of the medicine. The studies could not tell these things apart.

### What does this mean?
Anticholinergic medicines might increase the risk of death in people with dementia. But we cannot be sure. These medicines might not cause death. They might just be given to people who are already more likely to die.

We do not know if these medicines make memory and thinking worse. We do not know if they cause behavior problems. More research is needed.

### What should happen next?
Scientists need to do better studies. These studies need to account for how sick people are. They need to separate the effects of the medicine from the effects of other health problems. Only then can we know for sure if anticholinergic medicines cause harm in people with dementia.

### Why is this important?
Many people with dementia take these medicines. If the medicines cause harm, doctors need to know. They might choose different medicines. They might use these medicines more carefully. Better research will help doctors make better choices for their patients."
10.1002-14651858.CD015207-pls.txt,"Does using low‐sodium salt substitutes (LSSS) instead of regular salt reduce blood pressure and heart disease risks, and is it safe? 
Key messages 
• In adults, using LSSS instead of regular salt in food probably lowers blood pressure slightly. Adults using LSSS instead of regular salt probably have a slightly lower risk of non‐fatal heart conditions, such as stroke or a sudden reduced blood flow to the heart, and death from heart disease. 
• Using LSSS instead of regular salt probably also slightly increases the level of blood potassium (a mineral that keeps your heart beating at the right pace) in adults. This could be harmful for people who cannot effectively regulate the potassium in their bodies. Other evidence on safety is very limited. 
• We are not certain about effects of using LSSS instead of regular salt on blood pressure in children, or whether using LSSS is safe in children. 
• This evidence may not directly apply to people known to be at risk of high blood potassium, such as people with kidney problems or on certain medications. 
What are low‐sodium salt substitutes (LSSS)? 
LSSS are products with less sodium than regular salt. Amounts of sodium in LSSS are lowered by replacing some of the sodium with potassium or other minerals. LSSS may help lower risks of using regular salt, since eating lots of sodium and not enough potassium contributes to high blood pressure. Globally, high blood pressure is the largest cause of preventable deaths, mainly because it causes stroke, acute coronary syndrome (ACS; where less blood flows to the heart), and kidney problems. 
However, LSSS also has potential health risks. Using LSSS may lead to higher than normal blood potassium (hyperkalaemia), which causes problems with the heartbeat speed and rhythm, or can cause the heart to stop. These risks are greater in certain people, for example, those whose kidneys do not work properly to remove potassium. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out what the effects of using LSSS instead of regular salt are on blood pressure as well as on events (stroke and ACS) and heart disease death. We also wanted to know if using LSSS instead of regular salt is safe, both in the general population and in people who are known to be at risk of high blood potassium levels. 
We wanted to find this out for adults, children and pregnant women.
What did we do?We searched five electronic databases and trial registries for studies that compared using LSSS with using regular salt. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the combined evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.  
What did we find? 
We found 26 trials* involving 34,961 adults and 92 children. No studies in pregnant women were found. Most trials were undertaken in rural or suburban areas, with more than half done in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Most trials included some people with high blood pressure (22); the largest included only people with a high risk of stroke. Seven trials were done in people at possible risk of high blood potassium. All trials excluded people where high potassium intake is known to be harmful, such as people with kidney problems or on certain medications. Nearly all trials (23) examined LSSS types where some sodium was replaced with potassium. The amount of sodium replaced in the various LSSS used in the trials ranged from very small (3%) to large (77%). 
*Trials are types of studies in which participants are assigned randomly to two or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure similar groups of participants. 
Main results 
In adults, LSSS probably lowers blood pressure (diastolic and systolic) slightly when compared to regular salt. Using LSSS also probably lowers risk of non‐fatal stroke, non‐fatal ACS and heart disease death slightly when compared to regular salt. 
However, using LSSS instead of regular salt probably also slightly increases the level of potassium in the blood. 
Compared to regular salt, LSSS may result in little to no difference in high blood pressure and hyperkalaemia. 
We could not draw any conclusions about effects of LSSS on blood pressure control, various heart disease events, death caused by stroke, lower than normal blood potassium (hypokalaemia), and other adverse events. 
We could not draw any conclusions about the effects or safety of using LSSS instead of regular salt in children. 
What are the limitations of the evidence?  
We are moderately confident in the evidence. Our confidence was lowered mainly because of concerns about how some trials were conducted, and whether the results apply to the general population. We are not sure about the effects and safety of LSSS in children, pregnant women, people known to have a risk of high blood potassium, or those who do not have high blood pressure. We are also unsure about the effects of LSSS when used in foods not prepared at home. Further research may change these results. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to August 2021.
","# Plain Language Summary: Low-Sodium Salt Substitutes for Blood Pressure and Heart Health

## Plain Title

Can Using Low-Sodium Salt Instead of Regular Salt Help Lower Blood Pressure and Reduce Heart Disease Risk?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

High blood pressure is a major health problem around the world. It is the biggest cause of deaths that could be prevented. High blood pressure can lead to serious health issues like stroke (when blood flow to the brain stops), heart attacks (when blood flow to the heart is blocked), and kidney problems.

**What causes high blood pressure?**

Eating too much sodium (the main part of regular salt) and not enough potassium (a mineral your body needs) can cause high blood pressure. Most people eat regular salt in their food every day. This salt contains a lot of sodium.

**What are low-sodium salt substitutes?**

Low-sodium salt substitutes (LSSS) are special salts that have less sodium than regular salt. They are made by replacing some of the sodium with potassium or other minerals. This means you get less sodium when you use them.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if using LSSS instead of regular salt could help lower blood pressure. They also wanted to know if LSSS could reduce the risk of heart disease and death. However, LSSS might also cause problems. Too much potassium in the blood can be dangerous. It can cause your heart to beat too fast, too slow, or even stop. This is especially risky for people with kidney problems or people taking certain medicines.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 26 different studies. These studies were done in different countries around the world. More than half were done in poorer countries. Most studies were done in rural or suburban areas.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included 34,961 adults and 92 children. No studies included pregnant women. Most studies (22 out of 26) included some people who already had high blood pressure. The biggest study only included people at high risk of stroke. Seven studies included people who might be at risk of high potassium levels. All studies left out people for whom high potassium is known to be harmful. This includes people with kidney problems or people on certain medicines.

**What did the studies test?**

Almost all studies (23 out of 26) tested LSSS where some sodium was replaced with potassium. Different LSSS products replaced different amounts of sodium. Some replaced only 3% of the sodium. Others replaced as much as 77%.

**How long did the studies last?**

The length of time people stayed in each study varied.

## Results

**What did the researchers find in adults?**

Using LSSS instead of regular salt probably lowers blood pressure a little bit. Both types of blood pressure measurements went down slightly.

Using LSSS instead of regular salt probably lowers the risk of:
- Non-fatal stroke (a stroke that does not cause death)
- Non-fatal heart attacks
- Death from heart disease

However, using LSSS instead of regular salt probably raises potassium levels in the blood slightly. This could be harmful for some people.

Using LSSS may make little to no difference in:
- How many people develop high blood pressure
- How many people get dangerously high potassium levels

**What about children?**

The researchers could not make conclusions about children. There were not enough children in the studies.

**What about safety?**

The researchers could not make clear conclusions about many safety issues. They need more information about other side effects.

**How sure are we about these results?**

The researchers are moderately confident in these findings. Some concerns remain about how some studies were done. The results may not apply to everyone. More research is needed for:
- Children
- Pregnant women
- People at risk of high potassium
- People without high blood pressure
- LSSS used in restaurant or processed foods

**What does this mean?**

For most adults, using LSSS instead of regular salt may help lower blood pressure slightly. It may also lower the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death from heart disease. However, it may raise potassium levels in the blood. People with kidney problems or on certain medicines should talk to their doctor before using LSSS.

**How current is this information?**

This evidence includes studies published up to August 2021."
10.1002-14651858.CD015270-pls.txt,"Interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake 
Background 
Vaccines are effective in preventing death or severe illness from COVID‐19, a disease for which few treatments are available. Widespread vaccination against COVID‐19 may help protect those not yet able to get vaccinated. However, many people do not want to get vaccinated against COVID‐19. This can put them at increased risk of severe disease and death. 
What was our aim? 
We wanted to find out which interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake have been or are currently evaluated.  
Methods 
We searched medical databases and trial registries until the 11 of October 2021. We included all studies investigating interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake. We excluded studies looking at other vaccines, for example, measles. We included all forms of studies as long as they had more than 100 participants.  
Once we found the studies, we categorised the interventions into the following groups: communication interventions, policy interventions, interventions to improve access, educational interventions, incentives, and multidimensional interventions. We summarised the results in an interactive scoping map. Furthermore, we mapped the study outcomes, the country in which the study was conducted, the study population, and the study design. 
Results 
We included 96 studies in evidence mapping, 35 of which are ongoing and 61 studies with published results. The interventions tested in these studies are very diverse. Many studies used communication strategies to convince people to get vaccinated against COVID‐19.  Interventions that included information on vaccination or a mixture of different strategies were also often used.  
A majority of studies were conducted in English‐speaking countries of the global north, for example, the USA. Moreover, most studies investigated digital interventions in an online setting. The populations addressed varied across the studies. For example, studies addressed healthcare workers, ethnic minorities in the USA, students, soldiers, villagers, at‐risk patients, or the general population.  
For an overview, please see the interactive scoping map (https://tinyurl.com/2p9jmx24).   
Conclusion 
We identified a large number of studies that investigate how COVID‐19 vaccine uptake might be increased. However, more studies are needed focusing on lower‐middle‐income countries and on children. Future research should compare the effectiveness of different interventions to improve COVID‐19 vaccine uptake.  
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
What Ways Have Been Studied to Help More People Get COVID-19 Vaccines?

## Rationale

COVID-19 is a serious disease that can make people very sick or cause death. Vaccines help protect people from getting very sick or dying from COVID-19. Right now, there are very few treatments for COVID-19. When many people get vaccinated, it can also help protect others who cannot get the vaccine yet.

However, many people do not want to get the COVID-19 vaccine. This puts them at higher risk of getting very sick or dying from the disease.

The researchers wanted to find out what methods have been tested to help more people get vaccinated against COVID-19. They wanted to see what kinds of studies were being done around the world.

## Trial Design

This was not a single study with patients. Instead, the researchers looked for all studies about ways to increase COVID-19 vaccination.

The researchers searched medical databases and study registries. They looked for studies up until October 11, 2021. They included studies that had more than 100 people in them. They only looked at studies about COVID-19 vaccines, not other vaccines like measles vaccines.

The researchers sorted the studies into groups based on the type of method used:
- Communication methods
- Policy methods
- Methods to make vaccines easier to get
- Education methods
- Rewards or incentives
- Methods that used several approaches together

The researchers then made a map showing what they found. They recorded information about each study, including where it was done, who was in it, and how it was designed.

## Results

The researchers found 96 studies total. Of these, 35 studies were still ongoing. The other 61 studies had already published their results.

The studies tested many different ways to increase vaccination. Many studies used communication strategies to convince people to get vaccinated. Studies that gave people information about vaccines were common. Studies that mixed different strategies together were also common.

Most studies were done in English-speaking countries like the United States. Most studies used digital methods online.

The studies looked at many different groups of people. Some studies focused on healthcare workers. Others looked at ethnic minorities in the United States. Some studied students, soldiers, or villagers. Other studies looked at patients at high risk or the general public.

The researchers created an interactive map that shows all the studies they found. This map can be viewed online.

The researchers concluded that many studies are looking at ways to increase COVID-19 vaccination. However, more studies are needed in poorer countries. More studies are also needed that focus on children.

The researchers said future studies should compare different methods. This would help find out which methods work best to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake."
10.1002-14651858.CD015308-pls.txt,"Are medicines that block interleukin‐1 (a protein involved in immune responses) effective treatments for COVID‐19 and do they cause unwanted effects? 
Key messages 
• Overall, we did not find sufficient evidence to show that medicines that block interleukin‐1 (a protein involved in immune responses) are effective treatments for people with COVID‐19, or whether they cause unwanted effects. 
• We found 16 studies with unpublished results. We will update this review when new data are available. 
• In future, we need high‐quality studies to evaluate medicines that block interleukin‐1 to treat COVID‐19.  
What is interleukin‐1 and what is its role in COVID‐19? 
Interleukin‐1 (IL‐1) is a type of protein called a cytokine, which helps to regulate the body’s immune system. In particular, IL‐1 triggers inflammation to help fight infection. In COVID‐19, as the immune system fights the virus, the lungs and airways become inflamed, causing breathing difficulties. However, in some people, the immune system can over‐react (called a ‘cytokine storm’) and produce dangerously high levels of inflammation and tissue damage. This can lead to severe breathing difficulties, organ failure and death. 
What are interleukin‐1 ‘blockers’? 
IL‐1 blockers are medicines that stop IL‐1 from working by blocking signals from IL‐1 to other parts of the immune system. This reduces inflammation and may help the immune system to fight COVID‐19. In turn, this may reduce the need for breathing support with a ventilator (a machine that breathes for a patient) and reduce the number of deaths from COVID‐19. Three IL‐1 blockers are available: anakinra, canakinumab and rilonacept. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know if IL‐1 blockers are effective treatments for people with COVID‐19, compared with standard care alone or with placebo (a dummy treatment that appears identical to the medicine being tested but without any active medicine). We were particularly interested in the effects of IL‐1 blockers on: 
•  whether people’s symptoms got better or worse;
•  how many people died; and
•  any unwanted effects and serious unwanted effects.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed the effects of IL‐1 blockers to treat people with COVID‐19 compared with standard care alone or with placebo. People in the studies could have suspected or confirmed COVID‐19 of any severity (mild, moderate or severe), and be any age or sex. 
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found six studies with 2132 people. Four studies assessed anakinra (1633 people) and two assessed canakinumab (499 people). People in the studies were aged between 58 and 68 years old on average, and the majority were men. All the people in the studies were in hospital, mainly with moderate to critical COVID‐19. The studies varied in size, from 45 to 2253 people. At the start of the studies, 67% to 100% of people were receiving oxygen, and 0% to 33% were on a ventilator. 
We also found 16 studies that have not yet published their results.
Anakinra compared to usual care and placebo to treat people with COVID‐19 
• Anakinra probably results in little or no improvement in COVID‐19 symptoms (defined as improvement on a clinical scale or discharge from hospital) at 28 days after treatment (three studies, 837 people) but we do not know if it makes a difference at 60 days (one study, 115 people). 
• We do not know if anakinra makes a difference to the number of deaths at 28 days after treatment (two studies, 722 people) or at 60 days (four studies, 1633 people). 
• Anakinra probably results in little or no increase in any unwanted effects at 28 days after treatment, but we are not sure about its effect on serious unwanted effects (two studies, 722 people).  
Canakinumab compared to usual care and placebo to treat people with COVID‐19 
• Canakinumab probably results in little or no improvement in COVID‐19 symptoms (defined as improvement on a clinical scale or discharge from hospital) at 28 days after treatment (two studies, 499 people).  
• We do not know if canakinumab makes a difference to the number of deaths at 28 days after treatment (two studies, 499 people) or at 60 days (one study, 45 people).  
• Canakinumab probably results in little or no increase in any unwanted effects (one study, 454 people), but we are not sure about its effect on serious unwanted effects (two studies, 499 people) at 28 days.  
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the evidence is limited for several reasons. All the people in the studies were hospitalised, but some were more seriously ill than others ‐ some studies only included people on a ventilator. Usual care also differed between studies, and studies measured and reported their results using different methods.

","# Plain Language Summary: Medicines That Block Interleukin-1 for COVID-19

## Plain Title
Do Medicines That Block a Protein Called Interleukin-1 Help Treat COVID-19?

## Rationale

### What is COVID-19 and why is it a problem?

COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus. When people get COVID-19, their body fights the virus. This fight causes swelling in the lungs and airways. This swelling makes it hard to breathe.

### What happens in severe COVID-19?

Sometimes the body fights too hard. It makes too much swelling. This is called a ""cytokine storm."" This can cause very bad breathing problems. It can damage organs. It can lead to death.

### What is interleukin-1?

Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a protein in the body. It helps the body fight infections. It does this by causing swelling. But too much IL-1 can cause too much swelling.

### What are IL-1 blockers?

IL-1 blockers are medicines. They stop IL-1 from working. This reduces swelling in the body. Three IL-1 blockers exist: anakinra, canakinumab, and rilonacept.

### Why study these medicines?

Researchers wanted to know if IL-1 blockers could help people with COVID-19. They thought these medicines might reduce dangerous swelling. This might help people breathe better. It might save lives.

### What did researchers want to learn?

Researchers wanted to find out:
- Do IL-1 blockers help COVID-19 symptoms get better?
- Do they reduce the number of deaths?
- Do they cause unwanted effects or side effects?

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?

This was a review of other studies. Researchers looked at studies that tested IL-1 blockers in people with COVID-19.

### Who was in the studies?

The review included six studies. These studies had 2,132 people total. All people were in the hospital. Most had moderate to severe COVID-19.

### What were the people like?

- Average age: 58 to 68 years old
- Most were men
- At the start, 67 out of 100 to all people needed oxygen
- Up to 33 out of 100 people were on breathing machines

### What medicines were tested?

- Four studies tested anakinra (1,633 people)
- Two studies tested canakinumab (499 people)

### What were the medicines compared to?

The IL-1 blockers were compared to:
- Standard care alone
- Placebo (a dummy treatment with no active medicine)

### How long did the studies last?

Studies measured results at 28 days and 60 days after treatment.

### What else did researchers find?

Researchers found 16 more studies. These studies have not published results yet. The review will be updated when those results are available.

## Results

### What did the studies show about anakinra?

**For symptoms:**
- Anakinra probably does not help symptoms much at 28 days
- Researchers do not know if it helps at 60 days

**For deaths:**
- Researchers do not know if anakinra reduces deaths at 28 days
- Researchers do not know if it reduces deaths at 60 days

**For side effects:**
- Anakinra probably does not cause many side effects at 28 days
- Researchers are not sure about serious side effects

### What did the studies show about canakinumab?

**For symptoms:**
- Canakinumab probably does not help symptoms much at 28 days

**For deaths:**
- Researchers do not know if canakinumab reduces deaths at 28 days
- Researchers do not know if it reduces deaths at 60 days

**For side effects:**
- Canakinumab probably does not cause many side effects
- Researchers are not sure about serious side effects

### What are the main conclusions?

Overall, researchers did not find strong proof that IL-1 blockers help treat COVID-19. They also could not tell if these medicines cause unwanted effects.

### Why is the evidence limited?

Several reasons make it hard to be sure about the results:
- All people in the studies were in the hospital
- Some people were much sicker than others
- Different studies gave different standard care
- Studies measured results in different ways

### What is needed next?

Better studies are needed. These studies should be well designed. They should clearly show if IL-1 blockers help people with COVID-19.

### How current is this information?

This review includes studies found up to November 5, 2021."
10.1002-14651858.CD015374-pls.txt,"Medicines for second‐stage human African trypanosomiasis
What is the aim of this review? 
Gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (g‐HAT), or sleeping sickness, is a severe disease transmitted through the bite of infected tsetse flies found in rural parts of sub‐Saharan Africa. Sleeping sickness has two clinical stages. This review only examines treating the second‐stage, where people develop symptoms caused by invasion of the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in changes in the nervous system. Death is inevitable without treatment. Drugs for treatment are few, often require intravenous infusion every day over several weeks, and have serious side effects. In this review we aimed to compare the effects of current drugs for gambiense sleeping sickness and we examined nifurtimox‐eflornithine combination (NECT) with a new drug, fexinidazole, that can be taken orally. 
Key messages 
Whilst fexinidazole cures some people, deaths from any cause and treatment failure rates are higher than with conventional treatment. Adverse events were common in both groups. Fexinidazole is more practical to give, and means less time in hospital for intravenous treatment infusion. 
What was studied in this review? 
We looked at the evidence about the benefits and harms of current drugs used in people with second stage g‐HAT. We searched for randomized trials, which provide robust evidence about the various treatments. We aimed to determine whether any drug provides a definite advantage over the other, measured in terms of clinical outcomes and in relation to the severity of adverse effects. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We only identified one suitable trial, which included 394 people and was conducted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic. The trial showed that deaths from any cause at 24 months may be higher with fexinidazole compared with NECT. Nine of the 264 people who took fexinidazole died, compared with two of the 130 people who took NECT. Fexinidazole probably increases the number of people who relapse during two years. Fourteen people in the fexinidazole group relapsed, and none in the NECT group. Adverse events were very common in both groups over the two years, and there is not likely to be much difference between the two drugs (247/264 in the fexinidazole group and 121/130 in the NECT group). We do not know about the effect of fexinidazole on serious adverse events, as the evidence is very uncertain. There were 31/264 serious adverse events in the fexinidazole group and 13/130 in the NECT group at 24 months.  
How up to date is this review? 
The evidence is current to 14 May 2021.
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Comparing Medicines for Late-Stage Sleeping Sickness in Africa

## Rationale

**What is sleeping sickness?**
Sleeping sickness is a serious disease. People get it from the bite of infected tsetse flies. These flies live in rural areas of Africa, south of the Sahara Desert.

**What happens to people with this disease?**
The disease has two stages. In the second stage, the disease attacks the brain and nerves. This causes changes in how the nervous system works. Without treatment, people will die from this disease.

**What is the problem with current treatments?**
The medicines available now have several problems. Patients must go to the hospital every day for weeks. Nurses give the medicine through a needle in the vein. These medicines can cause serious side effects.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors wanted to compare the medicines they currently use. They also wanted to test a new medicine called fexinidazole. This new medicine is a pill that people can swallow. This would be much easier than going to the hospital for weeks.

**What did researchers want to find out?**
Researchers wanted to know if the new pill works as well as the current treatment. They wanted to see which medicine works better and which one is safer.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was a randomized trial. This type of study gives the best evidence about treatments. Researchers put people into groups by chance. This makes the comparison fair.

**Who was in the study?**
The study included 394 people. All had second-stage sleeping sickness. They lived in two African countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic.

**What treatments did people receive?**
Some people took the new pill, fexinidazole. Other people got the current standard treatment called NECT. NECT is a combination of two medicines given through a needle in the vein.

**How long did the study last?**
Researchers followed the patients for 24 months. This is two years. They checked to see if people got better or had problems.

## Results

**What were the main findings?**

**Deaths:** More people died when taking fexinidazole compared to NECT. Nine out of 264 people taking fexinidazole died. Only two out of 130 people taking NECT died.

**Disease coming back:** More people got sick again with fexinidazole. Fourteen people taking fexinidazole had the disease come back. No one taking NECT had the disease come back during the two years.

**Side effects:** Both medicines caused side effects in most people. There was not much difference between the two groups. In the fexinidazole group, 247 out of 264 people had side effects. In the NECT group, 121 out of 130 people had side effects.

**Serious side effects:** Researchers are not sure about serious side effects. The evidence is unclear. Thirty-one people taking fexinidazole had serious side effects. Thirteen people taking NECT had serious side effects.

**What are the benefits?**
Fexinidazole is easier to give than NECT. People can take it as a pill at home. They do not need to stay in the hospital for weeks. This is more practical for patients and doctors.

**What are the conclusions?**
Fexinidazole cures some people with sleeping sickness. However, it may not work as well as NECT. More people died or got sick again with fexinidazole. The main advantage is that fexinidazole is easier to take. Patients spend less time in the hospital.

**How current is this information?**
Researchers searched for studies up to May 14, 2021."
10.1002-14651858.CD015397-pls.txt,"Unintended consequences of school‐based measures to manage the COVID‐19 pandemic
Why is this question important? 
Countries worldwide have taken many public health and social measures to prevent and control the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2, a highly contagious respiratory virus responsible for COVID‐19. A range of measures have been put in place to minimise transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 within schools and the wider community. Schools have the potential to be settings of high viral transmission because they involve extended interactions amongst people in close proximity. A previous review located and examined studies on the effectiveness of such school‐based measures regarding SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission. It is equally important to look at their unintended consequences on health and society in order that policymakers and parents can make informed decisions. Unintended consequences of a public health measure may be beneficial or harmful (or a mix of both). A public health measure may result in a mix of benefits and harms. For this review, we planned to examine the unintended consequences of measures designed to prevent and control the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 in schools. This review can therefore be seen as complementing the previous review on the effectiveness of such measures.    
What did we do? 
Firstly, we searched nine databases for studies that assessed any measure put in place in the school settings (primary or secondary schools, or both) to prevent transmission of the virus. We considered all types of studies and a broad range of outcomes. 
Secondly, we grouped the identified studies according to the types of measures they examined. We then described which approaches were used in the studies, where these were conducted, and which unintended consequences were evaluated.  
What did we find? 
We found 18 studies that matched our inclusion criteria. Five studies used ‘real‐life’ data (observational studies); five studies used data generated by a computer and based on a set of assumptions (modelling studies); three studies were experimental studies (e.g. laboratory‐based); and four studies used qualitative methods, meaning they based their findings on interviews with people. One study used mixed methods, combining numerical and non‐numerical (qualitative) information.  
Studies examined four different types of measures, as follows.
‐ Measures to reduce contacts (4 studies): policies to reduce the number of students in the school building (i.e. reducing the number of students present per class) and/or to reduce the number of contacts of students (e.g. through defined groups or staggered arrival, breaks, and departures). 
‐ Measures to make contacts safer (14 studies): practices to ensure safer contacts between people in the school and classroom setting (e.g. mask mandates or distancing regulations), to modify the environment or activities (e.g. enhanced cleaning or ventilation practices). 
‐ Surveillance and response measures to detect SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (6 studies): testing and/or screening strategies (e.g. temperature taking, screening tests for students and staff, and testing of symptomatic students and staff) and self‐isolation or quarantine measures. 
‐ Multicomponent measures (1 study): interventions using a combination of at least two of the above measures. 
We looked at the following unintended outcomes.
‐ Educational consequences (11 studies), e.g. changes in school performance, advancement to the next grade, or change in graduation numbers. 
‐ Psychosocialoutcomes (7 studies), e.g. mental health, anxieties about going to school. 
‐ Physical health and health behaviour outcomes beyond COVID‐19 (3 studies), e.g. hand eczema due to increased handwashing. 
‐ Environmental consequences (3 studies), e.g. changes in air quality in classrooms. 
‐ Socio‐economic consequences (2 studies), e.g. economic burden on families.  
What did we conclude? 
We identified a wide range of unintended consequences of school‐based measures designed to prevent the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2. However, the evidence base is small, and there are large gaps where more research is needed. This scoping review is a first step in gauging the extent of those consequences. More research is needed to collect additional information and to enable a more thorough analysis of the evidence. Psychosocial consequences (e.g. mental health issues, depression, loneliness) and equity and equality consequences (e.g. disadvantages for children from low‐income households, unfair distribution of work between genders for parents, are in need of further attention. We recommend that future research look at interventions such as fixed groups, alternating physical presence at school and staggered arrival departure and break times, as well as testing and quarantine measures.

## Plain Title
Unexpected Effects of COVID-19 Safety Rules in Schools

## Rationale

**What is COVID-19 and why did schools need safety rules?**

COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus that spreads easily from person to person. Schools can be places where the virus spreads quickly. This is because many people spend long periods of time close together in schools.

To stop the virus from spreading, schools around the world put safety rules in place. These rules included things like wearing masks, keeping students apart, and testing for the virus.

**Why was this study needed?**

Earlier research looked at whether these school safety rules worked to stop the virus. But it is also important to know if these rules caused other problems or benefits that were not expected. These unexpected effects could be good or bad, or a mix of both.

Parents and decision-makers need to know about all the effects of school safety rules, not just whether they stopped the virus. This helps them make better choices about what to do in schools.

**What did the researchers want to find out?**

The researchers wanted to find all the unexpected effects of COVID-19 safety rules in schools. This study adds to what we already know about how well these rules worked.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a typical medical trial. Instead, the researchers looked for other studies that had already been done. They searched nine different databases to find studies about COVID-19 safety rules in schools.

**What types of studies did they include?**

The researchers included all types of studies. They found 18 studies total:
- 5 studies used real-life information
- 5 studies used computer models
- 3 studies were done in labs
- 4 studies talked to people about their experiences
- 1 study used both numbers and interviews

**What schools and students were included?**

The studies looked at primary schools and secondary schools. The studies examined students of different ages who attended these schools.

**What safety rules did the studies look at?**

The studies examined four types of safety rules:

1. Rules to reduce contact between people (4 studies). These included having fewer students in the building at one time or keeping students in fixed groups.

2. Rules to make contact safer (14 studies). These included wearing masks, staying apart from others, cleaning more often, and improving air flow.

3. Testing and isolation rules (6 studies). These included checking temperatures, testing students and staff, and keeping sick people at home.

4. Combined rules (1 study). This meant using two or more types of rules together.

**How long did the study last?**

The researchers looked for studies published up to March 2021.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found that school COVID-19 safety rules had many unexpected effects. They grouped these effects into five areas:

1. **Education effects** (11 studies). These included changes in how well students did in school, whether they moved to the next grade, and how many students graduated.

2. **Mental and social effects** (7 studies). These included mental health problems, feeling worried about going to school, and feeling lonely.

3. **Physical health effects** (3 studies). These included skin problems on hands from washing them too much.

4. **Environmental effects** (3 studies). These included changes in air quality in classrooms.

5. **Money and social effects** (2 studies). These included extra costs for families.

**What do the results mean?**

The researchers found that COVID-19 safety rules in schools caused many different unexpected effects. Some effects were harmful, like mental health problems. Some effects might have been helpful, like better air quality.

However, only 18 studies were found. This is a small number. Much more research is needed to fully understand all the effects.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

The researchers said this study is just a first step. More research is needed, especially about:
- Mental health problems like depression and loneliness
- Unfair effects on children from poor families
- Unfair work burdens on parents, especially mothers

Future research should also look more closely at specific safety rules like fixed student groups, part-time school attendance, staggered schedules, testing programs, and quarantine rules.

This information will help parents and decision-makers understand the full picture when making choices about school safety rules."
10.1002-14651858.MR000006.pub3-pls.txt,"Publication bias in clinical trials due to statistical significance or direction of trial results 
The validity of a systematic review depends on the methods used to conduct the review. If there is a systematic bias, such that studies with statistically significant or positive findings are more likely to be published and included in systematic reviews than trials with non‐significant findings, then the validity of a review's conclusions can be threatened. 
This methodology review identified five studies that investigated the extent to which the publication of clinical trials (such as those approved by an ethics review board) is influenced by the statistical significance or direction of a trial's results. These studies showed that trials with positive findings (defined either as those that were statistically significant (P < 0.05), or those findings perceived to be important or striking, or those indicating a positive direction of treatment effect), had nearly four times the odds of being published compared to findings that were not statistically significant (P ≥ 0.05), or perceived as unimportant, or showing a negative or null direction of treatment effect. This corresponds to a risk ratio of 1.78 (95% CI 1.58 to 1.95), assuming that 41% of negative trials are published.Two studies found that trials with positive findings also tended to be published more quickly than trials with negative findings. The size of the trial (assessed in three studies) and the source of funding, academic rank, and sex of the principal investigator (assessed in one study) did not appear to influence whether a trial was published. 
These results provide support for mandating that clinical trials are registered before recruiting participants so that review authors know about all potentially eligible studies, regardless of their findings. Those carrying out systematic reviews should ensure they assess the potential problems of publication bias in their review and consider methods for addressing this issue by ensuring a comprehensive search for both published and unpublished trials. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Why Some Medical Studies Get Published While Others Don't

## Plain Title
A Study About Why Medical Research with Positive Results Gets Published More Often Than Research with Negative Results

## Rationale

**What is the problem?**

When doctors want to know the best way to treat patients, they look at reviews that combine results from many medical studies. These reviews help doctors make good choices about patient care. But there is a problem: not all medical studies get published in journals.

**Why does this matter?**

If only certain types of studies get published, doctors may not see the full picture. This can lead to wrong conclusions about which treatments work best. This problem is called publication bias.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

The researchers wanted to know if studies with positive results get published more often than studies with negative results. A positive result means the treatment seemed to work well. A negative result means the treatment did not work as hoped. Both types of results are important for doctors to know.

**Why was this study needed?**

If positive studies get published more often, then reviews of medical research will be incomplete. This could mislead doctors and harm patients. Understanding this problem is the first step to fixing it.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a regular medical study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at other studies that had already been done. They searched for research that examined publication bias in medical trials.

**What did the researchers look at?**

The researchers found five studies that tracked what happened to medical trials after they were approved by ethics review boards. Ethics review boards are groups that make sure studies are safe and fair. The researchers checked whether these approved trials eventually got published.

**What did they compare?**

They compared trials with positive findings to trials with negative findings. They wanted to see which ones got published more often. They also looked at how quickly studies got published. They checked if other things mattered too, like how big the study was or who paid for it.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The results showed a clear pattern. Trials with positive findings were much more likely to get published than trials with negative findings. Specifically, positive trials had nearly four times better odds of being published.

Another way to understand this: if 41 out of 100 negative trials get published, then about 73 out of 100 positive trials get published. This is a big difference.

**What else did the researchers find?**

Two studies found that positive trials also got published faster than negative trials. This means negative results not only get published less often, but they also take longer to appear when they do get published.

The size of the trial did not seem to matter. Whether the trial was big or small, positive results still got published more often.

Who paid for the study also did not matter. The job title or gender of the lead researcher did not matter either.

**Why is this important?**

These findings show that publication bias is a real problem. When doctors read medical journals, they see mostly positive results. They may not know about the negative results that never got published. This gives them an incomplete and overly positive view of treatments.

**What should happen next?**

The researchers say all medical trials should be registered before they start. This means creating a public record of the trial before any patients join. That way, everyone knows the trial exists, no matter what results it finds.

People who write medical reviews should look for both published and unpublished studies. They should not rely only on published journals. They need to search harder to find all the evidence, including negative results.

**Conclusion**

This study proves that positive medical research gets published more often and faster than negative research. This creates an unfair picture of how well treatments work. To fix this problem, all trials must be registered early, and reviewers must search for all studies, not just published ones."
10.1002-14651858.MR000013.pub6-pls.txt,"What improves trial recruitment?
Key messages 
We had high‐certainty evidence for three methods to improve recruitment, two of which are effective: 
1. Telling people what they are receiving in the trial rather than not telling them improves recruitment. 
2. Phoning people who do not respond to a postal invitation is also effective (although we are not certain this works as well in all trials). 
3. Using a tailored, user‐testing approach to develop participant information leaflets makes little or no difference to recruitment. 
Of the 72 strategies tested, only 7 involved more than one study. We need more studies to understand whether they work or not. 
Our question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of things trial teams do to try and improve recruitment to their trials. We found 68 studies involving more than 74,000 people. 
Background 
Finding participants for trials can be difficult, and trial teams try many things to improve recruitment. It is important to know whether these actually work. Our review looked for studies that examined this question using chance to allocate people to different recruitment strategies because this is the fairest way of seeing if one approach is better than another. 
Key results 
We found 68 studies including 72 comparisons. We have high certainty in what we found for only three of these. 
1. Telling people what they are receiving in the trial rather than not telling them improves recruitment. Our best estimate is that if 100 people were told what they were receiving in a randomised trial, and 100 people were not, 10 more would take part n the group who knew. There is some uncertainty though: it could be as few as 7 more per hundred, or as many as 13 more. 
2. Phoning people who do not respond to a postal invitation to take part is also effective. Our best estimate is that if investigators called 100 people who did not respond to a postal invitation, and did not call 100 others, 6 more would take part in the trial among the group who received a call. However, this number could be as few as 3 more per hundred, or as many as 9 more. 
3. Using a tailored, user‐testing approach to develop participant information leaflets did not make much difference. The researchers who tested this method spent a lot of time working with people like those to be recruited to decide what should be in the participant information leaflet and what it should look like. Our best estimate is that if 100 people got the new leaflet, 1 more would take part in the trial compared to 100 who got the old leaflet. However, there is some uncertainty, and it could be 1 fewer (i.e. worse than the old leaflet) per hundred, or as many as 3 more. 
We had moderate certainty in what we found for eight other comparisons; our confidence was reduced for most of these because the method had been tested in only one study. We had much less confidence in the other 61 comparisons because the studies had design flaws, were the only studies to look at a particular method, had a very uncertain result or were mock trials rather than real ones. 
Study characteristics 
The 68 included studies covered a very wide range of disease areas, including antenatal care, cancer, home safety, hypertension, podiatry, smoking cessation and surgery. Primary, secondary and community care were included. The size of the studies ranged from 15 to 14,467 participants. Studies came from 12 countries; there was also one multinational study involving 19 countries. The USA and UK dominated with 25 and 22 studies, respectively. The next largest contribution came from Australia with eight studies. 
The small print 
Our search updated our 2010 review and is current to February 2015. We also identified six studies published after 2015 outside the search. The review includes 24 mock trials where the researchers asked people about whether they would take part in an imaginary trial. We have not presented or discussed their results because it is hard to see how the findings relate to real trial decisions. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
What Methods Help Get More People to Join Medical Studies?

## Rationale

**What is the problem?**

Medical studies need people to join them. These people are called participants. But finding enough people to join studies can be hard. When studies cannot find enough people, it may take longer to learn if new treatments work.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Study teams try many different ways to get more people to join. But they do not always know which ways work best. Researchers wanted to find out which methods really help get more people to join medical studies.

**Why is this important?**

If study teams know which methods work, they can use their time and money wisely. This means studies can finish faster. Patients can get better treatments sooner.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers answer this question?**

Researchers looked at 68 studies. These studies tested 72 different ways to get people to join medical studies. The studies included more than 74,000 people.

**What types of studies did they look at?**

The studies covered many health problems. These included care for pregnant women, cancer, home safety, high blood pressure, foot care, help to stop smoking, and surgery. The studies took place in hospitals, clinics, and community settings.

**Where did the studies come from?**

Studies came from 12 countries around the world. Most studies came from the United States (25 studies) and the United Kingdom (22 studies). Australia had 8 studies. One study included 19 different countries.

**How big were the studies?**

The studies had different sizes. The smallest had 15 people. The largest had 14,467 people.

## Results

**What did researchers find?**

Researchers were very sure about three methods:

**Method 1: Tell people what treatment they will get**

When people know what treatment they will receive in a study, more people join. Out of 100 people, about 10 more will join if they know what they will get. This number could be as low as 7 more people or as high as 13 more people.

**Method 2: Call people who do not respond to letters**

When study teams call people who did not answer a letter, more people join. Out of 100 people who get a phone call, about 6 more will join. This number could be as low as 3 more people or as high as 9 more people.

**Method 3: Make better information sheets**

Some study teams spent a lot of time making new information sheets. They worked with people to decide what to include and how it should look. But this did not help much. Out of 100 people who got the new sheet, only 1 more person joined. This number could be 1 fewer person or as many as 3 more people.

**What about other methods?**

Researchers looked at 69 other methods. But they were less sure about whether these methods work. Most methods were tested in only one study. Some studies had problems with how they were done. More research is needed to know if these methods work.

**What does this mean?**

Study teams now know two good ways to get more people to join studies. They can tell people what treatment they will get. They can also call people who do not answer letters. Making fancy information sheets does not seem to help much.

**What is still needed?**

Most methods have been tested only once. More studies are needed to know which other methods work well."

Our question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effects of new monitoring strategies on monitoring findings, participant recruitment, participant follow‐up, and resource use in clinical trials. We also summarized the different components of tested strategies and qualitative evidence from process evaluations. 
Background 
Monitoring a clinical trial is important to ensure the safety of participants and the reliability of results. New methods have been developed for monitoring practices but further assessments of these new methods are needed to see if they do improve effectiveness without being inferior to established methods in terms of patient rights and safety, and quality assurance of trial results. We reviewed studies that examined this question within clinical trials, i.e. studies comparing different monitoring strategies used in clinical trials. 
Study characteristics 
We included eight studies which covered a variety of monitoring strategies in a wide range of clinical trials, including national and large international trials. They included primary (general), secondary (specialized), and tertiary (highly specialized) health care. The size of the studies ranged from 32 to 4371 participants at one to 196 sites. 
Key results 
We identified five comparisons. The first comparison of risk‐based monitoring versus extensive on‐site monitoring found no evidence that the risk‐based approach is inferior to extensive on‐site monitoring in terms of the proportion of participants with a critical or major monitoring finding not identified by the corresponding method, while resource use was three‐ to five‐fold higher with extensive on‐site monitoring. For the second comparison of central statistical monitoring with triggered on‐site visits versus regular (untriggered) on‐site visits, we found some evidence that central statistical monitoring can identify sites in need of support by an on‐site monitoring intervention. In the third comparison, the evaluation of adding an on‐site visit to local and central monitoring revealed a high percentage of participants with major or critical monitoring findings in the on‐site visit group, but low numbers of absolute monitoring findings in both groups. This means that without on‐site visits, some monitoring findings will be missed, but none of the missed findings had any serious impact on patient safety or the validity of the trial's results. In the fourth comparison, two studies assessed new source data verification processes, which are used to check that data recorded within the trial Case Report Form (CRF) match the primary source data (e.g. medical records), and reported little difference to full source data verification processes for the targeted as well as for the remote approach. In the fifth comparison, one study showed no difference in participant recruitment and participant follow‐up between a monitoring approach with systematic initiation visits versus an approach with initiation visits upon request by study sites. 
Certainty of evidence 
We are moderately certain that risk‐based monitoring is not inferior to extensive on‐site monitoring with respect to critical and major monitoring findings in clinical trials. For the remaining body of evidence, there is low or very low certainty in results due to imprecision, small number of studies, or high risk of bias. Ideally, for each of the five identified comparisons, more high‐quality monitoring studies that measure effects on all outcomes specified in this review are necessary to draw more reliable conclusions. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing New Ways to Check on Clinical Trials

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Ways to Check That Clinical Trials Are Done Safely and Correctly

## Rationale

### What is trial monitoring and why does it matter?
When researchers test new treatments in clinical trials, they need to check that everything is done correctly. This checking process is called monitoring. Monitoring helps keep patients safe and makes sure the trial results can be trusted.

### Why was this study needed?
Researchers have created new ways to monitor clinical trials. These new methods might work just as well as old methods but use less time and money. However, we need to know if these new methods really work before using them widely.

### What did researchers want to find out?
The researchers wanted to see if new monitoring methods work as well as traditional methods. They looked at whether new methods could find problems in trials, help recruit patients, keep patients in studies, and save resources.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was a review study. Researchers looked at eight different studies that tested monitoring methods. They did not do new experiments. Instead, they gathered information from studies that already happened.

### What types of studies were reviewed?
The review included studies from many types of health care settings. Some were small local trials. Others were large trials across many countries. The studies ranged from 32 to 4,371 patients. They took place at 1 to 196 different locations.

### What monitoring methods were compared?
Researchers compared five different approaches:
- Risk-based monitoring versus extensive on-site monitoring
- Central computer monitoring versus regular on-site visits
- Adding on-site visits to other monitoring methods
- New ways to check data versus full data checking
- Systematic start-up visits versus visits only when requested

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

**Risk-based monitoring works well and costs less**
Risk-based monitoring focuses on the most important safety issues. This method found problems just as well as extensive on-site monitoring. However, extensive on-site monitoring used three to five times more resources. This means risk-based monitoring can save time and money without missing important problems.

**Computer monitoring can find sites that need help**
Central computer monitoring can spot trial sites that may have problems. These sites can then get extra support through on-site visits.

**On-site visits find some extra problems**
When researchers added on-site visits to other monitoring methods, they found more problems. However, the missed problems were not serious. None of the missed findings put patients at risk or changed the trial results.

**Different data checking methods work similarly**
New ways to check data worked about the same as checking all data completely. This was true for both targeted checking and remote checking methods.

**Different start-up visit approaches work the same**
Having systematic start-up visits worked the same as only visiting when sites asked for help. Both methods recruited and kept the same number of patients.

### How certain are these findings?
Researchers are fairly confident that risk-based monitoring works as well as extensive on-site monitoring. For the other findings, they are less certain. More studies are needed to be sure about these results.

### What does this mean?
New monitoring methods, especially risk-based monitoring, can work well while using fewer resources. This is good news because it means trials can be monitored effectively without spending as much time and money. However, more research is needed to confirm findings about other monitoring methods."
