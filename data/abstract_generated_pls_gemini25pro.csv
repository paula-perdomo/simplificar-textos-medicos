People with neuromuscular disorders may have a weak, ineffective cough predisposing them to respiratory complications. Cough augmentation techniques aim to improve cough effectiveness and mucous clearance, reduce the frequency and duration of respiratory infections requiring hospital admission, and improve quality of life. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy and safety of cough augmentation techniques in adults and children with chronic neuromuscular disorders. 
Search methods
On 13 April 2020, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, and randomised cross‐over trials. 
Selection criteria
We included trials of cough augmentation techniques compared to no treatment, alternative techniques, or combinations thereof, in adults and children with chronic neuromuscular disorders. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. The primary outcomes were the number and duration of unscheduled hospitalisations for acute respiratory exacerbations. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
The review included 11 studies involving 287 adults and children, aged three to 73 years. Inadequately reported cross‐over studies and the limited additional information provided by authors severely restricted the number of analyses that could be performed. 
Studies compared manually assisted cough, mechanical insufflation, manual and mechanical breathstacking, mechanical insufflation‐exsufflation, glossopharyngeal breathing, and combination techniques to unassisted cough and alternative or sham interventions. None of the included studies reported on the primary outcomes of this review (number and duration of unscheduled hospital admissions) or listed 'adverse events' as primary or secondary outcome measures. 
The evidence suggests that a range of cough augmentation techniques may increase peak cough flow compared to unassisted cough (199 participants, 8 RCTs), but the evidence is very uncertain. There may be little to no difference in peak cough flow outcomes between alternative cough augmentation techniques (216 participants, 9 RCTs). 
There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of interventions on measures of gaseous exchange, pulmonary function, quality of life, general function, or participant preference and satisfaction. 
Authors' conclusions
We are very uncertain about the safety and efficacy of cough augmentation techniques in adults and children with chronic neuromuscular disorders and further studies are needed.

### **Plain Title**

Do Ways to Help a Cough Work for People with Muscle and Nerve Problems? A Summary of Past Studies.

### **Rationale**

Some people have long-term conditions that make their muscles and nerves weak. This can affect the muscles we use to breathe and cough. When a person cannot cough strongly, it is hard to clear out germs and mucus from their lungs.

This can cause serious problems. People with a weak cough may get lung infections more often. They may need to go to the hospital to get better. This can happen over and over again.

There are special ways to help people cough better. These are called “cough-helping methods.” They include using special machines or hands-on help to make a cough stronger. The main idea is that a stronger cough can clear the lungs. This could mean fewer lung infections and fewer trips to the hospital.

The researchers in this study wanted to see if these methods really work. They also wanted to know if they are safe to use. They looked at past studies to bring all the information together and find answers.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with patients. Instead, the researchers looked for all the past studies that had already been done on this topic. This is called a review. A review helps us see what all the research says when we look at it together.

The researchers looked for studies that compared a cough-helping method to no help at all. They also looked at studies that compared one method to another.

The studies they found included 287 people in total. This group included both children and adults with muscle and nerve problems. Their ages were from 3 to 73 years old. The information in the studies did not say how long each person took part in the research.

### **Results**

The researchers found 11 studies to review. After looking at them closely, they found there was not enough good information to answer the main questions.

The most important goal was to see if cough-helping methods helped people stay out of the hospital. The researchers wanted to know if people had fewer or shorter hospital stays for lung problems. But none of the 11 studies they found had looked at this. The studies also did not report on any bad side effects from the methods. This means we still do not know if these methods are safe or if they keep people healthier.

Some studies did look at how strong a person’s cough was. They found that the cough-helping methods might make a cough stronger than no help. But the researchers were ""very uncertain"" about this. This means the proof from the studies was not very strong. There also was not much difference seen when comparing one method to another.

The studies did not have enough information to tell us if these methods helped with other things. For example, we do not know if they made breathing easier, made lungs work better, or helped people feel better in their daily lives.

Based on this review, the researchers concluded that we are very unsure if cough-helping methods work well or are safe. More and better studies are needed to learn if these methods can truly help adults and children with muscle and nerve problems.","The safety and effectiveness of techniques to assist coughing in people with chronic neuromuscular disorders 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of techniques used to assist coughing in people with chronic neuromuscular disorders (cough augmentation techniques). 
Background 
People with neuromuscular disorders (nerve‐related conditions that affect the muscles) may have difficulty coughing and clearing mucous from the airways, placing them at risk of choking, recurrent chest infections, and ongoing lung disease. Cough augmentation techniques, such as manually assisted cough, bagging (using a self‐inflating bag commonly used for resuscitation), mechanical Cough Assist (a device that clears secretions by applying a positive pressure to the airway, then rapidly shifting to a negative pressure), 'frog' breathing (a method of breathing to help a person take in a bigger volume of air), and breathstacking (the person takes a number of sequential breaths in, stacking one breath on top of the other without breathing out in between breaths) aim to improve cough effectiveness, with the eventual aim of reducing the number or severity (or both) of chest infections, and improving the ability of people to perform daily activities (functional ability) and quality of life. 
Methods 
We carried out a wide database search for studies of cough augmentation techniques in adults and children with chronic neuromuscular disorders. We selected studies that assigned people to the treatment(s) or treatment order by chance, as this study type provides the best evidence. 
Results and quality of the evidence 
We found 11 studies with 287 people and several cough augmentation techniques. One study measured the long‐term effects of treatment, but was only published as an abstract without enough information to accurately analyse the study findings. Many included studies had problems with how they were performed, how their findings were reported, or both, which made it difficult to fully interpret their results. None of the studies reported on the outcomes we thought were the most important for making decisions about the effectiveness and safety of cough augmentation techniques. For example, the studies did not report on the number or duration of unscheduled hospital admissions for chest infections, survival, functional ability, or quality of life. The safety of cough augmentation techniques could not be determined. Some studies suggested that cough augmentation techniques may be better than an unassisted cough, but the results are very uncertain. There was not enough evidence to show that any one technique was better than another in improving cough effort. 
Conclusions and recommendation 
The findings of this review provided insufficient information to make decisions about when and how to use cough augmentation techniques in people with chronic neuromuscular disorders. There is currently very low certainty evidence for or against the safety and effectiveness of cough augmentation techniques in people with chronic neuromuscular diseases and more studies are needed. 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to 13 April 2020.

How Team-Based Care Helps People Recover from a Hip or Knee Replacement

### **Rationale**

Some people have long-term joint disease. This can cause severe pain in their hip or knee that does not go away. It can make it very hard to walk, climb stairs, or do daily tasks. When other treatments no longer work, doctors may suggest joint replacement surgery. In this surgery, a doctor replaces the damaged joint with a new, artificial one.

After the surgery, patients need care to help them heal and move again. This care is called rehabilitation, or rehab. Rehab helps people get their strength back and learn to use their new joint. Sometimes, a whole team of health experts works together to give this care. This team may include doctors, nurses, and physical therapists. This is called team-based rehab.

We wanted to know if this team-based rehab helps people get better after surgery. We also wanted to see if the place where people get rehab matters. For example, is it better to get rehab in the hospital or at home? This review of past studies was done to find answers to these questions.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, our team looked at the results of other studies that were already done. We searched for studies about team-based rehab after hip or knee surgery.

We found 5 studies to review. In total, these studies included 619 people. All of these people had surgery to replace a hip or a knee.

The studies we found looked at two different places for rehab:
*   **In the hospital:** Two studies looked at care that started right after surgery while patients were still in the hospital.
*   **At home:** Three studies looked at care given by a health team at a person’s home after they left the hospital.

The studies followed patients for up to 6 months to see how they were doing. We did not find any studies that looked at rehab given at a clinic.

### **Results**

Our review found that the studies were not of the best quality. This makes it hard to be completely sure about the results. The studies were also very different from each other. This means we could not combine all their results to get one single, strong answer.

However, the studies did show some good signs that team-based rehab helps.

For people who got rehab in the hospital, starting the care early was helpful. An expert care team helped them reach their movement goals faster. This means they could stand up, walk, and care for themselves sooner. They also spent less time in the hospital and had fewer problems after surgery. This also helped lower the cost of their care in the first few months.

For people who got team-based care at home, there were also good results. After 6 months, they were able to move better. They also said they felt better and had a better quality of life.

In conclusion, our review found some proof that early rehab from a care team is good for patients. It seems to help people move better and feel better after a hip or knee replacement. But, because the studies were of low quality, we need more and better research to be sure. Future studies should be well-designed. This will help doctors and patients understand the best way to give rehab care, like how often it should be done and for how long.","Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes following joint replacement at the hip and knee in chronic arthropathy

10.1002-14651858.CD013717.pub2,"Background
In late 2019, the first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) were reported in Wuhan, China, followed by a worldwide spread. Numerous countries have implemented control measures related to international travel, including border closures, travel restrictions, screening at borders, and quarantine of travellers. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of international travel‐related control measures during the COVID‐19 pandemic on infectious disease transmission and screening‐related outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, Embase and COVID‐19‐specific databases, including the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and the WHO Global Database on COVID‐19 Research to 13 November 2020. 
Selection criteria
We considered experimental, quasi‐experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of travel‐related control measures affecting human travel across international borders during the COVID‐19 pandemic. In the original review, we also considered evidence on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In this version we decided to focus on COVID‐19 evidence only. Primary outcome categories were (i) cases avoided, (ii) cases detected, and (iii) a shift in epidemic development. Secondary outcomes were other infectious disease transmission outcomes, healthcare utilisation, resource requirements and adverse effects if identified in studies assessing at least one primary outcome. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and subsequently full texts. For studies included in the analysis, one review author extracted data and appraised the study. At least one additional review author checked for correctness of data. To assess the risk of bias and quality of included studies, we used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS‐2) tool for observational studies concerned with screening, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. One review author assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE, and several review authors discussed these GRADE judgements. 
Main results
Overall, we included 62 unique studies in the analysis; 49 were modelling studies and 13 were observational studies. Studies covered a variety of settings and levels of community transmission. 
Most studies compared travel‐related control measures against a counterfactual scenario in which the measure was not implemented. However, some modelling studies described additional comparator scenarios, such as different levels of stringency of the measures (including relaxation of restrictions), or a combination of measures. 
Concerns with the quality of modelling studies related to potentially inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters, and an inadequate assessment of model uncertainty. Concerns with risk of bias in observational studies related to the selection of travellers and the reference test, and unclear reporting of certain methodological aspects. 
Below we outline the results for each intervention category by illustrating the findings from selected outcomes. 
Travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross‐border travel (31 modelling studies) 
The studies assessed cases avoided and shift in epidemic development. We found very low‐certainty evidence for a reduction in COVID‐19 cases in the community (13 studies) and cases exported or imported (9 studies). Most studies reported positive effects, with effect sizes varying widely; only a few studies showed no effect. 
There was very low‐certainty evidence that cross‐border travel controls can slow the spread of COVID‐19. Most studies predicted positive effects, however, results from individual studies varied from a delay of less than one day to a delay of 85 days; very few studies predicted no effect of the measure. 
Screening at borders (13 modelling studies; 13 observational studies) 
Screening measures covered symptom/exposure‐based screening or test‐based screening (commonly specifying polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing), or both, before departure or upon or within a few days of arrival. Studies assessed cases avoided, shift in epidemic development and cases detected. Studies generally predicted or observed some benefit from screening at borders, however these varied widely. 
For symptom/exposure‐based screening, one modelling study reported that global implementation of screening measures would reduce the number of cases exported per day from another country by 82% (95% confidence interval (CI) 72% to 95%) (moderate‐certainty evidence). Four modelling studies predicted delays in epidemic development, although there was wide variation in the results between the studies (very low‐certainty evidence). Four modelling studies predicted that the proportion of cases detected would range from 1% to 53% (very low‐certainty evidence). Nine observational studies observed the detected proportion to range from 0% to 100% (very low‐certainty evidence), although all but one study observed this proportion to be less than 54%. 
For test‐based screening, one modelling study provided very low‐certainty evidence for the number of cases avoided. It reported that testing travellers reduced imported or exported cases as well as secondary cases. Five observational studies observed that the proportion of cases detected varied from 58% to 90% (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Quarantine (12 modelling studies) 
The studies assessed cases avoided, shift in epidemic development and cases detected. All studies suggested some benefit of quarantine, however the magnitude of the effect ranged from small to large across the different outcomes (very low‐ to low‐certainty evidence). Three modelling studies predicted that the reduction in the number of cases in the community ranged from 450 to over 64,000 fewer cases (very low‐certainty evidence). The variation in effect was possibly related to the duration of quarantine and compliance. 
Quarantine and screening at borders (7 modelling studies; 4 observational studies) 
The studies assessed shift in epidemic development and cases detected. Most studies predicted positive effects for the combined measures with varying magnitudes (very low‐ to low‐certainty evidence). Four observational studies observed that the proportion of cases detected for quarantine and screening at borders ranged from 68% to 92% (low‐certainty evidence). The variation may depend on how the measures were combined, including the length of the quarantine period and days when the test was conducted in quarantine. 
Authors' conclusions
With much of the evidence derived from modelling studies, notably for travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross‐border travel and quarantine of travellers, there is a lack of 'real‐world' evidence. The certainty of the evidence for most travel‐related control measures and outcomes is very low and the true effects are likely to be substantially different from those reported here. Broadly, travel restrictions may limit the spread of disease across national borders. Symptom/exposure‐based screening measures at borders on their own are likely not effective; PCR testing at borders as a screening measure likely detects more cases than symptom/exposure‐based screening at borders, although if performed only upon arrival this will likely also miss a meaningful proportion of cases. Quarantine, based on a sufficiently long quarantine period and high compliance is likely to largely avoid further transmission from travellers. Combining quarantine with PCR testing at borders will likely improve effectiveness. Many studies suggest that effects depend on factors, such as levels of community transmission, travel volumes and duration, other public health measures in place, and the exact specification and timing of the measure. Future research should be better reported, employ a range of designs beyond modelling and assess potential benefits and harms of the travel‐related control measures from a societal perspective.

Do Rules for Travelers Help Stop the Spread of COVID-19?

**Rationale**
COVID-19 is a sickness that started in late 2019. It spread quickly all over the world. Many people got sick, which was a big problem for everyone.

To try and slow the sickness, many countries made new rules for people traveling. Some countries closed their borders to stop people from coming in. Other countries checked travelers for signs of sickness when they arrived. Some places made travelers stay away from other people for a time. This is called quarantine.

Researchers wanted to know if these travel rules actually worked. They looked at many studies to see how well the rules stopped the sickness from spreading. Learning what worked best can help us get ready for future health problems.

**Trial Design**
This was not a study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked for and studied other research that was already finished. This kind of study is called a review.

The researchers found 62 different studies to look at. Most of these studies used computers to guess what might happen with different travel rules. These are called modeling studies. Other studies watched what happened in real life when travel rules were used. These are called observational studies.

All the studies were about rules for people who were traveling between countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. The researchers wanted to see if the rules helped to lower the number of sick people or slow down the spread of the virus.

**Results**
The researchers said we cannot be very sure about many of the results. This is because most of the proof came from computer guesses, not from real-world events. The real effects of these rules could be very different from what the studies found.

Here is what the studies suggested about each type of travel rule:

**Stopping or Limiting Travel**
*   Closing borders or limiting the number of travelers may have helped slow the spread of COVID-19.
*   These rules may have led to fewer sick people in a country.
*   But the results were very different from one study to the next. Some studies showed the rules helped a lot, while others showed they helped only a little.

**Checking Travelers at the Border**
*   Just checking people for symptoms, like a fever, did not seem to work well. This method missed many people who had the virus but did not feel sick.
*   Using a lab test, like a nose swab, to check for the virus worked better. These tests found more sick people than just checking for symptoms.
*   But even lab tests at the border missed some sick people. A person could be tested too early and get sick a few days later.

**Making Travelers Quarantine**
*   Making travelers stay away from other people for a set time seemed to help a lot.
*   This rule helped stop people who were sick from spreading the virus to others after they arrived.
*   Quarantine worked best when it was for a long enough time, like 10 or 14 days. It also worked best when people followed the rules carefully.

**Using Quarantine and Testing Together**
*   The best results seemed to come from using both rules together.
*   Having travelers quarantine and also take a lab test was a good way to find people with the virus.
*   This plan likely stopped the spread of the virus better than using just one of the rules alone.

**What the Researchers Concluded**
Travel rules can help slow down a sickness like COVID-19. But no single rule is perfect. A mix of rules, like quarantine and testing, seems to work best. The researchers also said we need more studies that look at what happens in the real world. This will help us be more sure about how well these rules work.","Can international travel‐related control measures contain the spread of the COVID‐19 pandemic? 
What are international travel‐related control measures? 
International travel control measures are methods to manage international travel to contain the spread of COVID‐19. Measures include: 
‐ closing international borders to stop travellers crossing from one country to another;
‐ restricting travel to and from certain countries, particularly those with high infection levels; 
‐ screening or testing travellers entering or leaving a country if they have symptoms or have been in contact with an infected person; 
‐ quarantining newly‐arrived travellers from another country, that is, requiring travellers to stay at home or in a specific place for a certain time. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out how effective international travel‐related control measures are in containing the COVID‐19 pandemic. 
What we did 
We searched for studies on the effects of these measures on the spread of COVID‐19. Studies had to report how many cases these measures prevented or detected, or whether they changed the course of the pandemic. The studies could include people of any age, anywhere. They could be of any design including those that used ‘real‐life’ data (observational studies) or hypothetical data from computer‐generated simulations (modelling studies). 
This is the first update of our review. This update includes only studies on COVID‐19, published up to 13 November 2020. 
What we found 
We found 62 studies. Most (49 studies) were modelling studies; only 13 used real‐life data (observational studies). Studies took place across the world and at different times during the pandemic. Levels of COVID‐19 within countries varied. 
Most studies compared current travel‐related control measures with no travel‐related controls. However, some modelling studies also compared current measures against possible measures, for example, to see what might happen if controls were more or less relaxed or were combined with other measures. 
Main results 
Below we summarise the findings of some outcomes.
Travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross‐border travel (31 modelling studies) 
Most studies showed that travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross‐border travel were beneficial, but this beneficial effect ranged from small to large. Additionally, some studies found no effect. Studies also predicted that these restrictions would delay the outbreak, but the delay ranged from one day to 85 days in different studies. 
Screening at borders (13 modelling studies and 13 observational studies) 
These studies assessed screening at borders, including screening people with symptoms or who had potentially been exposed to COVID‐19, or testing people, before or after they travelled. 
For screening based on symptoms or potential exposure to COVID‐19, modelling studies found that screening reduced imported or exported cases and delayed outbreaks. Modelling studies predicted that 1% to 53% of cases would be detected. Observational studies reported a wide range of cases detected, from 0% to 100%, with the majority of studies reporting less than 54% of cases detected. 
For screening based on testing, studies reported that testing travellers reduced imported or exported cases, and cases detected. Observational studies reported that the proportion of cases detected varied from 58% to 90%. This variation might be due to the timing of testing. 
Quarantine (12 modelling studies) 
All studies suggested that quarantine may be beneficial, but the size of this effect ranged from small to large in the different studies. Modelling studies, for example, predicted that quarantine could lead to between 450 and over 64,000 fewer cases in the community. Differences in effects may depend on how long people were quarantined for and how well they followed the rules. 
Quarantine and screening at borders (7 modelling studies and 4 observational studies) 
For quarantine and screening at borders, most studies suggested some benefit, however the size of this effect differed between studies. For example, observational studies reported that between 68% and 92% of cases would be detected. Differences in effects may depend on how long people were quarantined for and how often they were tested while in quarantine. 
How reliable are these results? 
Our confidence in these results is limited. Most studies were based on mathematical predictions (modelling), so we lack real‐life evidence. Further, we were not confident that models used correct assumptions, so our confidence in the evidence on travel restrictions and quarantine, in particular, is very low. Some studies were published quickly online as ‘preprints’. Preprints do not undergo the normal rigorous checks of published studies, so we are not certain how reliable they are. Also, the studies were very different from each other and their results varied according to the specification of each travel measure (e.g. the type of screening approach), how it was put into practice and enforced, the amount of cross‐border travel, levels of community transmission and other types of national measures to control the pandemic. 
What this means 
Overall, international travel‐related control measures may help to limit the spread of COVID‐19 across national borders. Restricting cross‐border travel can be a helpful measure. Screening travellers only for symptoms at borders is likely to miss many cases; testing may be more effective but may also miss cases if only performed upon arrival. Quarantine that lasts at least 10 days can prevent travellers spreading COVID‐19 and may be more effective if combined with another measure such as testing, especially if people follow the rules. 
Future research needs to be better reported. More studies should focus on real‐life evidence, and should assess potential benefits and risks of travel‐related control measures to individuals and society as a whole.

10.1002-14651858.CD013384.pub2,"Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by shortness of breath, cough and recurrent exacerbations. People with COPD often live with one or more co‐existing long‐term health conditions (comorbidities). People with more severe COPD often have a higher number of comorbidities, putting them at greater risk of morbidity and mortality. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of any single intervention for COPD adapted or tailored to their comorbidity(s) compared to any other intervention for people with COPD and one or more common comorbidities (quantitative data, RCTs) in terms of the following outcomes: Quality of life, exacerbations, functional status, all‐cause and respiratory‐related hospital admissions, mortality, pain, and depression and anxiety. 
To assess the effectiveness of an adapted or tailored single COPD intervention (simple or complex) that is aimed at changing the management of people with COPD and one or more common comorbidities (quantitative data, RCTs) compared to usual care in terms of the following outcomes: Quality of life, exacerbations, functional status, all‐cause and respiratory‐related hospital admissions, mortality, pain, and depression and anxiety. 
To identify emerging themes that describe the views and experiences of patients, carers and healthcare professionals when receiving or providing care to manage multimorbidities (qualitative data). 
Search methods
We searched multiple databases including the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL, to identify relevant randomised and qualitative studies. We also searched trial registries and conducted citation searches. The latest search was conducted in January 2021. 
Selection criteria
Eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) compared a) any single intervention for COPD adapted or tailored to their comorbidity(s) compared to any other intervention, or b) any adapted or tailored single COPD intervention (simple or complex) that is aimed at changing the management of people with COPD and one or more comorbidities, compared to usual care. We included qualitative studies or mixed‐methods studies to identify themes. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods for analysis of the RCTs. We used Cochrane's risk of bias tool for the RCTs and the CASP checklist for the qualitative studies. We planned to use the Mixed Methods Appraisal tool (MMAT) to assess the risk of bias in mixed‐methods studies, but we found none. We used GRADE and CERQual to assess the quality of the quantitative and qualitative evidence respectively. The primary outcome measures for this review were quality of life and exacerbations. 
Main results
Quantitative studies 
We included seven studies (1197 participants) in the quantitative analyses, with interventions including telemonitoring, pulmonary rehabilitation, treatment optimisation, water‐based exercise training and case management. Interventions were either compared with usual care or with an active comparator (such as land‐based exercise training). Duration of trials ranged from 4 to 52 weeks. Mean age of participants ranged from 64 to 72 years and COPD severity ranged from mild to very severe. Trials included either people with COPD and a specific comorbidity (including cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, lung cancer, head or neck cancer, and musculoskeletal conditions), or with one or more comorbidities of any type. 
Overall, we judged the evidence presented to be of moderate to very low certainty (GRADE), mainly due to the methodological quality of included trials and imprecision of effect estimates. 
Intervention versus usual care 
Quality of life as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score may improve with tailored pulmonary rehabilitation compared to usual care at 52 weeks (mean difference (MD) −10.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) −12.66 to −9.04; 1 study, 70 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Tailored pulmonary rehabilitation is likely to improve COPD assessment test (CAT) scores compared with usual care at 52 weeks (MD −8.02, 95% CI −9.44 to −6.60; 1 study, 70 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) and with a multicomponent telehealth intervention at 52 weeks (MD −6.90, 95% CI −9.56 to −4.24; moderate‐certainty evidence). Evidence is uncertain about effects of pharmacotherapy optimisation or telemonitoring interventions on CAT improvement compared with usual care. 
There may be little to no difference in the number of people experiencing exacerbations, or mean exacerbations with case management compared with usual care (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.57; 1 study, 470 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
For secondary outcomes, six‐minute walk distance (6MWD) may improve with pulmonary rehabilitation, water‐based exercise or multicomponent interventions at 38 to 52 weeks (low‐certainty evidence). A multicomponent intervention may result in fewer people being admitted to hospital at 17 weeks, although there may be little to no difference in a telemonitoring intervention. There may be little to no difference between intervention and usual care for mortality. 
Intervention versus active comparator 
We included one study comparing water‐based and land‐based exercise (30 participants). We found no evidence for quality of life or exacerbations. 
There may be little to no difference between water‐ and land‐based exercise for 6MWD (MD 5 metres, 95% CI −22 to 32; 38 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Qualitative studies 
One nested qualitative study (21 participants) explored perceptions and experiences of people with COPD and long‐term conditions, and of researchers and health professionals who were involved in an RCT of telemonitoring equipment. 
Several themes were identified, including health status, beliefs and concerns, reliability of equipment, self‐efficacy, perceived ease of use, factors affecting usefulness and perceived usefulness, attitudes and intention, self‐management and changes in healthcare use. We judged the qualitative evidence presented as of very low certainty overall. 
Authors' conclusions
Owing to a paucity of eligible trials, as well as diversity in the intervention type, comorbidities and the outcome measures reported, we were unable to provide a robust synthesis of data. Pulmonary rehabilitation or multicomponent interventions may improve quality of life and functional status (6MWD), but the evidence is too limited to draw a robust conclusion. The key take‐home message from this review is the lack of data from RCTs on treatments for people living with COPD and comorbidities. 
Given the variation in number and type of comorbidity(s) an individual may have, and severity of COPD, larger studies reporting individual patient data are required to determine these effects.

Does Special Care Help People with a Lung Disease and Other Health Problems?

### **Rationale**

A lung disease called COPD makes it hard to breathe. COPD stands for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. People with this lung disease often have a cough and shortness of breath. They can also have flare-ups where their breathing gets much worse.

Many people with this lung disease also have other long-term health problems. These can be things like heart problems or joint pain. Having more than one health problem can make people sicker. It can put them at a higher risk of needing to go to the hospital.

Doctors want to know if changing the care for the lung disease to also help with the other health problems works better. This study looked at past research. The goal was to find the best ways to treat people who have the lung disease and other health issues at the same time.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers looked for all the studies that were already done on this topic. They looked for two types of studies. The first type tested different treatments. The second type asked people about their thoughts and feelings on the treatments.

The researchers found seven studies to look at closely. These studies included about 1200 people in total. The people in the studies were between 64 and 72 years old. They all had the lung disease called COPD. Their lung disease ranged from mild to very severe. They also had at least one other long-term health problem.

The studies looked at different types of special care. These included check-ins by phone, special exercise programs, and better medicine plans. The studies lasted from about one month to one year.

### **Results**

The researchers found that there were not many studies to look at. The studies they did find were very different from each other. This made it hard to compare them and be sure about the results.

One study showed that a special exercise and education program may help people feel better. It may also help lessen their breathing problems compared to regular care. This program is for people with lung disease. Some treatments, like the exercise programs, may help people walk farther. Other treatments, like phone check-ins, did not show a clear benefit.

One small study compared exercise in water to exercise on land. It found no real difference between them for helping people with their breathing.

Researchers also looked at one study where people shared their thoughts. The people talked about their health and their worries. They also talked about the tools used to track their health at home, and if they were easy to use.

The most important finding was that more research is needed. There are not enough good studies on this topic. Because people can have many different health problems, it is hard to know what works best. We need bigger and better studies. This will help us learn how to best care for people with this lung disease and other health problems.","Approaches to help people with COPD who have one or more long‐term conditions
What is COPD and comorbidity? 
COPD is a common condition caused mainly by smoking and can lead to long‐term breathing problems. Symptoms include shortness of breath, and cough with sputum production due to airways and lung damage. People with COPD may have one or more other long‐term conditions (comorbidities) such as heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, asthma and lung cancer which can lead to poor health. People living with two or more comorbidities can also be known as living with multimorbidity. 
Why did we do this review?  
Because many people with COPD live with multimorbidity, naturally people in clinical trials will have multimorbidities. However, the results of those trials are usually not reported broken down by multimorbidity. People with comorbidities may need to adapt interventions to take account of their comorbidity — for example taking exercise in water instead of on land so that their bodies are better supported. Historically, Cochrane Airways Reviews have not taken into account people's comorbidities, and this review is a first step to addressing this. We decided to complete a review that centres on people with COPD and comorbidities following a meeting with our COPD patient group, who highlighted concerns over comorbidities. After some deliberation, we decided to include the following two sorts of trials. 
1. Any single intervention for COPD delivered to people with COPD adapted to or targeting their comorbidity compared to routine care or any other intervention. 
2. Any intervention aimed at changing the management of people with COPD and comorbidities, which could be simple (e.g. scheduling COPD and heart clinics on the same day) or more complex (e.g. developing a new care package for management of people with COPD across a local health service), compared to routine care. 
We wanted to know which treatments improve quality of life and reduce exacerbations for people living with COPD and one or more comorbidities. 
We also wanted to find out about how people with COPD, carers and health professionals felt about those treatments. 
What information did we find? 
We carried out a search for studies in January 2021. We found seven  eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including 1197 people, and one qualitative study which was part of one of the randomised trials and provided information about people's opinions and experiences of using telehealth equipment. People included in the trials were aged between 64 and 72 years, and their COPD severity ranged from mild to very severe. The trials either included people with COPD and a specific comorbidity such as cardiovascular disease or lung cancer, or they included people with COPD and one or more other conditions of any sort. 
Results and conclusions 
There is not enough evidence on people with COPD and other comorbidities to draw firm conclusions about interventions aimed at COPD that are adapted for the comorbidity. The available evidence indicated the following:  
‐ Quality of life as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score may improve with tailored pulmonary rehabilitation compared to usual care (note that there is a strong evidence base for pulmonary rehabilitation in people with COPD). 
‐ Pulmonary rehabilitation is likely to improve quality of life as measured by the COPD assessment test (CAT) scores compared with usual care at 52 weeks and with a multicomponent telehealth intervention.  
‐ Evidence is uncertain about the effects of pharmacotherapy optimisation or telemonitoring interventions on CAT improvement compared with usual care. 
‐ There may be little to no difference in the number of people experiencing exacerbations, or mean exacerbations with case management compared with usual care.  
‐ For secondary outcomes, the distance walked by participants in six minutes may improve with pulmonary rehabilitation, water‐based exercise or multicomponent interventions. A multicomponent intervention may result in fewer people being admitted to hospital, although there may be little to no difference in a telemonitoring intervention.  
‐ There may be little to no difference between intervention and usual care for deaths across several studies. 
‐ One study compared water‐based exercise with land‐based exercise. We found no evidence for quality of life or exacerbations. There may be little to no difference between water‐ and land‐based exercise on the distance walked by participants in six minutes. 
‐ One qualitative study explored perceptions and experiences of people with COPD and long‐term conditions, and of researchers and health professionals who were involved in an RCT of telemonitoring equipment. Several themes were identified, including health status, beliefs and concerns, reliability of equipment, self‐efficacy, perceived ease of use, factors affecting usefulness and perceived usefulness, attitudes and intention, self‐management and changes in healthcare use.  
Larger studies with more people with COPD and comorbidities could help to find out if targeted approaches can improve health. 
Certainty of the information 
Overall there were very few studies and most studies were small. This means the results are based on a small amount of information. Trials with different interventions and different or more people may give a different result.

10.1002-14651858.CD013674.pub2,"Background
Major depressive disorders have a significant impact on children and adolescents, including on educational and vocational outcomes, interpersonal relationships, and physical and mental health and well‐being. There is an association between major depressive disorder and suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide. Antidepressant medication is used in moderate to severe depression; there is now a range of newer generations of these medications. 
Objectives
To investigate, via network meta‐analysis (NMA), the comparative effectiveness and safety of different newer generation antidepressants in children and adolescents with a diagnosed major depressive disorder (MDD) in terms of depression, functioning, suicide‐related outcomes and other adverse outcomes. The impact of age, treatment duration, baseline severity, and pharmaceutical industry funding was investigated on clinician‐rated depression (CDRS‐R) and suicide‐related outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Specialised Register, the Cochrane Library (Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR)), together with Ovid Embase, MEDLINE and PsycINFO till March 2020. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials of six to 18 year olds of either sex and any ethnicity with clinically diagnosed major depressive disorder were included. Trials that compared the effectiveness of newer generation antidepressants with each other or with a placebo were included. Newer generation antidepressants included: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs); norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors; norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitors; norepinephrine dopamine disinhibitors (NDDIs); and tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs). 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently screened titles/abstracts and full texts, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We analysed dichotomous data as Odds Ratios (ORs), and continuous data as Mean Difference (MD) for the following outcomes: depression symptom severity (clinician rated), response or remission of depression symptoms, depression symptom severity (self‐rated), functioning, suicide related outcomes and overall adverse outcomes. Random‐effects network meta‐analyses were conducted in a frequentist framework using multivariate meta‐analysis. Certainty of evidence was assessed using Confidence in Network Meta‐analysis (CINeMA). We used ""informative statements"" to standardise the interpretation and description of the results. 
Main results
Twenty‐six studies were included. There were no data for the two primary outcomes (depressive disorder established via clinical diagnostic interview and suicide), therefore, the results comprise only secondary outcomes. Most antidepressants may be associated with a ""small and unimportant"" reduction in depression symptoms on the CDRS‐R scale (range 17 to 113) compared with placebo (high certainty evidence: paroxetine: MD ‐1.43, 95% CI ‐3.90, 1.04; vilazodone: MD ‐0.84, 95% CI ‐3.03, 1.35; desvenlafaxine MD ‐0.07, 95% CI ‐3.51, 3.36; moderate certainty evidence: sertraline: MD ‐3.51, 95% CI ‐6.99, ‐0.04; fluoxetine: MD ‐2.84, 95% CI ‐4.12, ‐1.56; escitalopram: MD ‐2.62, 95% CI ‐5.29, 0.04; low certainty evidence: duloxetine: MD ‐2.70, 95% CI ‐5.03, ‐0.37; vortioxetine: MD 0.60, 95% CI ‐2.52, 3.72; very low certainty evidence for comparisons between other antidepressants and placebo). 
There were ""small and unimportant"" differences between most antidepressants in reduction of depression symptoms (high‐ or moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Results were similar across other outcomes of benefit.
In most studies risk of self‐harm or suicide was an exclusion criterion for the study. Proportions of suicide‐related outcomes were low for most included studies and 95% confidence intervals were wide for all comparisons. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of mirtazapine (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.03, 8.04), duloxetine (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.72, 1.82), vilazodone (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.68, 1.48), desvenlafaxine (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.59, 1.52), citalopram (OR 1.72, 95% CI 0.76, 3.87) or vortioxetine (OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.29, 8.60) on suicide‐related outcomes compared with placebo. There is low certainty evidence that escitalopram may ""at least slightly"" reduce odds of suicide‐related outcomes compared with placebo (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.43, 1.84). There is low certainty evidence that fluoxetine (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.87, 1.86), paroxetine (OR 1.81, 95% CI 0.85, 3.86), sertraline (OR 3.03, 95% CI 0.60, 15.22), and venlafaxine (OR 13.84, 95% CI 1.79, 106.90) may ""at least slightly"" increase odds of suicide‐related outcomes compared with placebo. 
There is moderate certainty evidence that venlafaxine probably results in an ""at least slightly"" increased odds of suicide‐related outcomes compared with desvenlafaxine (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01, 0.56) and escitalopram (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01, 0.56). There was very low certainty evidence regarding other comparisons between antidepressants. 
Authors' conclusions
Overall, methodological shortcomings of the randomised trials make it difficult to interpret the findings with regard to the efficacy and safety of newer antidepressant medications. Findings suggest that most newer antidepressants may reduce depression symptoms in a small and unimportant way compared with placebo. Furthermore, there are likely to be small and unimportant differences in the reduction of depression symptoms between the majority of antidepressants. However, our findings reflect the average effects of the antidepressants, and given depression is a heterogeneous condition, some individuals may experience a greater response. Guideline developers and others making recommendations might therefore consider whether a recommendation for the use of newer generation antidepressants is warranted for some individuals in some circumstances. Our findings suggest sertraline, escitalopram, duloxetine, as well as fluoxetine (which is currently the only treatment recommended for first‐line prescribing) could be considered as a first option. 
Children and adolescents considered at risk of suicide were frequently excluded from trials, so that we cannot be confident about the effects of these medications for these individuals. If an antidepressant is being considered for an individual, this should be done in consultation with the child/adolescent and their family/caregivers and it remains critical to ensure close monitoring of treatment effects and suicide‐related outcomes (combined suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) in those treated with newer generation antidepressants, given findings that some of these medications may be associated with greater odds of these events. Consideration of psychotherapy, particularly cognitive behavioural therapy, as per guideline recommendations, remains important.

Comparing Newer Medicines for Depression in Children and Teens

**Rationale**
Serious depression is a health problem that can affect young people. It can make it hard to do well in school or at work later in life. It can also harm friendships and family life. Sometimes, depression is linked to thoughts of suicide.

Doctors often use medicines called antidepressants to treat serious depression. There are many newer types of these medicines. But we do not know enough about which ones work best for children and teens. We also need to know which ones are the safest.

This study was done to compare these newer depression medicines. Researchers wanted to see how well they worked to reduce depression. They also looked at their side effects, especially anything related to suicide. This information can help doctors, patients, and families make better choices about treatment.

**Trial Design**
This was a special type of study called a review. The researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they gathered the results from 26 other studies that were already completed. By combining all this information, they could compare many different medicines at once.

The young people in these past studies were between 6 and 18 years old. They all had been diagnosed with serious depression.

The studies compared different newer depression medicines with each other. They also compared the medicines to a placebo. A placebo is a pill with no medicine in it, like a sugar pill. This helps researchers see if the real medicine is actually working.

**Results**
The study found that most of the newer depression medicines may help reduce the symptoms of depression a little bit. But the researchers noted that this change was small. It might not be big enough to make a real difference in a person’s daily life. When the medicines were compared against each other, there were also only small differences between them.

The researchers also looked at the risk of suicide-related thoughts and actions. This was hard to study. Many of the original studies did not include young people who were already at risk for suicide. This means the results may not apply to everyone.

The proof about suicide risk was not very strong. For some medicines, the results suggest they might slightly increase the risk of suicide-related thoughts compared to a sugar pill. For a few others, they might slightly lower the risk. For most medicines, it was not clear what effect they had. One medicine, called venlafaxine, seemed to have a higher risk of suicide-related thoughts when compared to some of the other medicines.

The researchers who did this review came to a few main conclusions. First, they said it is hard to be sure about these results because the original 26 studies had some weaknesses.

Even so, they suggest that four medicines could be good first choices to try. These are sertraline, escitalopram, duloxetine, and fluoxetine.

Most importantly, if a doctor is thinking about a depression medicine for a young person, the family should be part of the choice. It is very important for adults to watch the young person closely after they start the medicine. They should look for any bad changes, especially any new thoughts about self-harm. Other treatments like talk therapy are also very important for helping young people with depression.","Newer generation antidepressants for depression in children and adolescents: a network meta‐analysis 
How well do newer formulations of antidepressants work for children and adolescents with clinical depression? 
Children and adolescents (6 to 18 years) with depression (also called ‘major depressive disorder’) experience a range of negative impacts in all areas of their lives and have an increased risk of suicide, suicidal thinking and suicide attempts. Antidepressants have been shown to reduce symptoms of depression, but can also increase the risk of suicide‐related outcomes. 
Who will be interested in this research? 
The research in this Cochrane Review will interest:
‐ people who decide policy, and influence decisions about the prescription of antidepressant medicines to children and adolescents; 
‐ people who prescribe these medicines to children and adolescents;
‐ children and adolescents with depression; and
‐ those who support and care for them (including their parents and caregivers and clinicians who provide treatment). 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out how well newer formulations (called ‘new generation’) antidepressants work to improve depression in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years. New generation antidepressants are those that have been developed recently. They are sometimes referred to as ‘second‐‘ and ‘third‐generation’ antidepressants; they do not include older formulations (tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors). 
We wanted to know how these antidepressants affect:
‐ symptoms of depression;
‐ recovery: no longer meeting diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder;
‐ response or remission: scores on a scale indicating an important reduction in depression or no longer experiencing depression; 
‐ ability to function in daily life;
‐ suicide‐related outcomes; and
‐ whether they cause any unwanted effects in children and adolescents.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that tested new generation antidepressants on children or adolescents (or both) who had been diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. We identified 26 such studies. We then assessed the trustworthiness of those studies, and synthesized the findings across the studies. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
Most newer antidepressants probably reduce depression symptoms better than a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment that does not contain any medicine but looks identical to the medicine being tested). However, the reduction is small and may not be experienced as important by children and adolescents, their parents and caregivers, or clinicians. When different medications are compared against each other, there may be only small and unimportant differences between most of them for the reduction of symptoms. 
Our findings reflect what happens on average to individuals, but some individuals may experience a greater response. This might lead to recommendations being made for the use of antidepressants for some individuals in some circumstances. Our findings suggest that sertraline, escitalopram, duloxetine and fluoxetine can be used if medication is being considered. 
The impact of medication on depression symptoms should be closely monitored by those prescribing the medication, especially as suicide‐related thinking and behaviour may be increased in those taking these medications. Close monitoring of suicide‐related behaviours is vital in those treated with new generation antidepressants. 
What should happen next? 
The studies that provided this evidence largely excluded children and adolescents who: 
‐ were already thinking about suicide and wanting to take their own lives (i.e. had suicidal ideation); 
‐ were self‐harming;
‐ had other mental health conditions; and
‐ had psychosocial difficulties.
Future research should aim to understand the impacts of these medicines in children and adolescents with these problems, who are more typical of those who request clinical services.

Finding the Best Ways to Keep Construction Workers Safe at Work

**Rationale**

Construction work can be a dangerous job. More workers get hurt in construction than in most other jobs. Getting hurt at work can cause pain and stress. It can also make it hard for a person to work and support their family.

Many companies and groups have ideas to make job sites safer. These ideas include safety rules and training programs. But we do not know for sure which of these ideas work best to stop injuries.

This study was done to find out which safety plans are proven to help. The goal was to look at past research on this topic. By finding what works, companies can use the best ideas to protect their workers from getting hurt.

**Trial Design**

This study was a review of past research. The study team did not do a new experiment with workers. Instead, they gathered and reviewed older studies that had already been done. They looked for studies about how to prevent injuries in construction workers. The team found 17 studies to include in their review.

These older studies looked at different types of safety ideas. Some of the ideas they looked at were:
*   New safety laws and rules.
*   Safety ads or campaigns to raise awareness.
*   Special training for workers.
*   Safety checks at the work site.
*   Health services for workers.
*   Giving companies money to help them buy safer tools and equipment.

The team read each study to see what it found. They also checked the quality of the proof from each study. This review includes research that was published up to April 2017.

**Results**

The main result was that the proof from past studies was not very strong. The team rated the proof they found as ""very low quality."" This means we cannot be very sure about what works best to keep workers safe. More research is still needed.

Some safety ideas did seem to help lower the number of injuries. Using many safety ideas at the same time may be a good approach. For example, a safety program might work better if it includes both safety training and a plan to stop drug use at work.

Giving companies money to buy safer gear may also help. One study showed that when companies got help to buy new, safer scaffolds, their workers had fewer injuries.

The review also found that some common ideas may not work well on their own. Just creating new safety laws might not be enough to stop injuries. Also, big safety campaigns for a whole region did not seem to reduce injuries.

The study team concluded that we need to do more. We need to find new ways to help bosses and workers follow safety rules. For most of the safety tips that are used today, we still need better proof to know if they truly work.","Interventions to reduce injuries in construction workers

10.1002-14651858.CD013285.pub2,"Background
There are many accepted airway clearance techniques (ACTs) for managing the respiratory health of people with cystic fibrosis (CF); none of which demonstrate superiority. Other Cochrane Reviews have reported short‐term effects related to mucus transport, but no evidence supporting long‐term benefits. Exercise is an alternative ACT thought to produce shearing forces within the lung parenchyma, which enhances mucociliary clearance and the removal of viscous secretions. 
Recent evidence suggests that some people with CF are using exercise as a substitute for traditional ACTs, yet there is no agreed recommendation for this. Additionally, one of the top 10 research questions identified by people with CF is whether exercise can replace other ACTs. 
Systematically reviewing the evidence for exercise as a safe and effective ACT will help people with CF decide whether to incorporate this strategy into their treatment plans and potentially reduce their treatment burden. The timing of this review is especially pertinent given the shifting landscape of CF management with the advent of highly‐effective small molecule therapies, which are changing the way people with CF are cared for. 
Objectives
To compare the effect of exercise to other ACTs for improving respiratory function and other clinical outcomes in people with CF and to assess the potential adverse effects associated with this ACT. 
Search methods
On 28 February 2022, we searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. 
We searched online clinical trial registries on 15 February 2022.
We emailed authors of studies awaiting classification or potentially eligible abstracts for additional information on 1 February 2021. 
Selection criteria
We selected randomised controlled studies (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing exercise to another ACT in people with CF for at least two treatment sessions. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias for the included studies. They assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Review authors contacted investigators for further relevant information regarding their publications. 
Main results
We included four RCTs. The 86 participants had a wide range of disease severity (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) ranged from 54% to 95%) and were 7 to 41 years old. Two RCTs were cross‐over and two were parallel in design. Participants in one RCT were hospitalised with an acute respiratory exacerbation, whilst the participants in three RCTs were clinically stable. All four RCTs compared exercise either alone or in combination with another ACT, but these were too diverse to allow us to combine results. The certainty of the evidence was very low; we downgraded it due to low participant numbers and high or unclear risks of bias across all domains. 
Exercise versus active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) 
One cross‐over trial (18 participants) compared exercise alone to ACBT. There was no change from baseline in our primary outcome FEV1, although it increased in the exercise group before returning to baseline after 30 minutes; we are unsure if exercise affected FEV1 as the evidence is very low‐certainty. Similar results were seen for other measures of lung function. No adverse events occurred during the exercise sessions (very low‐certainty evidence). We are unsure if ACBT was perceived to be more effective or was the preferred ACT (very low‐certainty evidence). 24‐hour sputum volume was less in the exercise group than with ACBT (secondary outcome). Exercise capacity, quality of life, adherence, hospitalisations and need for additional antibiotics were not reported. 
Exercise plus postural drainage and percussion (PD&P) versus PD&P only 
Two trials (55 participants) compared exercise and PD&P to PD&P alone. At two weeks, one trial narratively reported a greater increase in FEV1 % predicted with PD&P alone. At six months, the other trial reported a greater increase with exercise combined with PD&P, but did not provide data for the PD&P group. We are uncertain whether exercise with PD&P improves FEV1 as the certainty of evidence is very low. Other measures of lung function did not show clear evidence of effect. One trial reported no difference in exercise capacity (maximal work rate) after two weeks. No adverse events were reported (1 trial, 17 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Adherence was high, with all PD&P sessions and 96% of exercise sessions completed (1 trial, 17 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). There was no difference between groups in 24‐hour sputum volume or in the mean duration of hospitalisation, although the six‐month trial reported fewer hospitalisations due to exacerbations in the exercise and PD&P group. Quality of life, ACT preference and need for antibiotics were not reported. 
Exercise versus underwater positive expiratory pressure (uPEP) 
One trial (13 participants) compared exercise to uPEP (also known as bubble PEP). No adverse events were recorded in either group (very low‐certainty evidence). Trial investigators reported that participants perceived exercise as more fatiguing but also more enjoyable than bubble PEP (very low‐certainty evidence). There were no differences found in the total weight of sputum collected during treatment sessions. The trial did not report the primary outcomes (FEV1, quality of life, exercise capacity) or the secondary outcomes (other measures of lung function, adherence, need for antibiotics or hospitalisations). 
Authors' conclusions
As one of the top 10 research questions identified by clinicians and people with CF, it is important to systematically review the literature regarding whether or not exercise is an acceptable and effective ACT, and whether it can replace traditional methods. We identified an insufficient number of trials to conclude whether or not exercise is a suitable alternative ACT, and the diverse design of included trials did not allow for meta‐analysis of results. The evidence is very low‐certainty, so we are uncertain about the effectiveness of exercise as an ACT. Longer studies examining outcomes that are important to people with CF are required to answer this question.

Can Exercise Help Clear Lungs for People with Cystic Fibrosis?

**Rationale**

Cystic fibrosis, or CF, is a health problem that some people are born with. It causes the body to make very thick, sticky mucus. This mucus can build up in the lungs. It can make it hard to breathe and can lead to lung infections.

People with CF must clear this mucus from their lungs every day. They use special methods to do this. These methods are called airway clearance techniques, or ACTs. We can also call them lung cleaning methods. There are many different types of these methods. But we do not know which one is best.

Some people with CF use exercise to help clear their lungs. They hope it can work as well as other lung cleaning methods. Using exercise might make their daily care easier. People with CF and their doctors have said that this is a very important question. They want to know if exercise is a safe and good way to clear the lungs. This study looked at the research to try and find an answer.

**Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked for all the best studies that were already done on this topic. They wanted to combine the results to get a clearer answer. This is called a systematic review.

The researchers looked for studies that compared exercise to other lung cleaning methods in people with CF. They found 4 studies to include in their review. A total of 86 people with CF took part in these 4 studies.

The people in the studies were both children and adults. Their ages were from 7 to 41 years old. Some had more serious lung problems than others. Some were in the hospital because their breathing was worse. Others were at home and felt well. The studies were all designed differently and lasted for different amounts of time.

**Results**

The researchers found that there is not enough information to know if exercise can replace other lung cleaning methods. The studies they looked at were small. The studies were also very different from each other. This made it hard to compare their results. The researchers said the evidence was ""very low-certainty."" This means we cannot be sure about the results.

Here is what the single studies found:

*   **Exercise compared to special breathing exercises.** One small study looked at this. It found no clear difference in tests of lung health between the two groups. No one had any bad side effects from the exercise.
*   **Exercise plus chest clapping compared to chest clapping alone.** Two studies looked at this. The results were mixed and unclear. One study that lasted six months found that the exercise group had fewer hospital visits.
*   **Exercise compared to blowing bubbles in water.** One very small study looked at this. No one had any bad side effects. People in the study said that exercise was more fun but also made them more tired.

In the end, this review could not answer the main question. We still do not know if exercise is as good as other lung cleaning methods for people with CF. The researchers who did this review concluded that we need more research. We need bigger and longer studies to find a clear answer. These future studies should look at things that are important to people with CF, like how they feel and their quality of life.","Exercise versus airway clearance for people with cystic fibrosis
Review question 
Can exercise replace other methods of airway clearance for people with cystic fibrosis (CF)? 
Background 
CF affects many systems in the body, mainly the respiratory system. It causes a build‐up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs which causes irritation and damage to the lining of the airways. CF treatment involves chest physiotherapy, also called airway clearance, which uses a range of devices or techniques to get rid of this mucus. It has been suggested that exercise may have a similar effect. Exercising results in a person taking different volumes and depths of breaths. This leads to pressure changes and forces within the airways that move secretions out of the lungs. We compared the effect on lung function of exercise versus other techniques, to see if exercise is a suitable alternative for people with CF. We wanted to answer our review question to potentially reduce their treatment burden. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to 15 February 2022.
Study characteristics 
We searched the literature for studies where people received at least two treatment sessions of exercise or another airway clearance technique, and report on four studies including 86 people with CF in the review. The people in the studies were aged between 7 and 41 years and had varying degrees of disease severity. Three studies included people who were clinically well and one study included people admitted to hospital for a chest infection. The studies lasted between four days and six months and compared exercise (alone or in combination with another airway clearance technique) to other techniques. Two studies compared exercise with postural drainage and percussion (PD&P), one study compared exercise with the active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) and one study compared exercise with underwater positive expiratory pressure (uPEP), also known as bubble PEP. Three studies received financial support from funding bodies such as the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, the Buffalo Foundation and the Romanian National Council for Scientific Research in Higher Education. 
Key results 
We did not find enough evidence to conclude whether or not exercise can replace other methods of airway clearance. We did not find any evidence to suggest that exercise was either better or worse than other methods to improve lung function or clear mucus from the airways, although exercising did improve people's exercise ability, and it was the preferred choice of treatment in one study. None of the studies reported any negative effects of exercise therapy. None of the studies evaluated quality of life or the need for extra antibiotic treatment. One study did suggest that exercise alone was less effective at clearing sputum than ACBT. 
Exercise versus ACBT 
One study (18 participants) found that a measure of lung function temporarily (up to 30 minutes) increased in the exercise group only, otherwise there was no difference between the ACBT or the exercise group. No adverse events were reported, and it is not certain if ACBT was thought to be more effective or was preferred. The exercise group produced less sputum than the ACBT group. The study did not report on exercise capacity, quality of life, adherence, hospitalisations and need for additional antibiotics. 
Exercise plus PD&P versus PD&P alone 
Two studies (55 participants) compared exercise plus PD&P to PD&P alone. At two weeks, one trial described a greater increase in lung function with PD&P alone, while at six months the second study reported a greater increase with exercise plus PD&P (but did not provide data for the PD&P group). One study reported no side effects at all, and also reported no difference between groups in exercise capacity (maximal work rate), sputum volume or the average length of time spent in hospital. Conversely, the second study reported fewer hospitalisations due to exacerbations in the exercise and PD&P group. Neither study reported on quality of life, preference and the need for antibiotics. 
Exercise versus uPEP 
One study (13 participants) compared exercise to uPEP (also known as bubble PEP). No adverse events were recorded in either group and investigators reported that those taking part thought that, while exercise was more tiring, it was also more enjoyable than bubble PEP. We found no differences in the total weight of sputum collected during treatment sessions. The study did not report on lung function, quality of life, exercise capacity, adherence, need for antibiotics or hospitalisations. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Overall, we had very little confidence in the evidence because all four studies had few participants and two studies only presented results as a shortened report given at a conference.  
We do not think the fact that participants and people measuring the outcomes knew which treatment the participants were receiving influenced the results of outcomes such as lung function and sputum weight. We do not think the fact that these studies were financed should influence the interpretation of the results in this review.

10.1002-14651858.CD015397,"Background
With the emergence of SARS‐CoV‐2 in late 2019, governments worldwide implemented a multitude of non‐pharmaceutical interventions in order to control the spread of the virus. Most countries have implemented measures within the school setting in order to reopen schools or keep them open whilst aiming to contain the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2. For informed decision‐making on implementation, adaptation, or suspension of such measures, it is not only crucial to evaluate their effectiveness with regard to SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission, but also to assess their unintended consequences. 
Objectives
To comprehensively identify and map the evidence on the unintended health and societal consequences of school‐based measures to prevent and control the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2. We aimed to generate a descriptive overview of the range of unintended (beneficial or harmful) consequences reported as well as the study designs that were employed to assess these outcomes. This review was designed to complement an existing Cochrane Review on the effectiveness of these measures by synthesising evidence on the implications of the broader system‐level implications of school measures beyond their effects on SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, four non‐health databases, and two COVID‐19 reference collections on 26 March 2021, together with reference checking, citation searching, and Google searches. 
Selection criteria
We included quantitative (including mathematical modelling), qualitative, and mixed‐methods studies of any design that provided evidence on any unintended consequences of measures implemented in the school setting to contain the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic. Studies had to report on at least one unintended consequence, whether beneficial or harmful, of one or more relevant measures, as conceptualised in a logic model.  
Data collection and analysis
We screened the titles/abstracts and subsequently full texts in duplicate, with any discrepancies between review authors resolved through discussion. One review author extracted data for all included studies, with a second review author reviewing the data extraction for accuracy. The evidence was summarised narratively and graphically across four prespecified intervention categories and six prespecified categories of unintended consequences; findings were described as deriving from quantitative, qualitative, or mixed‐method studies. 
Main results
Eighteen studies met our inclusion criteria. Of these, 13 used quantitative methods (3 experimental/quasi‐experimental; 5 observational; 5 modelling); four used qualitative methods; and one used mixed methods. Studies looked at effects in different population groups, mainly in children and teachers. The identified interventions were assigned to four broad categories: 14 studies assessed measures to make contacts safer; four studies looked at measures to reduce contacts; six studies assessed surveillance and response measures; and one study examined multiple measures combined. Studies addressed a wide range of unintended consequences, most of them considered harmful. Eleven studies investigated educational consequences. Seven studies reported on psychosocial outcomes. Three studies each provided information on physical health and health behaviour outcomes beyond COVID‐19 and environmental consequences. Two studies reported on socio‐economic consequences, and no studies reported on equity and equality consequences. 
Authors' conclusions
We identified a heterogeneous evidence base on unintended consequences of measures implemented in the school setting to prevent and control the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2, and summarised the available study data narratively and graphically. Primary research better focused on specific measures and various unintended outcomes is needed to fill knowledge gaps and give a broader picture of the diverse unintended consequences of school‐based measures before a more thorough evidence synthesis is warranted. The most notable lack of evidence we found was regarding psychosocial, equity, and equality outcomes. We also found a lack of research on interventions that aim to reduce the opportunity for contacts. Additionally, study investigators should provide sufficient data on contextual factors and demographics in order to ensure analyses of such are feasible, thus assisting stakeholders in making appropriate, informed decisions for their specific circumstances.

Good and Bad Effects of School Rules During the COVID-19 Pandemic

**Rationale**
When the COVID-19 virus started to spread, governments made new rules to keep people safe. Schools also made rules to protect students and staff. These rules included things like wearing masks, staying far apart, and learning from home.

These rules were meant to stop the virus from spreading in schools. But the rules may have caused other effects, too. These other effects are called unintended consequences. Some of these effects might be good, and some might be harmful.

We wanted to learn about these other effects. This study looked at all the research that had been done on the topic. By putting all the information together, we can get a better idea of the big picture. Understanding all the effects of these school rules can help leaders make better decisions in the future.

**Trial Design**
This was not a new study with patients. Instead, this was a review study. This means our team looked for and read studies that other researchers had already finished.

We searched large computer databases to find these studies. We looked for any type of study that talked about the good or bad effects of COVID-19 rules in schools. The studies we found looked at school children and teachers from around the world.

Our team found 18 studies that fit what we were looking for. We read each study carefully to pull out the most important information. No new people took part in this review. We only used information that was already published.

**Results**
Our review of 18 studies found that COVID-19 school rules had many other effects. Most of the effects that were reported were seen as harmful.

The studies we found looked at different types of effects.
*   About 11 studies looked at how the rules changed learning and schoolwork.
*   About 7 studies looked at mental health. This means they studied things like stress, worry, or feeling sad.
*   A few studies looked at physical health and money problems for families.
*   No studies looked at fairness. We could not find any research that asked if the rules affected some groups of students more than others.

This review showed us that there is not enough research on the other effects of school rules. We need to know more about how these rules affect the mental health of students and teachers. We also need to know if the rules were fair for everyone.

The researchers who did this study believe that we need more research. Better studies can help fill in the gaps in what we know. With more information, leaders can make choices that are safe and good for all students.","Unintended consequences of school‐based measures to manage the COVID‐19 pandemic
Why is this question important? 
Countries worldwide have taken many public health and social measures to prevent and control the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2, a highly contagious respiratory virus responsible for COVID‐19. A range of measures have been put in place to minimise transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 within schools and the wider community. Schools have the potential to be settings of high viral transmission because they involve extended interactions amongst people in close proximity. A previous review located and examined studies on the effectiveness of such school‐based measures regarding SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission. It is equally important to look at their unintended consequences on health and society in order that policymakers and parents can make informed decisions. Unintended consequences of a public health measure may be beneficial or harmful (or a mix of both). A public health measure may result in a mix of benefits and harms. For this review, we planned to examine the unintended consequences of measures designed to prevent and control the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 in schools. This review can therefore be seen as complementing the previous review on the effectiveness of such measures.    
What did we do? 
Firstly, we searched nine databases for studies that assessed any measure put in place in the school settings (primary or secondary schools, or both) to prevent transmission of the virus. We considered all types of studies and a broad range of outcomes. 
Secondly, we grouped the identified studies according to the types of measures they examined. We then described which approaches were used in the studies, where these were conducted, and which unintended consequences were evaluated.  
What did we find? 
We found 18 studies that matched our inclusion criteria. Five studies used ‘real‐life’ data (observational studies); five studies used data generated by a computer and based on a set of assumptions (modelling studies); three studies were experimental studies (e.g. laboratory‐based); and four studies used qualitative methods, meaning they based their findings on interviews with people. One study used mixed methods, combining numerical and non‐numerical (qualitative) information.  
Studies examined four different types of measures, as follows.
‐ Measures to reduce contacts (4 studies): policies to reduce the number of students in the school building (i.e. reducing the number of students present per class) and/or to reduce the number of contacts of students (e.g. through defined groups or staggered arrival, breaks, and departures). 
‐ Measures to make contacts safer (14 studies): practices to ensure safer contacts between people in the school and classroom setting (e.g. mask mandates or distancing regulations), to modify the environment or activities (e.g. enhanced cleaning or ventilation practices). 
‐ Surveillance and response measures to detect SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (6 studies): testing and/or screening strategies (e.g. temperature taking, screening tests for students and staff, and testing of symptomatic students and staff) and self‐isolation or quarantine measures. 
‐ Multicomponent measures (1 study): interventions using a combination of at least two of the above measures. 
We looked at the following unintended outcomes.
‐ Educational consequences (11 studies), e.g. changes in school performance, advancement to the next grade, or change in graduation numbers. 
‐ Psychosocialoutcomes (7 studies), e.g. mental health, anxieties about going to school. 
‐ Physical health and health behaviour outcomes beyond COVID‐19 (3 studies), e.g. hand eczema due to increased handwashing. 
‐ Environmental consequences (3 studies), e.g. changes in air quality in classrooms. 
‐ Socio‐economic consequences (2 studies), e.g. economic burden on families.  
What did we conclude? 
We identified a wide range of unintended consequences of school‐based measures designed to prevent the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2. However, the evidence base is small, and there are large gaps where more research is needed. This scoping review is a first step in gauging the extent of those consequences. More research is needed to collect additional information and to enable a more thorough analysis of the evidence. Psychosocial consequences (e.g. mental health issues, depression, loneliness) and equity and equality consequences (e.g. disadvantages for children from low‐income households, unfair distribution of work between genders for parents, are in need of further attention. We recommend that future research look at interventions such as fixed groups, alternating physical presence at school and staggered arrival departure and break times, as well as testing and quarantine measures.  
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to March 2021.

The patch is a small, thin, adhesive square that is applied to the skin. The contraceptive vaginal ring is a flexible, lightweight device that is inserted into the vagina. Both methods release drugs like those in birth control pills. These methods could be used more consistently than pills because they do not require a daily dose. This review looked at how well the methods worked to prevent pregnancy, if they caused bleeding problems, if women used them as prescribed, and how safe they were.

Of 12 ring trials, 11 looked at the marketed ring and pills while one studied a ring being developed. The methods compared had similar pregnancy rates.

Comparing Birth Control: The Skin Patch, the Vaginal Ring, and the Pill

### **Rationale**

Birth control helps people plan when to have children. Birth control pills are a common choice. But you must remember to take a pill every day.

The skin patch and the vaginal ring are two other types of birth control.
*   The **skin patch** is a small sticker that you put on your skin.
*   The **vaginal ring** is a small, soft ring that you put inside your birth canal.

Both the patch and the ring work like birth control pills. They release small amounts of hormones. Hormones are chemicals your body makes to control how it works. These hormones stop your body from getting pregnant.

Since you do not need to use the patch or ring every day, they might be easier to use correctly than pills. Researchers wanted to know if the patch and ring work as well as pills. They also wanted to know if they have different side effects. This study was done to compare these three birth control methods.

### **Trial Design**

This was a review study. This means the researchers did not do a new experiment. Instead, they looked for and studied the results of past studies.

The researchers looked for studies that were done up to February 2013. They found 18 studies that compared these birth control methods.
*   6 of the studies looked at the skin patch compared to pills.
*   12 of the studies looked at the vaginal ring compared to pills.

The women in these studies were all using one of these three birth control methods. The goal was to bring all the information together to get a clearer picture of how the methods compare.

### **Results**

The review found that the skin patch, the vaginal ring, and the pills all worked about the same to prevent pregnancy. All three are good at stopping pregnancy when used the right way.

**The Skin Patch Compared to Pills**
Women who used the skin patch were better at using their birth control correctly than women who used pills.

However, women using the patch had more side effects. These included breast pain, painful periods, and feeling sick to their stomach. More women who used the patch decided to stop being in the study early compared to women who took pills.

**The Vaginal Ring Compared to Pills**
Women using the vaginal ring had more irritation inside their birth canal than women on the pill.

But, women using the ring had fewer other side effects. They had less acne, felt less sad or moody, and felt sick to their stomach less often than pill users. Ring users also had fewer bleeding problems between their periods.

**Conclusions from the Researchers**
The researchers found that the information from the patch studies was not as good as the information from the ring studies. Some of the patch studies were missing important details. This made it harder to be sure about the results for the patch.

Overall, the patch and the ring work just as well as pills to prevent pregnancy. But they have different side effects. This information can help people choose the birth control method that is best for them. The researchers said that we need better studies in the future, especially for the skin patch.","Skin patch or vaginal ring compared to pills for birth control

10.1002-14651858.CD013699,"Background
Reducing the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) is a global priority. Contact tracing identifies people who were recently in contact with an infected individual, in order to isolate them and reduce further transmission. Digital technology could be implemented to augment and accelerate manual contact tracing. Digital tools for contact tracing may be grouped into three areas: 1) outbreak response; 2) proximity tracing; and 3) symptom tracking. We conducted a rapid review on the effectiveness of digital solutions to contact tracing during infectious disease outbreaks. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits, harms, and acceptability of personal digital contact tracing solutions for identifying contacts of an identified positive case of an infectious disease. 
Search methods
An information specialist searched the literature from 1 January 2000 to 5 May 2020 in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. Additionally, we screened the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs, quasi‐RCTs, cohort studies, cross‐sectional studies and modelling studies, in general populations. We preferentially included studies of contact tracing during infectious disease outbreaks (including COVID‐19, Ebola, tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome) as direct evidence, but considered comparative studies of contact tracing outside an outbreak as indirect evidence. 
The digital solutions varied but typically included software (or firmware) for users to install on their devices or to be uploaded to devices provided by governments or third parties. Control measures included traditional or manual contact tracing, self‐reported diaries and surveys, interviews, other standard methods for determining close contacts, and other technologies compared to digital solutions (e.g. electronic medical records). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened records and all potentially relevant full‐text publications. One review author extracted data for 50% of the included studies, another extracted data for the remaining 50%; the second review author checked all the extracted data. One review author assessed quality of included studies and a second checked the assessments. Our outcomes were identification of secondary cases and close contacts, time to complete contact tracing, acceptability and accessibility issues, privacy and safety concerns, and any other ethical issue identified. Though modelling studies will predict estimates of the effects of different contact tracing solutions on outcomes of interest, cohort studies provide empirically measured estimates of the effects of different contact tracing solutions on outcomes of interest. We used GRADE‐CERQual to describe certainty of evidence from qualitative data and GRADE for modelling and cohort studies. 
Main results
We identified six cohort studies reporting quantitative data and six modelling studies reporting simulations of digital solutions for contact tracing. Two cohort studies also provided qualitative data. Three cohort studies looked at contact tracing during an outbreak, whilst three emulated an outbreak in non‐outbreak settings (schools). Of the six modelling studies, four evaluated digital solutions for contact tracing in simulated COVID‐19 scenarios, while two simulated close contacts in non‐specific outbreak settings. 
Modelling studies 
Two modelling studies provided low‐certainty evidence of a reduction in secondary cases using digital contact tracing (measured as average number of secondary cases per index case ‐ effective reproductive number (Reff)). One study estimated an 18% reduction in Reff with digital contact tracing compared to self‐isolation alone, and a 35% reduction with manual contact‐tracing. Another found a reduction in Reff for digital contact tracing compared to self‐isolation alone (26% reduction) and a reduction in Reff for manual contact tracing compared to self‐isolation alone (53% reduction). However, the certainty of evidence was reduced by unclear specifications of their models, and assumptions about the effectiveness of manual contact tracing (assumed 95% to 100% of contacts traced), and the proportion of the population who would have the app (53%). 
Cohort studies 
Two cohort studies provided very low‐certainty evidence of a benefit of digital over manual contact tracing. During an Ebola outbreak, contact tracers using an app found twice as many close contacts per case on average than those using paper forms. Similarly, after a pertussis outbreak in a US hospital, researchers found that radio‐frequency identification identified 45 close contacts but searches of electronic medical records found 13. The certainty of evidence was reduced by concerns about imprecision, and serious risk of bias due to the inability of contact tracing study designs to identify the true number of close contacts. 
One cohort study provided very low‐certainty evidence that an app could reduce the time to complete a set of close contacts. The certainty of evidence for this outcome was affected by imprecision and serious risk of bias. Contact tracing teams reported that digital data entry and management systems were faster to use than paper systems and possibly less prone to data loss. 
Two studies from lower‐ or middle‐income countries, reported that contact tracing teams found digital systems simpler to use and generally preferred them over paper systems; they saved personnel time, reportedly improved accuracy with large data sets, and were easier to transport compared with paper forms. However, personnel faced increased costs and internet access problems with digital compared to paper systems. 
Devices in the cohort studies appeared to have privacy from contacts regarding the exposed or diagnosed users. However, there were risks of privacy breaches from snoopers if linkage attacks occurred, particularly for wearable devices. 
Authors' conclusions
The effectiveness of digital solutions is largely unproven as there are very few published data in real‐world outbreak settings. Modelling studies provide low‐certainty evidence of a reduction in secondary cases if digital contact tracing is used together with other public health measures such as self‐isolation. Cohort studies provide very low‐certainty evidence that digital contact tracing may produce more reliable counts of contacts and reduce time to complete contact tracing. Digital solutions may have equity implications for at‐risk populations with poor internet access and poor access to digital technology. 
Stronger primary research on the effectiveness of contact tracing technologies is needed, including research into use of digital solutions in conjunction with manual systems, as digital solutions are unlikely to be used alone in real‐world settings. Future studies should consider access to and acceptability of digital solutions, and the resultant impact on equity. Studies should also make acceptability and uptake a primary research question, as privacy concerns can prevent uptake and effectiveness of these technologies.

Can Phone Apps and Other Digital Tools Help Stop the Spread of Sickness?

### **Rationale**

When a person gets sick with a disease that spreads easily, like COVID-19, it is important to stop the sickness from spreading to others. One way to do this is called contact tracing. Contact tracing means finding every person who was recently near the sick person. This helps those people stay away from others so they do not spread the disease more.

Usually, people do contact tracing by calling others on the phone. This is called manual contact tracing. This can take a lot of time and work. Researchers think that using digital tools, like phone apps, could make contact tracing faster and better.

This review looked at past studies to find out if digital tools for contact tracing really work. The researchers wanted to know if these tools are better than the old way of tracing contacts. They also looked at the good and bad things about using them, and if people's private information is kept safe.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with patients. Instead, the researchers looked for and reviewed 12 other studies that had already been done on this topic. They looked at studies that were published between the years 2000 and 2020.

The studies were about diseases that spread easily, like COVID-19, Ebola, and whooping cough. They looked at two main types of studies:

*   Some studies used computers to guess what might happen if digital tools were used. These are called modelling studies.
*   Other studies watched what happened in real life when digital tools were used. These are called cohort studies.

These studies compared digital contact tracing to the usual manual contact tracing done by health workers.

### **Results**

The researchers were not very sure about the results from the studies they found. The proof that digital tools work well was not very strong.

The computer studies guessed that using a phone app for contact tracing could help slow down the spread of a sickness. But these studies also suggested that the old way of tracing by hand might work even better. The researchers were not very confident in these results. The computer models had to guess how many people would use an app.

The real-life studies showed that digital tools might help in some ways. For example, during an Ebola outbreak, health workers using a digital app found twice as many contacts as workers using paper forms. Health workers also said the digital tools were faster and easier to use than paper.

But there were also some problems with the digital tools. They cost more money and needed a good internet connection, which not everyone has. This could be unfair to some people. There was also a risk that people's private information was not safe from hackers.

The people who did this review concluded that we do not have enough proof that digital tools are helpful in stopping sickness. More and better research is needed to know for sure. Future studies should check if these tools are safe and easy for everyone to use.","Are digital contact tracing technologies effective during infectious disease outbreaks?
Why is this question important? 
The global COVID‐19 pandemic highlights the importance of accurate and timely contact tracing. Contact tracing tells people that they may have been near someone with ‐ or showing symptoms of ‐ an infectious disease, allowing them to self‐isolate and helping to stop the spread of infection. Traditionally, contact tracing begins with notification that someone has an infectious disease. They are asked to recall their contacts, going back two to three days before symptom onset. This is time‐consuming and may not always give a complete picture, so digital aids could help contact tracers. 
Digital contact tracing uses technology to track and trace contacts. Individuals download an app onto their smartphones and record location and symptom information, or their devices might use location‐finding technology, like Bluetooth or GPS (global positioning system). If the user is infected, the technology identifies close contacts and/or secondary infections (people to whom they passed the disease), and informs people whom they have been near. The technology identifies where the infection was passed on and its duration (the context). 
However, problems may occur where access to technology is limited, in low‐income settings or for elderly people, for example. Also, some people see it as an invasion of privacy and are suspicious of how their data will be used. 
We wanted to know whether digital contact tracing, compared to manual contact tracing, is effective in reducing the spread of infection, as measured by secondary infections, identifying close contacts, tracing a complete set of contacts, and identifying the context of infection. 
What did we do? 
We searched medical databases for studies that assessed digital contact tracing. We preferred studies set during infectious disease outbreaks, which assessed real people in real time, but we included studies in any setting and of any design. 
To answer our question quickly, we shortened some steps of the Cochrane review process, however, we are confident in our conclusions. 
What we found 
We found 12 relevant studies. Six assessed the effectiveness of digital contact tracing on specific groups (cohorts) of people: three during an outbreak (Ebola in Sierra Leone; tuberculosis in Botswana; and whooping cough (pertussis) in USA); and three replicated an outbreak in schools to assess systems for identifying close contacts of participants. The remaining six were modelling studies, which simulated digital contact tracing. 
Main results 
Digital contact tracing with self‐isolation probably reduces the number of secondary infections, but not as much as manual contact tracing with self‐isolation (2 modelling studies). 
Digital contact tracing found more close contacts in two outbreaks than manual (2 studies in USA and Sierra Leone). Devices in non‐outbreak settings can identify more close contacts than self‐reported diaries or surveys. 
An app may reduce the time to complete a set of close contacts (1 study). Digital systems were faster to use than paper systems for recording new contacts and monitoring known contacts, and possibly less prone to data loss. 
Problems with system access (2 studies) included patchy network coverage, lack of data, technical problems and higher staff training needs. Contact tracers' personal expenses increased (1 study) due to travel and recharging phone batteries. Devices all appeared to protect diagnosed users from contacts, snoopers and authorities but one app's users were members of public health agencies. Studies recorded stolen hardware (second‐hand mobile phones); reported that paper forms were ""often lost"", and that digital data were password protected (2 studies) and encrypted (1 study). 
We found no evidence on contextual information and acceptability.
What this means 
It is unlikely that digital technologies would be the sole method of contact tracing during an outbreak; they would probably be used alongside manual methods. Unfortunately, the technology is largely unproven in real‐world outbreak settings and none of our included studies assessed digital plus manual contact tracing with digital contact tracing alone. Our included studies assessed different technologies and used different methods from each other, so we are uncertain about their evidence. 
Governments that implement digital contact tracing should ensure that at‐risk populations are not disadvantaged and take privacy concerns into account. 
This review is up to date to May 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD013515.pub2,"Background
Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are a group of musculoskeletal disorders affecting the jaw. They are frequently associated with pain that can be difficult to manage and may become persistent (chronic). Psychological therapies aim to support people with TMDs to manage their pain, leading to reduced pain, disability and distress. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of psychological therapies in people (aged 12 years and over) with painful TMD lasting 3 months or longer. 
Search methods
Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched six bibliographic databases up to 21 October 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished and ongoing studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any psychological therapy (e.g. cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), behaviour therapy (BT), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), mindfulness) for the management of painful TMD. We compared these against control or alternative treatment (e.g. oral appliance, medication, physiotherapy). 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We reported outcome data immediately after treatment and at the longest available follow‐up. 
We used the Cochrane RoB 1 tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies. Two review authors independently assessed each included study for any risk of bias in sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting of outcomes, and other issues. We judged the certainty of the evidence for each key comparison and outcome as high, moderate, low or very low according to GRADE criteria. 
Main results
We identified 22 RCTs (2001 participants), carried out between 1967 and 2021. We were able to include 12 of these studies in meta‐analyses. The risk of bias was high across studies, and we judged the certainty of the evidence to be low to very low overall; further research may change the findings. Our key outcomes of interest were: pain intensity, disability caused by pain, adverse events and psychological distress. Treatments varied in length, with the shortest being 4 weeks. The follow‐up time ranged from 3 months to 12 months. Most studies evaluated CBT.   
At treatment completion, there was no evidence of a benefit of CBT on pain intensity when measured against alternative treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.03, confidence interval (CI) ‐0.21 to 0.28; P = 0.79; 5 studies, 509 participants) or control (SMD ‐0.09, CI ‐0.30 to 0.12; P = 0.41; 6 studies, 577 participants). At follow‐up, there was evidence of a small benefit of CBT for reducing pain intensity compared to alternative treatment (SMD ‐0.29, 95% CI ‐0.50 to ‐0.08; 5 studies, 475 participants) and control (SMD ‐0.30, CI ‐0.51 to ‐0.09; 6 studies, 639 participants). 
At treatment completion, there was no evidence of a difference in disability outcomes (interference in activities caused by pain) between CBT and alternative treatment (SMD 0.15, CI ‐0.40 to 0.10; P = 0.25; 3 studies, 245 participants), or between CBT and control/usual care (SMD 0.02, CI ‐0.21 to 0.24; P = 0.88; 3 studies, 315 participants). Nor was there evidence of a difference at follow‐up (CBT versus alternative treatment: SMD ‐0.15, CI ‐0.42 to 0.12; 3 studies, 245 participants; CBT versus control: SMD 0.01 CI ‐ 0.61 to 0.64; 2 studies, 240 participants). 
There were very few data on adverse events. From the data available, adverse effects associated with psychological treatment tended to be minor and to occur less often than in alternative treatment groups. There were, however, insufficient data available to draw firm conclusions. 
CBT showed a small benefit in terms of reducing psychological distress at treatment completion compared to alternative treatment (SMD ‐0.32, 95% CI ‐0.50 to ‐0.15; 6 studies, 553 participants), which was maintained at follow‐up (SMD ‐0.32, 95% CI ‐0.51 to ‐0.13; 6 studies, 516 participants). For CBT versus control, only one study reported results for distress and did not find evidence of a difference between groups at treatment completion (mean difference (MD) 2.36, 95% CI ‐1.17 to 5.89; 101 participants) or follow‐up (MD ‐1.02, 95% CI ‐4.02 to 1.98; 101 participants). 
We assessed the certainty of the evidence to be low or very low for all comparisons and outcomes. 
The data were insufficient to draw any reliable conclusions about psychological therapies other than CBT. 
Authors' conclusions
We found mixed evidence for the effects of psychological therapies on painful temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). There is low‐certainty evidence that CBT may reduce pain intensity more than alternative treatments or control when measured at longest follow‐up,  but not at treatment completion. There is low‐certainty evidence that CBT may be better than alternative treatments, but not control, for reducing psychological distress at treatment completion and follow‐up. There is low‐certainty evidence that CBT may not be better than other treatments or control for pain disability outcomes.  
There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about alternative psychological therapeutic approaches, and there are insufficient data to be clear about adverse effects that may be associated with psychological therapies for painful TMD.  
Overall, we found insufficient evidence on which to base a reliable judgement about the efficacy of psychological therapies for painful TMD. Further research is needed to determine whether or not psychological therapies are effective, the most effective type of therapy and delivery method, and how it can best be targeted. In particular, high‐quality RCTs conducted in primary care and community settings are required, which evaluate a range of psychological approaches against alternative treatments or usual care, involve both adults and adolescents, and collect measures of pain intensity, pain disability and psychological distress until at least 12 months post‐treatment.

Do Talk Therapies Help People with Long-Lasting Jaw Pain?

### **Rationale**

Some people have problems with their jaw joint and the muscles around it. This is a condition called a temporomandibular disorder, or TMD. TMD can cause pain that lasts for a long time. This long-lasting pain can make it hard to do daily activities and can make people feel upset or worried.

One way to treat this pain is with talk therapies. These are therapies where you talk with a professional to learn new ways to cope with pain. The hope is that these therapies can help reduce pain and the stress it causes.

Researchers wanted to know if talk therapies really work for people with TMD. They looked at all the past research on this topic. This study aims to see what that research says about how well talk therapies help with long-lasting jaw pain.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, the researchers looked for all the studies that had already been done on this topic. They combined the results from these past studies to get a clearer picture of what works.

The researchers looked for a specific type of study. In these studies, people were put into different groups by chance to compare treatments. The studies included about 2,000 people who were 12 years or older. All of these people had jaw pain that had lasted for 3 months or more.

In the studies, one group of people would get a talk therapy. Most of the studies looked at a type called Cognitive Behavior Therapy, or CBT. CBT helps people change how they think and act in response to their pain. Other groups in the studies got a different treatment, like a mouth guard or medicine. Some groups got no new treatment at all.

The treatments in these studies lasted for at least 4 weeks. The researchers who did the original studies checked on the patients to see how they were doing. They checked on them for up to one year after their treatment ended.

### **Results**

The researchers found that the results from the past studies were mixed. They said that the proof that talk therapies work for jaw pain is not very strong. This means we cannot be very sure about the results, and new studies might find different answers.

**What did the study find about pain?**
The results for pain were different depending on when people were asked. Right after the talk therapy ended, it did not seem to reduce pain any more than other treatments did. But when researchers looked at people several months later, there was a small benefit. People who had the talk therapy CBT seemed to have a little less pain in the long run.

**Did therapy help with daily life?**
Long-lasting pain can make it hard to do your normal activities. The researchers checked if talk therapy helped people get back to their daily lives. They found no proof that it helped. People who got CBT were not able to do their daily tasks any better than people who got other treatments.

**Did therapy help with feelings?**
Living with pain can be stressful and upsetting. The researchers found that CBT did seem to help with these feelings. People who got CBT felt less upset than people who got other treatments like medicine. This benefit was seen right after treatment and also several months later.

**Were there any side effects?**
The researchers tried to find out if talk therapies had any bad side effects. There was not much information about this in the studies. From the little information they found, it seems that talk therapies had fewer and less serious side effects than other treatments. But the researchers said there was not enough information to be sure.

**What did the researchers conclude?**
The researchers concluded that we do not have enough proof to know for sure if talk therapies work well for long-lasting jaw pain. The evidence they found was weak.

There is a small sign that the talk therapy CBT may help reduce pain over time. It may also help people feel less worried or upset. But it may not help people get back to their normal daily activities. We need more and better studies to find out for sure what treatments work best for people with jaw pain.","What are the benefits and risks of psychological therapies for adults and young people over 12 years old with painful temporomandibular disorders (TMDs)? 
Key messages 
The overall results are mixed, but indicate that psychological therapies may be a useful approach for painful TMD as there is some limited evidence that they can reduce the pain. Our review suggests that they may do this at least as well as other available treatments. Any negative effects of psychological therapies are unclear, and more research is needed before we can know whether they provide a noticeable benefit while causing no or few problems. 
What is the condition? 
Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are conditions that affect the jaw joint and the muscles that move it. They are often associated with pain that lasts more than 3 months (known as chronic pain). Other symptoms include limited mouth opening, and jaw clicking and locking. All symptoms can interfere with quality of life and mood. 
What did we want to know? 
We wanted to find out how effective psychological therapies are for adults and young people over the age of 12 years who have painful TMD that has lasted at least 3 months. 
What did we do? 
We searched databases of medical and dental journals and research studies. We only selected studies known as 'randomised controlled trials (RCTs)'. In this type of study, participants are allocated to groups randomly. One group receives the intervention and the other receives a different treatment or no treatment at all. RCTs aim to reduce the risk of introducing bias in clinical studies. 
We looked for reports of RCTs of psychological therapies compared to different treatments or no treatment in people over 12 years of age. Most of the reports we found compared psychological therapy to medication or the use of a special mouthguard.  
We chose to focus on three measures of success. These were reduction in pain intensity, interference with activities caused by pain ('pain disability'), and psychological distress. We looked for details of these measures immediately after treatment and a few months later. We also looked for information on any 'adverse effects' (negative side effects of the treatments).  
We used standard Cochrane methods to decide which studies to include, collect the key information from the studies, judge whether or not the studies were biased in any way, and judge how certain we can be about the results. 
What did we find? 
Overall we found 22 relevant studies. Most of the studies reported on one particular form of psychological therapy called cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). We did not have enough information to draw any conclusions about any other psychological therapies. 
The results told us that CBT was no different to other treatments (e.g. oral splints, medicine) or usual care/no treatment in reducing the intensity of the TMD pain by the end of treatment. There was some evidence that people who had CBT might have slightly less pain a few months after treatment.  
There was some evidence that CBT might be better than other treatments for reducing psychological distress both at the end of treatment and a few months later. This was not seen in the one study that compared CBT against usual care. 
In terms of how much pain interfered with activities, there was no evidence that there was any difference between CBT and other treatments.  
There was too little information to be sure about whether psychological treatments cause adverse effects (problems caused by treatment such as feeling unwell or worse pain or unexpected effects). Only six of the 22 studies measured what adverse effects participants experienced. In these six studies, adverse effects associated with psychological treatment seemed to be minor in general and to occur less often than in alternative treatment groups.  
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We have little confidence in the evidence because many of the studies had design limitations. There was also variation in the length of treatment and in how it was delivered. This means that we need to be cautious in interpreting the results that we found and they may not be reliable. 
How up to date is the evidence? 
We searched for studies up to 21 October 2021.

New minimal invasive surgeries have been suggested as alternative options to transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for the management of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy is a new technology that uses targeted, controlled water vapour energy (steam) to create necrotic tissue in the prostate. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. 
Search methods
We performed a comprehensive search of multiple databases (the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Latin American and the Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, Scopus, Web of Science), trials registries, other sources of grey literature, and conference proceedings published up to 18 February 2020, with no restriction on the language or status of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included parallel‐group randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs, and non‐randomised observational prospective studies with concurrent comparison groups, in which men with BPH underwent convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy, another active therapy, or a sham procedure. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We had planned to perform statistical analyses using a random‐effects model, and interpret them according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We rated the certainty of the evidence according to the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included a single, industry‐sponsored RCT, with 197 randomised men, that compared convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy to a sham procedure. The mean age 62.9 years, the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) was 21.97, and the mean prostate volume was 45.4 mL. We only found short‐term data, measured up to three months. 
Primary outcomes 
Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy may improve urologic symptom scores more than a sham procedure, measured on a IPSS scale (0 to 35; higher score represents worse urological symptoms) by a mean difference (MD) of ‐6.9 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐9.06 to ‐4.74; 195 men; low‐certainty evidence), and likely improves quality of life (QoL), measured on a IPSS‐QoL scale (0 to 6; higher score represents worse QoL), by a MD of ‐1.2 (95% CI ‐1.66 to ‐0.74; 195 men; moderate‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effects of convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy on major adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 6.79, 95% CI 0.39 to 117.00; 197 men; very low‐certainty evidence) assessed by the Clavien‐Dindo classification system of III, IV, and V complications. 
Secondary outcomes 
We are very uncertain about the effects of convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy on retreatment (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.06 to 32.86; 197 men; very low‐certainty evidence). Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy may have little to no effect on erectile function (MD 0.4, 95% CI ‐1.91 to 2.71; 130 men; low‐certainty evidence) and ejaculatory function (MD 0.5, 95% CI ‐0.83 to 1.83; 130 men; low‐certainty evidence). Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy may increase minor adverse events assessed by the Clavien‐Dindo classification system of Grade I and II complications (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.11; 197 men; low‐certainty evidence). This would correspond to 434 minor adverse events per 1000 men (95% CI 264 more to 714 more). We are very uncertain about the effects of convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy on acute urinary retention (RR 4.98, 95% CI 0.28 to 86.63; 197 men; very low‐certainty evidence). It likely greatly increases the rate of men requiring indwelling urinary catheters (RR 35.58, 95% CI 15.37 to 82.36; 197 men; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
We were unable to perform any of the predefined secondary analyses.
We found no evidence for other comparisons, such as convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy versus TURP or other minimal invasive procedures. 
Authors' conclusions
Compared to a sham procedure, urologic symptom scores and quality of life appear to improve with convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy, but we are very uncertain about major adverse events. The certainty of evidence ranged from moderate to very low, with study limitations and imprecision being the most common reasons for rating down. These findings are based on a single industry‐sponsored study, with three‐month short‐term follow‐up. We did not find any studies comparing convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy to any other active treatment form, such as TURP.

A New Steam Treatment for Men with an Enlarged Prostate

**Rationale**

As men get older, their prostate gland can grow larger. This is a common condition that is not cancer. A large prostate can press on the tube that carries urine (pee) out of the body. This can make it hard to pee.

Men with an enlarged prostate may have to pee very often. They might have a weak stream or feel like they cannot empty their bladder all the way. These problems can affect a person’s quality of life.

Doctors have treatments that can help. One common treatment is surgery. But researchers are always looking for new treatments that are easier on the body. This study looked at a new treatment that uses steam. The steam removes the extra prostate tissue that causes the problems. Researchers wanted to know if this new steam treatment is safe and if it helps men with peeing problems.

**Trial Design**

This report is a review of one medical study. The study included about 200 men who had peeing problems from an enlarged prostate. The average age of the men was 63 years.

The men were split into two groups by chance.
*   One group got the new steam treatment.
*   The other group got a fake treatment. A fake treatment has no active medicine or therapy. This helps researchers see if the real treatment works better than nothing.

Doctors checked on the men in both groups for 3 months to see how they were doing.

**Results**

The study found that the new steam treatment seemed to help with peeing problems.
*   Men who got the steam treatment had fewer symptoms after 3 months.
*   These men also said their quality of life was better.

However, the treatment did have some side effects.
*   Men who got the steam treatment had more minor side effects than men who got the fake treatment.
*   For example, men in the steam treatment group were much more likely to need a catheter after the treatment. A catheter is a thin tube that is placed in the bladder to help drain pee. This was needed for a short time.

The researchers were not sure about serious side effects. There was not enough information from this one study to know for sure. The steam treatment seemed to have little to no effect on a man’s ability to have an erection or on his ejaculation.

The authors of this report concluded that the steam treatment may help reduce peeing problems. But we need more research. This conclusion is based on only one study that lasted for a short time. The company that makes the steam treatment device paid for the study. Also, the study did not compare the new steam treatment to the standard surgery. This means we do not know if it is better, worse, or the same as other available treatments.","Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy for lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia 
Review Question 
What are the effects of convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy in men with bothersome urinary symptoms because of an enlarged prostate? 
Background 
Prostate enlargement is common in older men, and can cause bothersome urinary symptoms, such as having to pass their water (voiding) often, a weak stream while voiding, or dribbling. If lifestyle changes and medications don't help, a variety of surgical procedures, including transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), can improve these symptoms. They may also cause unwanted effects, such as problems with ejaculation or erections. Recently, a new procedure called 'convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy' has become available. It is unclear how it compares to other treatments, such as TURP. 
Study characteristics  We found a single study, with 197 men, that compared convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy to a sham procedure (men were made to believe they received treatment, while in reality, they did not), funded by the device company. The men's average age was 62.9 years, and most had a moderate degree of bothersome urinary symptoms. 
We found no studies that compared convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy to another form of active treatment, such as TURP that men with an enlarged prostate and bothersome symptoms might otherwise choose. 
Key results 
Compared to a sham procedure, and with a three‐month follow‐up, convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy may improve urinary symptoms (low certainty of evidence). Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy also likely improves quality of life (moderate certainty of evidence). We are very uncertain whether serious unwanted side effects are more common or not (very low certainty of evidence). Men's erections and ejaculations may be similar in men who have convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy and those who receive the sham procedure (low certainty of evidence). 
Findings of this review are up to date until 18 February 2020.
Certainty of the evidence 
We judged the certainty of the evidence for the outcomes to be moderate, low or very low. Reasons for not being so confident had to do with the study design and the study size.

10.1002-14651858.CD013190,"Background
Melanoma has one of the fastest rising incidence rates of any cancer. It accounts for a small percentage of skin cancer cases but is responsible for the majority of skin cancer deaths. Early detection and treatment is key to improving survival; however, anxiety around missing early cases needs to be balanced against appropriate levels of referral and excision of benign lesions. Used in conjunction with clinical or dermoscopic suspicion of malignancy, or both, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) may reduce unnecessary excisions without missing melanoma cases. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of reflectance confocal microscopy for the detection of cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants in adults with any lesion suspicious for melanoma and lesions that are difficult to diagnose, and to compare its accuracy with that of dermoscopy. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; and seven other databases. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Studies of any design that evaluated RCM alone, or RCM in comparison to dermoscopy, in adults with lesions suspicious for melanoma or atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants, compared with a reference standard of either histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). We contacted authors of included studies where information related to the target condition or diagnostic threshold were missing. We estimated summary sensitivities and specificities per algorithm and threshold using the bivariate hierarchical model. To compare RCM with dermoscopy, we grouped studies by population (defined by difficulty of lesion diagnosis) and combined data using hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) methods. Analysis of studies allowing direct comparison between tests was undertaken. To facilitate interpretation of results, we computed values of specificity at the point on the SROC curve with 90% sensitivity as this value lies within the estimates for the majority of analyses. We investigated the impact of using a purposely developed RCM algorithm and in‐person test interpretation. 
Main results
The search identified 18 publications reporting on 19 study cohorts with 2838 lesions (including 658 with melanoma), which provided 67 datasets for RCM and seven for dermoscopy. Studies were generally at high or unclear risk of bias across almost all domains and of high or unclear concern regarding applicability of the evidence. Selective participant recruitment, lack of blinding of the reference test to the RCM result, and differential verification were particularly problematic. Studies may not be representative of populations eligible for RCM, and test interpretation was often undertaken remotely from the patient and blinded to clinical information. 
Meta‐analysis found RCM to be more accurate than dermoscopy in studies of participants with any lesion suspicious for melanoma and in participants with lesions that were more difficult to diagnose (equivocal lesion populations). Assuming a fixed sensitivity of 90% for both tests, specificities were 82% for RCM and 42% for dermoscopy for any lesion suspicious for melanoma (9 RCM datasets; 1452 lesions and 370 melanomas). For a hypothetical population of 1000 lesions at the median observed melanoma prevalence of 30%, this equated to a reduction in unnecessary excisions with RCM of 280 compared to dermoscopy, with 30 melanomas missed by both tests. For studies in equivocal lesions, specificities of 86% would be observed for RCM and 49% for dermoscopy (7 RCM datasets; 1177 lesions and 180 melanomas). At the median observed melanoma prevalence of 20%, this reduced unnecessary excisions by 296 with RCM compared with dermoscopy, with 20 melanomas missed by both tests. Across all populations, algorithms and thresholds assessed, the sensitivity and specificity of the Pellacani RCM score at a threshold of three or greater were estimated at 92% (95% confidence interval (CI) 87 to 95) for RCM and 72% (95% CI 62 to 81) for dermoscopy.

RCM may have a potential role in clinical practice, particularly for the assessment of lesions that are difficult to diagnose using visual inspection and dermoscopy alone, where the evidence suggests that RCM may be both more sensitive and specific in comparison to dermoscopy. Given the paucity of data to allow comparison with dermoscopy, the results presented require further confirmation in prospective studies comparing RCM with dermoscopy in a real‐world setting in a representative population.

Is a Special Microscope Better at Finding Skin Cancer and Avoiding Unneeded Surgeries?

### **Rationale**

Melanoma is a serious type of skin cancer. More and more people are getting this cancer. While it is not the most common skin cancer, it causes the most deaths. Finding and treating melanoma early is the best way to save lives.

Doctors want to find every skin cancer. They worry about missing one. This means they often cut out many harmless skin spots just to be safe. This can lead to surgeries and scars that people may not need.

Researchers in this study wanted to find a better way. They looked at a special tool called reflectance confocal microscopy, or RCM. RCM is a powerful microscope that lets doctors see under the skin without cutting. The study asked if using RCM is better at finding melanoma than the tool doctors use now. The goal was to see if RCM could help doctors avoid cutting out harmless spots, while still finding all the dangerous ones.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, the researchers looked for all the past studies that had already been done on this topic. They combined the results of these past studies to get a stronger answer.

The researchers searched for studies that tested RCM. The studies included adults who had a skin spot that a doctor thought might be cancer. Some of these spots were very hard to diagnose just by looking at them.

In total, the researchers found 18 past studies to review. These studies included information from more than 2,800 skin spots. About 650 of these spots were melanoma. The researchers compared how well RCM worked to how well the usual tool, a special magnifying glass called a dermoscope, worked.

### **Results**

The review of the studies showed that RCM was more accurate than the usual tool for checking skin spots. RCM was better at telling the difference between a harmful cancer spot and a harmless spot. This was true for all types of suspicious spots, including those that were very difficult to diagnose.

Because RCM is more accurate, it could help many patients avoid unneeded surgeries. For example, imagine doctors check 1,000 skin spots, and 300 of them are actually skin cancer.
*   Both the new tool (RCM) and the usual tool would still miss about 30 of the 300 cancers.
*   But, for the 700 harmless spots, the usual tool would lead to many unneeded surgeries.
*   By using RCM, doctors could avoid about 280 of these unneeded surgeries compared to the usual tool.

The authors of the study concluded that RCM is a very promising tool. It could help doctors a lot, especially when they are not sure if a spot is cancer. However, they also said that we need more research. New studies should test RCM in real-world clinics to confirm that it helps patients.","What is the diagnostic accuracy of the imaging test reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) for the detection of melanoma in adults? 
What was the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) was on its own and used in addition to dermoscopy compared to dermoscopy alone for diagnosing melanoma. Review authors in Cochrane included 18 publications to answer this question. 
Why is improving the diagnosis of melanoma important? 
Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer. Not recognising a melanoma when it is present (called a false negative test result) delays surgery to remove it, risking cancer spreading to other parts in the body and possibly death. Diagnosing a skin lesion as a melanoma when it is not present (called a false positive result) may result in unnecessary surgery, further investigations, and patient anxiety. 
What did the review study? 
Microscopic techniques are used by skin cancer specialists to allow a more detailed, magnified examination of suspicious skin lesions than can be achieved using the naked eye alone. Currently, dermoscopy (a handheld device using natural light) can be used as part of the clinical examination of suspicious skin lesions. RCM is a new microscopic technique (a handheld device or static unit using infrared light) that can visualise deeper layers of the skin compared to dermoscopy. Both techniques are painless procedures, but RCM is more expensive, time consuming, and requires additional training. Dermoscopy can be used by general practitioners whereas RCM is likely to only be used by secondary care specialists in people who have been referred with a lesion suspicious for skin cancer. We sought to find out whether RCM should be used instead of, or in addition to, dermoscopy, to diagnose melanoma in any suspicious skin lesion or only in particularly difficult to diagnose skin lesions. 
What were the main results of the review? 
The review included 18 publications reporting data for 19 groups of participants with lesions suspected of melanoma. The main results were based on 16 of the 19 datasets (sets of information and results). 
The review included nine datasets with 1452 lesions in people with any suspicious skin lesion, three of which compared RCM to dermoscopy. The results suggested that in 1000 lesions, of which 300 (30%) actually are melanoma: 
‐ an estimated 396 would have an RCM result indicating melanoma was present, and of these, 126 (32%) would not be melanoma (false positive results); ‐ in the same group of 1000 lesions, dermoscopy would produce 406 false positive results, meaning RCM would avoid unnecessary surgery in 280 lesions compared to dermoscopy; ‐ of the 604 lesions with an RCM result indicating that melanoma was not present (and 324 lesions with a dermoscopy result indicating that melanoma was not present), 30 would actually be melanoma (false negative results). This equated to a false negative rate of 5% for RCM and 9% for dermoscopy. 
The review also included seven datasets with 1177 lesions in people with particularly difficult to diagnose skin lesions, three of which compared RCM to dermoscopy. The results suggested that if skin specialists used RCM in a group of 1000 lesions, of which 200 (20%) were actually melanoma: 
‐ an estimated 292 would have an RCM result indicating melanoma was present, and of these, 112 (38%) would not be melanoma (false positive results); ‐ in the same group of 1000 lesions, dermoscopy would produce 408 false positive results, meaning RCM would avoid unnecessary surgery in 296 lesions compared to dermoscopy; ‐ of the 708 lesions with an RCM result indicating that melanoma was not present (and 412 lesions with a dermoscopy result indicating that melanoma was not present), 20 would actually have melanoma (false negative results). This equates to a false negative rate of 3% for RCM and 5% for dermoscopy. 
How reliable were the results of the studies of this review? 
In all included studies, the diagnosis of melanoma was made by lesion biopsy (RCM/dermoscopy positive) (a biopsy involves taking a sample of body cells and examining them under a microscope), and the absence of melanoma was confirmed by biopsy or by follow‐up over time to make sure the skin lesion remained negative for melanoma (RCM/dermoscopy negative)*. This is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether people really had melanoma. Only a small number of studies compared the accuracy of dermoscopy and RCM. Most were conducted by specialist research teams with high levels of experience with RCM. Therefore, RCM may have appeared more accurate than it actually was. Participants in the nine studies of any suspicious lesion may have had very obvious disease compared to that seen in practice leading to a lower number of false positive results than would actually occur. It is not possible to recommend a definition of a positive RCM test that will reliably produce the results presented here due to differences between studies. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Eleven studies were undertaken in Europe (61%), with the remainder undertaken in Oceania, North America, or more than one continent. Mean age ranged from 39 to 54.7 years. The percentage of people with melanoma ranged between 1.9% and 41.5% (a median (midpoint reading) of 19% for difficult to diagnose skin lesions and 32% for any suspicious lesion). The majority of studies only included people with certain types of skin lesion. In many studies, it was not clear what tests participants had received before RCM. 
What are the implications of this review? 
RCM appears to be an accurate test for identifying melanoma, and it may reduce the number of people receiving unnecessary surgery by up to three‐quarters compared to dermoscopy. There is considerable variation and uncertainty in results and in study conduct, reducing the reliability of findings. Use of RCM may be of most benefit in people with particularly difficult to diagnose lesions rather than people with any lesion suspicious for melanoma. Further research comparing RCM and dermoscopy in well described groups of people with difficult to diagnose skin lesions is needed. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies, biopsy or clinical follow‐up were the reference standards (means of establishing final diagnoses).

Looking for the Best Treatments for Nose and Sinus Problems in People with Cystic Fibrosis

### **Rationale**

**What is the health problem?**

Cystic fibrosis is a health problem that people are born with. It makes some fluids in the body very thick and sticky, like glue. This thick fluid can get stuck in the nose and in the small spaces in the face around the nose. These spaces are called sinuses.

When this happens, it can cause long-term swelling and stuffiness. This problem is called chronic rhinosinusitis. It can make it hard to breathe through your nose. It can also be painful and uncomfortable. For people with cystic fibrosis, this can sometimes lead to more serious lung problems.

**Why did we do this study?**

People with cystic fibrosis are living longer and healthier lives. But this means more people have time to develop these long-term nose and sinus problems. Doctors want to find the best way to treat this condition. They think that treating it early could help people with cystic fibrosis feel much better.

There are a few types of medicines that might help. These include drugs that fight germs, drugs that reduce swelling, and drugs that thin the thick fluid. There are also new drugs that help the body work in a better way for people with cystic fibrosis. But right now, doctors do not have clear rules to follow. They do not know which treatment is best. This review of past studies tried to find out.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a study where patients tried a new medicine. Instead, the researchers looked for all the studies that were already done on this topic. They wanted to bring all the results together to find the best answers. This type of study is called a review.

The researchers looked for studies about people of any age with cystic fibrosis. The people in the studies also had to have long-term nose and sinus problems. Because this was a review of past studies, no new patients took part in this work. This means there was no time needed from patients.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The researchers looked very hard for studies that could answer their question. After searching, they could not find any studies that fit their rules. This means that right now, there is not enough proof from research to show which treatment is best for nose and sinus problems in people with cystic fibrosis. The researchers did find one study that is happening now, but its results are not ready yet.

**How does this study help patients?**

While this review did not find a best treatment, it is still very important. It shows that doctors and scientists need to do more research on this common problem. The people who did this review concluded that new studies are needed to find answers.

These new studies should be well-designed to test the different treatments. The results will help doctors and patients make the best choices for their care. The main goal is to improve the quality of life for people with cystic fibrosis and to help protect their lungs from other problems.","Medical interventions for chronic inflammation of the nose and sinuses in cystic fibrosis

A Review of Studies: Does Extra Medicine Help a Past Glaucoma Surgery Work After a Cataract Operation?

**Rationale**

Glaucoma and cataracts are two common eye problems. They can make it hard to see and affect a person's life.

Glaucoma is a disease that hurts a nerve in the back of your eye. This nerve is called the optic nerve. It sends messages from your eye to your brain so you can see. Glaucoma happens when the pressure inside your eye gets too high. This high pressure can harm the optic nerve. Any sight you lose from glaucoma cannot be brought back. The main goal of treatment is to lower the eye pressure to protect your sight.

Doctors may first use eye drops or lasers to treat glaucoma. If these do not work well enough, a person may need an eye surgery. One type of surgery is called a trabeculectomy. In this surgery, a doctor makes a tiny hole in the white part of the eye. This new hole lets extra fluid drain out of the eye. This helps to lower the pressure.

Many people with glaucoma also get cataracts. A cataract is when the clear lens inside your eye becomes cloudy. This makes your vision blurry. The only way to fix a cataract is with surgery to remove the cloudy lens.

A problem can happen when a person who has had a trabeculectomy needs cataract surgery. The eye's natural healing after cataract surgery can create scar tissue. This scar tissue can block the tiny drain hole made during the trabeculectomy. If the hole is blocked, the glaucoma surgery will stop working, and the eye pressure may go up again.

This review wanted to see if using extra medicine during cataract surgery could help. The main question was: Does this medicine stop scar tissue from blocking the drain hole? Researchers wanted to find out if this would help the first glaucoma surgery keep working.

**Trial Design**

This was not a new study with patients. Instead, the researchers looked for studies that were already finished. This is called a review.

The researchers looked for a special type of study. These are called randomized controlled trials. These studies give the best proof about whether a treatment works.

In this type of study, people are put into different groups by chance. It is like flipping a coin. One group gets the new treatment. The other group gets the old treatment or no treatment. This helps to make a fair comparison.

The researchers wanted to find studies that included adults who had two things in common. First, they had a working trabeculectomy surgery for their glaucoma. Second, they all needed to have cataract surgery.

In these studies, one group of patients would have received extra medicine during their cataract surgery. The other group would have received no extra medicine. By comparing the groups, we could learn if the medicine was helpful.

**Results**

The researchers looked for these special studies but could not find any. After a careful search, they found no randomized controlled trials that matched what they were looking for.

This means we do not know if using extra medicine during cataract surgery is helpful. There is no strong proof from studies to say that it works. We cannot be sure if the medicine helps keep the glaucoma drain hole open or not.

The researchers who did this review concluded that we need more research. Good studies need to be done on this topic. These new studies would help doctors and patients make better choices about treatment. This would help us know the best way to care for people who need cataract surgery after a glaucoma surgery.

10.1002-14651858.CD013196.pub2,"Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, including bronchitis and emphysema) is a chronic condition causing shortness of breath, cough, and exacerbations leading to poor health outcomes. Face‐to‐face visits with health professionals can be hindered by severity of COPD or frailty, and by people living at a distance from their healthcare provider and having limited access to services. Telehealth technologies aimed at providing health care remotely through monitoring and consultations could help to improve health outcomes of people with COPD. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of telehealth interventions that allow remote monitoring and consultation and multi‐component interventions for reducing exacerbations and improving quality of life, while reducing dyspnoea symptoms, hospital service utilisation, and death among people with COPD. 
Search methods
We identified studies from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register. Additional sources searched included the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the IEEEX Xplore Digital Library. The latest search was conducted in April 2020. We used the GRADE approach to judge the certainty of evidence for outcomes. 
Selection criteria
Eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included adults with diagnosed COPD. Asthma, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and other respiratory conditions were excluded. Interventions included remote monitoring or consultation plus usual care, remote monitoring or consultation alone, and mult‐component interventions from all care settings. Quality of life scales included St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the COPD Assessment Test (CAT). The dyspnoea symptom scale used was the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire Self‐Administered Standardized Scale (CRQ‐SAS). 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We assessed confidence in the evidence for each primary outcome using the GRADE method. Primary outcomes were exacerbations, quality of life, dyspnoea symptoms, hospital service utilisation, and mortality; a secondary outcome consisted of adverse events. 
Main results
We included 29 studies in the review (5654 participants; male proportion 36% to 96%; female proportion 4% to 61%). Most remote monitoring interventions required participants to transfer measurements using a remote device and later health professional review (asynchronous). Only five interventions transferred data and allowed review by health professionals in real time (synchronous). Studies were at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, and certainty of evidence ranged from moderate to very low. We found no evidence on comparison of remote consultations with or without usual care. 
Remote monitoring plus usual care (8 studies, 1033 participants)  
Very uncertain evidence suggests that remote monitoring plus usual care may have little to no effect on the number of people experiencing exacerbations at 26 weeks or 52 weeks. There may be little to no difference in effect on quality of life (SGRQ) at 26 weeks (very low to low certainty) or on hospitalisation (all‐cause or COPD‐related; very low certainty). COPD‐related hospital re‐admissions are probably reduced at 26 weeks (hazard ratio 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.93; 106 participants; moderate certainty). There may be little to no difference in deaths between intervention and usual care (very low certainty). We found no evidence for dyspnoea symptoms or adverse events. 
Remote monitoring alone (10 studies, 2456 participants)  
Very uncertain evidence suggests that remote monitoring may result in little to no effect on the number of people experiencing exacerbations at 41 weeks (odds ratio 1.02, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.55). There may be little to no effect on quality of life (SGRQ total at 17 weeks, or CAT at 38 and 52 weeks; very low certainty). There may be little to no effect on dyspnoea symptoms on the CRQ‐SAS at 26 weeks (low certainty). There may be no difference in effects on the number of people admitted to hospital (very low certainty) or on deaths (very low certainty). We found no evidence for adverse events. 
Multi‐component interventions with remote monitoring or consultation component (11 studies, 2165 participants)  
Very uncertain evidence suggests that multi‐component interventions may have little to no effect on the number of people experiencing exacerbations at 52 weeks. Quality of life at 13 weeks may improve as seen in SGRQ total score (mean difference ‐9.70, 95% CI ‐18.32 to ‐1.08; 38 participants; low certainty) but not at 26 or 52 weeks (very low certainty). COPD assessment test (CAT) scores may improve at a mean of 38 weeks, but evidence is very uncertain and interventions are varied. 
There may be little to no effect on the number of people admitted to hospital at 33 weeks (low certainty). Multi‐component interventions are likely to result in fewer people re‐admitted to hospital at a mean of 39 weeks (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.81; 344 participants, 3 studies; moderate certainty). There may be little to no difference in death at a mean of 40 weeks (very low certainty). There may be little to no effect on people experiencing adverse events (very low certainty). We found no evidence for dyspnoea symptoms. 
Authors' conclusions
Remote monitoring plus usual care provided asynchronously may not be beneficial overall compared to usual care alone. Some benefit is seen in reduction of COPD‐related hospital re‐admissions, but moderate‐certainty evidence is based on one study. We have not found any evidence for dyspnoea symptoms nor harms, and there is no difference in fatalities when remote monitoring is provided in addition to usual care. 
Remote monitoring interventions alone are no better than usual care overall for health outcomes. 
Multi‐component interventions with asynchronous remote monitoring are no better than usual care but may provide short‐term benefit for quality of life and may result in fewer re‐admissions to hospital for any cause. We are uncertain whether remote monitoring is responsible for the positive impact on re‐admissions, and we are unable to discern the long‐term benefits of receiving remote monitoring as part of patient care. 
Owing to paucity of evidence, it is unclear which COPD severity subgroups would benefit from telehealth interventions. Given there is no evidence of harm, telehealth interventions may be beneficial as an additional health resource depending on individual needs based on professional assessment. Larger studies can determine long‐term effects of these interventions.

Can Using Technology at Home Help People with Lung Disease (COPD)?

### **Rationale**
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, is a long-term lung disease. It can make it hard to breathe. People with COPD may have a cough that does not go away and often feel short of breath. Sometimes their symptoms get much worse for a short time. These are called flare-ups.

It can be hard for people with COPD to visit a doctor. They may be too sick or frail to travel. Or they may live far away from a clinic.

This study looked at telehealth. Telehealth is a way to get health care from your home. It uses technology like special devices, phones, or computers. Doctors and nurses can check on you and talk to you without you having to come to the clinic. Researchers wanted to know if telehealth could help people with COPD have fewer flare-ups and a better life.

### **Trial Design**
This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of 29 older studies. This helped them bring all the information together.

In total, the studies included about 5,600 adults who had been told they have COPD.

The researchers looked at three main ways telehealth was used:
1.  **Technology plus usual care:** People used a device at home to send health updates to their care team. They also had their normal doctor visits.
2.  **Technology alone:** People used a device at home to send health updates. This was compared to people who only had their normal doctor visits.
3.  **Programs with many parts:** People received a care program that included telehealth along with other types of support, like education or exercise plans.

The time people spent in these studies was different from one study to the next. It was often between 6 months and one year.

### **Results**
Here is what the researchers found when they looked at all the studies together.

**1. Using technology plus usual care**
The researchers were not very sure about these results. They found that adding technology to usual care may not have made a big difference. It did not seem to change the number of flare-ups people had. It also did not seem to change their quality of life or how many times they had to go to the hospital.

However, one study did show that people were less likely to go *back* to the hospital for their COPD after being sent home.

**2. Using technology alone**
The researchers were also not very sure about these results. They found that using technology alone did not seem to be better than usual care. It did not seem to help with flare-ups, quality of life, or shortness of breath. It also did not change the number of people who went to the hospital or who died.

**3. Using programs with many parts that included technology**
Again, the results were not very clear. These programs did not seem to reduce flare-ups over a year. They may have helped people feel better in their daily life for a short time (about 3 months).

These programs also seemed to help in one area. People in these programs were less likely to have to go *back* to the hospital for any reason.

**Main Conclusions from the Researchers**
*   Overall, using telehealth at home did not show a clear, strong benefit for most people with COPD.
*   The main possible benefit was that some types of telehealth may help lower the number of times people have to go back to the hospital.
*   The good news is that using telehealth did not seem to cause any harm.
*   The researchers believe that we need larger and better studies. This will help us learn if telehealth can help people with COPD in the long run.","Telehealth technologies for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
Review question 
Do telehealth technologies help improve the health of people who have COPD?
Background 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes a group of lung conditions that cause breathing difficulties. Symptoms include shortness of breath (dyspnoea), coughing, and increased mucus. COPD causes limited airflow in the lungs when breathing out; this can be measured by spirometry (a measure to assess how well the lungs function). The spirometer takes two measurements: volume of air when breathing out forcefully in one second, and total amount of air breathed out. When COPD gets worse over time, this leads to greater symptom severity and can reduce quality of life. Disease progression and sudden flare‐ups (exacerbations) of symptoms can increase someone's risks of hospitalisation and death. Telehealth technologies could improve delivery of health care for people with COPD, which could reduce exacerbations, improve quality of life, and lower rates of hospitalisation. However, it is unclear whether providing telehealth care improves health‐related outcomes for people with COPD. We wanted to explore whether telehealth technologies were helpful for people with COPD. 
What are telehealth technologies? 
Study investigators used a range of telehealth technologies. Some included remote monitoring technology, which requires daily use of a laptop or a tablet with monitoring equipment, with results received by the healthcare professional. Typical monitoring equipment included a stethoscope (to measure blood pressure and heart rate), a pulse oximeter (to measure oxygen levels in the blood), a spirometer (to measure lung function), a thermometer, and other devices. Interventions involved regular phone calls with healthcare professionals for patients to talk about their symptoms and completion of health questionnaires. 
Identifying and selecting studies 
We searched online databases up until April 2020. We searched for studies published worldwide, in any language, at any time. Two review authors looked at lists of studies separately, then agreed on which studies should be included. 
To find the best answer to our question, we looked for studies that recruited people with COPD of any severity. To make the comparison fair, we looked for studies in which investigators compared remote monitoring, remote monitoring plus usual care, and multi‐component treatments. People included in these studies had to have the same random chance (like the flip of a coin) to receive one of these teleheath technologies or usual care. 
Key results 
We found 29 studies (5654 people with moderate to very severe COPD) that were suitable for inclusion in our review. Duration of these studies ranged from 3 to 12 months. 
We did not find any important benefits or harms for patients who were monitored with any of the telehealth technologies when we looked at number of exacerbations, improvement in quality of life, and reduction in breathing distress symptoms, hospitalisations, or death. However, people who were monitored through telehealth technology plus usual care had some reduction in risk of hospital re‐admission. Thus, telehealth technologies that were part of a care package reduced COPD‐related hospital re‐admissions. 
We could not be certain of any harms of stand‐alone remote monitoring. We are also uncertain of any benefits or harms of stand‐alone remote monitoring of patient experiences or reports of breathing distress. 
Quality of evidence 
Currently, no good quality evidence is available. We are very uncertain about evidence for exacerbations, quality of life, dyspnoea symptoms, hospitalisations, deaths, and side effects. However, we are moderately certain about our findings for hospital re‐admissions. 
Conclusion 
We are not clear whether telehealth technologies for monitoring or consultation provide benefit, but we have not found any information on harms. Telehealth could play a role in the care and management of people with COPD. Telehealth as part of multi‐component care packages may provide short‐term benefit for quality of life and hospital re‐admissions. Telehealth in the form of remote monitoring in addition to usual care may reduce the risk of hospital re‐admission. There is little impact on exacerbations, quality of life, and death. Owing to limited information, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. More studies are needed to determine whether telehealth provides any long‐term benefits for people with COPD of varying severity.

Diet plays a major role in the aetiology of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and as a modifiable risk factor is the focus of many prevention strategies. Recently vegan diets have gained popularity and there is a need to synthesise existing clinical trial evidence for their potential in CVD prevention. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of following a vegan dietary pattern for the primary and secondary prevention of CVD. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases on 4 February 2020: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science Core Collection. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov in January 2021. We applied no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in healthy adults and adults at high risk of CVD (primary prevention) and those with established CVD (secondary prevention). A vegan dietary pattern excludes meat, fish, eggs, dairy and honey; the intervention could be dietary advice, provision of relevant foods, or both. The comparison group received either no intervention, minimal intervention, or another dietary intervention. Outcomes included clinical events and CVD risk factors. We included only studies with follow‐up periods of 12 weeks or more, defined as the intervention period plus post‐intervention follow‐up. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risks of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We conducted three main comparisons: 
1. Vegan dietary intervention versus no intervention or minimal intervention for primary prevention;2. Vegan dietary intervention versus another dietary intervention for primary prevention;3. Vegan dietary intervention versus another dietary intervention for secondary prevention. 
Main results
Thirteen RCTs (38 papers, 7 trial registrations) and eight ongoing trials met our inclusion criteria. Most trials contributed to primary prevention: comparisons 1 (four trials, 466 participants randomised) and comparison 2 (eight trials, 409 participants randomised). We included only one secondary prevention trial for comparison 3 (63 participants randomised). 
None of the trials reported on clinical endpoints. Other primary outcomes included lipid levels and blood pressure. 
For comparison 1 there was moderate‐certainty evidence from four trials with 449 participants that a vegan diet probably led to a small reduction in total cholesterol (mean difference (MD) −0.24 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.36 to −0.12) and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (MD −0.22 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.32 to −0.11), a very small decrease in high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) levels (MD −0.08 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.11 to −0.04) and a very small increase in triglyceride levels (MD 0.11 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.21). The very small changes in HDL and triglyceride levels are in the opposite direction to that expected. There was a lack of evidence for an effect with the vegan dietary intervention on systolic blood pressure (MD 0.94 mmHg, 95% CI −1.18 to 3.06; 3 trials, 374 participants) and diastolic blood pressure (MD −0.27 mmHg, 95% CI −1.67 to 1.12; 3 trials, 372 participants) (low‐certainty evidence). 
For comparison 2 there was a lack of evidence for an effect of the vegan dietary intervention on total cholesterol levels (MD −0.04 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.28 to 0.20; 4 trials, 163 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There was probably little or no effect of the vegan dietary intervention on LDL (MD −0.05 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.21 to 0.11; 4 trials, 244 participants) or HDL cholesterol levels (MD −0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.08 to 0.05; 5 trials, 256 participants) or triglycerides (MD 0.21 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.07 to 0.49; 5 trials, 256 participants) compared to other dietary interventions (moderate‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about any effect of the vegan dietary intervention on systolic blood pressure (MD 0.02 mmHg, 95% CI −3.59 to 3.62)  or diastolic blood pressure (MD 0.63 mmHg, 95% CI −1.54 to 2.80; 5 trials, 247 participants (very low‐certainty evidence)). 
Only one trial (63 participants) contributed to comparison 3, where there was a lack of evidence for an effect of the vegan dietary intervention on lipid levels or blood pressure compared to other dietary interventions (low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence). 
Four trials reported on adverse events, which were absent or minor.
Authors' conclusions
Studies were generally small with few participants contributing to each comparison group. None of the included studies report on CVD clinical events. There is currently insufficient information to draw conclusions about the effects of vegan dietary interventions on CVD risk factors. The eight ongoing studies identified will add to the evidence base, with all eight reporting on primary prevention. There is a paucity of evidence for secondary prevention.

Can a Vegan Diet Help Prevent Heart and Blood Vessel Disease?

### **Rationale**

Heart and blood vessel disease, also called cardiovascular disease, is a serious health problem. The food we eat plays a big role in our heart health. Changing our diet is one way we can lower our risk of getting this disease.

Lately, many people have become interested in vegan diets. A vegan diet does not include any animal products. This means no meat, fish, eggs, or milk products like cheese.

Researchers wanted to know if eating a vegan diet could help keep people’s hearts healthy. They looked at past studies to see what the proof says. This review helps us understand if a vegan diet is a good choice for preventing heart disease.

### **Trial Design**

This was a review study. This means the researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they gathered all the best studies that had already been done on this topic. They looked for studies called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, people are put into groups by chance to compare different treatments. This is the best way to see if something works.

The researchers looked at 13 studies in total. The people in these studies were adults. Some were healthy. Some were at high risk for heart disease. A few people already had heart disease.

In each study, one group of people followed a vegan diet. Another group either made no changes to their diet or followed a different type of diet. All the studies lasted for 3 months or more. This gave researchers time to see if the diets made a difference.

### **Results**

The studies were mostly small. None of them looked at whether people on a vegan diet had fewer heart attacks or strokes. Instead, they looked at risk factors for heart disease. These are things like cholesterol and blood pressure. Cholesterol is a fatty substance in your blood. Too much ""bad"" cholesterol can harm your heart.

**For people at risk of heart disease:**

*   When a vegan diet was compared to making no diet changes, it seemed to help a little. The vegan diet lowered total cholesterol and ""bad"" cholesterol by a small amount.
*   But it also lowered ""good"" cholesterol a very small amount. ""Good"" cholesterol helps protect the heart. Researchers were fairly sure about these results. They were not sure if the vegan diet had any effect on blood pressure.
*   When a vegan diet was compared to other types of diets, there was no clear difference. The vegan diet did not seem to be better or worse for cholesterol or blood pressure.

**For people who already had heart disease:**

*   Only one very small study looked at this group. There was not enough information to know if a vegan diet helped them.

**Main Conclusions from the Researchers:**

Overall, there is not enough proof to say for sure if a vegan diet can prevent heart disease. The studies were too small to give a clear answer.

The researchers did not find any major side effects from the vegan diets. We need more and bigger studies to learn more. There are eight new studies on this topic happening now. They will give us more information in the future.","Vegan diets for the prevention of cardiovascular disease
Background 
It is well known that diet plays a major role in cardiovascular disease risk. This review assesses the effects of providing dietary advice to follow a vegan diet (excluding all meat, fish, eggs, dairy and honey) or providing foods relevant to the diet (or both) to healthy adults, to people at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and to those with cardiovascular disease, in order to prevent new or recurrent cardiovascular disease, and to reduce the risk factors associated with it. 
Study characteristics 
We searched key databases of medical studies up to February 2020 and found 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (in 38 papers) that met our criteria. We grouped studies into the following three categories to help us with our interpretation of the results: 
1. Vegan dietary intervention compared to no intervention or a minimal intervention to prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease;2. Vegan dietary intervention compared to another dietary intervention to prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease;3. Vegan dietary intervention compared to another dietary intervention for people with existing cardiovascular disease, to prevent recurrence. 
Key results 
None of the trials reported on the occurrence of cardiovascular disease either in those with or without disease to begin with. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease were reported in the included studies. There was moderate‐certainty evidence for some small reductions in lipid levels with the vegan diet compared to no or minimal intervention in people without disease, but also some very small changes in measures in the opposite direction for cardiovascular benefit. In people who already had cardiovascular disease there was very limited information, as only one trial met our criteria. Four trials reported on side effects of the diet, which were either absent or minor. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Most studies had limitations in study design, so the evidence should be interpreted cautiously. In particular, the overall number of people who took part in the studies was too small to rule out the possibility of chance findings, and too small to pick up any differences in effect on our measures. 
Conclusions 
The review concludes that there is no information currently about the effects of a vegan diet on cardiovascular disease occurrence. There is limited information on the effects of the diet on those who already have cardiovascular disease, and mixed results about risk factors for those without disease. We found eight studies that are still ongoing, and when we have the results from these we will incorporate them into the review to help reduce the uncertainty.

10.1002-14651858.CD013172.pub2,"Background
Carotid artery stenosis is an important cause of stroke and transient ischemic attack. Correctly and rapidly identifying patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis is essential for adequate treatment with early cerebral revascularization. Doubts about the diagnostic value regarding the accuracy of duplex ultrasound (DUS) and the possibility of using DUS as the single diagnostic test before carotid revascularization are still debated. 
Objectives
To estimate the accuracy of DUS in individuals with symptomatic carotid stenosis verified by either digital subtraction angiography (DSA), computed tomography angiography (CTA), or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). 
Search methods
We searched CRDTAS, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), ISI Web of Science, HTA, DARE, and LILACS up to 15 February 2021. We handsearched the reference lists of all included studies and other relevant publications and contacted experts in the field to identify additional studies or unpublished data. 
Selection criteria
We included studies assessing DUS accuracy against an acceptable reference standard (DSA, MRA, or CTA) in symptomatic patients. We considered the classification of carotid stenosis with DUS defined with validated duplex velocity criteria, and the NASCET criteria for carotid stenosis measures on DSA, MRA, and CTA. We excluded studies that included < 70% of symptomatic patients; the time between the index test and the reference standard was longer than four weeks or not described, or that presented no objective criteria to estimate carotid stenosis. 
Data collection and analysis
The review authors independently screened articles, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias and applicability concerns using the QUADAS‐2 domain list. We extracted data with an effort to complete a 2 × 2 table (true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives) for each of the different categories of carotid stenosis and reference standards. We produced forest plots and summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots to summarize the data. Where meta‐analysis was possible, we used a bivariate meta‐analysis model. 
Main results
We identified 25,087 unique studies, of which 22 were deemed eligible for inclusion (4957 carotid arteries). The risk of bias varied considerably across the studies, and studies were generally of moderate to low quality. We narratively described the results without meta‐analysis in seven studies in which the criteria used to determine stenosis were too different from the duplex velocity criteria proposed in our protocol or studies that provided insufficient data to complete a 2 × 2 table for at least in one category of stenosis. Nine studies (2770 carotid arteries) presented DUS versus DSA results for 70% to 99% carotid artery stenosis, and two (685 carotid arteries) presented results from DUS versus CTA in this category. Seven studies presented results for occlusion with DSA as the reference standard and three with CTA as the reference standard. Five studies compared DUS versus DSA for 50% to 99% carotid artery stenosis. Only one study presented results from 50% to 69% carotid artery stenosis. 
For DUS versus DSA, for < 50% carotid artery stenosis, the summary sensitivity was 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48 to 0.76) and the summary specificity was 0.99 (95% CI 0.96 to 0.99); for the 50% to 69% range, only one study was included and meta‐analysis not performed; for the 50% to 99% range, the summary sensitivity was 0.97 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.98) and the summary specificity was 0.70 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.73); for the 70% to 99% range, the summary sensitivity was 0.85 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.91) and the summary specificity was 0.98 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.90); for occlusion, the summary sensitivity was 0.91 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.97) and the summary specificity was 0.95 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.99). 
For sensitivity analyses, excluding studies in which participants were selected based on the presence of occlusion on DUS had an impact on specificity: 0.98 (95% CI 0.97 to 0.99). For DUS versus CTA, we found two studies in the range of 70% to 99%; the sensitivity varied from 0.57 to 0.94 and the specificity varied from 0.87 to 0.98. For occlusion, the summary sensitivity was 0.95 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.99) and the summary specificity was 0.91 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.99). For DUS versus MRA, there was one study with results for 50% to 99% carotid artery stenosis, with a sensitivity of 0.88 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.98) and specificity of 0.60 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.95); in the 70% to 99% range, two studies were included, with sensitivity that varied from 0.54 to 0.99 and specificity that varied from 0.78 to 0.89. We could perform only a few of the proposed sensitivity analyses because of the small number of studies included. 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides evidence that the diagnostic accuracy of DUS is high, especially at discriminating between the presence or absence of significant carotid artery stenosis (< 50% or 50% to 99%). This evidence, plus its less invasive nature, supports the early use of DUS for the detection of carotid artery stenosis. The accuracy for 70% to 99% carotid artery stenosis and occlusion is high. Clinicians should exercise caution when using DUS as the single preoperative diagnostic method, and the limitations should be considered. There was little evidence of the accuracy of DUS when compared with CTA or MRA. The results of this review should be interpreted with caution because they are based on studies of low methodological quality, mainly due to the patient selection method. Methodological problems in participant inclusion criteria from the studies discussed above apparently influenced an overestimated estimate of prevalence values. Most of the studies included failed to precisely describe inclusion criteria and previous testing. Future diagnostic accuracy studies should include direct comparisons of the various modalities of diagnostic tests (mainly DUS, CTA, and MRA) for carotid artery stenosis since DSA is no longer considered to be the best method for diagnosing carotid stenosis and less invasive tests are now used as reference standards in clinical practice. Also, for future studies, the participant inclusion criteria require careful attention.

How good is an ultrasound test for finding blocked neck arteries that can cause a stroke?

**Rationale**
The main arteries in your neck are called the carotid arteries. They send blood to your brain. Sometimes, these arteries can get narrow or blocked with a buildup of fatty plaque. This is a serious condition. It can stop blood from getting to the brain and cause a stroke or a mini-stroke. A stroke can cause lasting harm. It can change how you move, speak, or think.

To prevent a stroke, doctors need to find these blockages quickly. This helps people get the right treatment, which may include surgery to clear the artery. One common test to find blockages is called a duplex ultrasound, or DUS. This test uses sound waves to create a picture of your arteries. It is simple, safe, and does not use any radiation. It is like the test used to see a baby in the womb.

However, some doctors are not sure how accurate this ultrasound test is. They wonder if it is good enough to be the only test used before a patient has surgery. This study was done to find out. The researchers wanted to know how well the ultrasound test finds blocked neck arteries.

**Trial Design**
The researchers did not test new patients for this study. Instead, they looked for all the past studies that had already been done on this topic. This type of study is called a review. It helps combine the results from many smaller studies to get a better answer.

The researchers searched for studies that included people with stroke symptoms. These studies had to compare the ultrasound test (DUS) to other, more detailed tests. These other tests are called CTA, MRA, and DSA. They are other types of medical scans that take pictures of the blood vessels. They are often seen as the standard for finding blockages.

The researchers carefully reviewed thousands of studies. They chose 22 studies that met their rules. These studies included information from almost 5,000 people who had their neck arteries checked.

**Results**
The review found that the duplex ultrasound (DUS) test is good at finding serious blockages in the neck arteries. The test was very good at telling the difference between arteries that had a major blockage and arteries that did not.

Here is what the results showed when the ultrasound was compared to the standard DSA test:
*   For finding a major blockage (when the artery is half-blocked or more), the test was very accurate. If 100 people had this type of blockage, the ultrasound test correctly found it in 97 of them.
*   For finding a very serious blockage (when the artery is more than two-thirds blocked), the test was also good. If 100 people had this blockage, the ultrasound found it in about 85 of them.
*   The test was also good at finding a full blockage of the artery.

These results show that the ultrasound test is a helpful tool. Since it is safe and easy, it is a good test to use first when a doctor thinks someone might have a blocked neck artery.

However, the researchers who did the study also gave a word of warning. They found that many of the 22 studies they looked at were not of the highest quality. The way these past studies were done may have made the ultrasound test seem more accurate than it really is. Because of this, doctors should be careful. The ultrasound test is a good starting point, but it may not be the only test a person needs before surgery to clear a blocked artery. More and better studies are needed in the future to be sure.","How accurate is duplex ultrasound (DUS) imaging for diagnosing carotid artery stenosis in symptomatic patients? 
Carotid artery stenosis (CAS) is a narrowing of the lumen (the inside space) of the carotid artery (usually due to cholesterol deposits called plaque). CAS is responsible for 8% of all strokes due to a blocked blood vessel (ischemic strokes) and is associated with a high chance of recurrence. In such circumstances, the treatment is to re‐establish adequate blood flow (by surgery or other approaches to open the artery) to prevent further neurologic episodes. Duplex ultrasound (DUS) can help identify the appropriate patients who will benefit from a more invasive treatment and those who should be with drugs alone. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To determine how accurate DUS is for diagnosing different grades of CAS in individuals with neurologic symptoms. 
What was studied in the review? 
DUS is used in clinical practice as the first test to detect carotid artery stenosis, usually with the result confirmed by other more expensive and invasive tests, such as computed tomography angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), or digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The advantage of DUS is that it is less expensive and helps to reduce the time required to select patients for treatment. We included studies assessing the accuracy of DUS compared with DSA, MRA, or CTA in patients with recent stroke symptoms. We grouped the results from studies that used approximately the same method and threshold to assess accuracy in the following categories of carotid artery stenosis: < 50%, 50% to 99%, 50% to 69%, 70% to 99%, and occlusion (blockage of the vessel). 
What are the main results of this review? 
This review included 22 studies (4957 carotid arteries tested). The searches were performed up to 15 February 2021. The results indicate the following: If DUS were to be used in a standardized cohort of 1000 patients: 
For DUS versus DSA  
< 50% CAS (4 studies, 1495 carotid arteries): Estimated 299 patients would have a DUS result indicating the presence of non‐significant CAS, of whom eight (2.7%) would be incorrectly classified. Of the 701 people with a result indicating that < 50% carotid stenosis is not present, 169 (24.1%) would be incorrectly classified. 
50% to 99% CAS (5 studies, 1536 carotid arteries): Estimated 642 patients would have a DUS result indicating the presence of 50% to 99% CAS; of these, 147 (22.8%) would be incorrectly classified. Of the 358 people with a result indicating that 50% to 99% carotid stenosis is not present, 15 (4.2%) would be incorrectly classified. 
70% to 99% CAS (9 studies, 2770 carotid arteries): Estimated 390 patients would have a DUS result indicating the presence of 70% to 99% CAS; of these, eight (2%) would be incorrectly classified. Of the 610 people with a result indicating that 70% to 99% carotid stenosis is not present, 68 (11.1%) would be incorrectly classified. 
Occlusion (7 studies, 1212 carotid arteries): Estimated 205 patients would have a DUS result indicating carotid artery occlusion; of these, 41 (20%) would be incorrectly classified. Of the 795 people with a result indicating that carotid occlusion is not present, 16 (2%) would be incorrectly classified. 
For DUS versus CTA  
Occlusion (3 studies, 833 carotid arteries): An estimated 606 patients would have a DUS result indicating carotid artery occlusion; of these, 36 (6%) would be incorrectly classified. 394 people with a result indicating that carotid occlusion is not present, 30 (8%) would be incorrectly classified. 
For DUS versus MRA  
Meta‐analysis was not performed.
How reliable are the results of the studies in this review? 
There were some problems with how the studies were conducted that could impair the correct estimates of the diagnostic accuracy. Many of the studies were of poor or unclear quality. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
The results are relevant for patients with neurologic symptoms who are suspected of having carotid artery stenosis. 
What are the implications of this review? 
The diagnostic accuracy of DUS is high, especially at discriminating between the presence or absence of significant carotid artery stenosis. This evidence, plus its less invasive nature, supports the early use of DUS for the detection of carotid artery stenosis.

10.1002-14651858.CD013679,"Background
The global burden of poor maternal, neonatal, and child health (MNCH) accounts for more than a quarter of healthy years of life lost worldwide. Targeted client communication (TCC) via mobile devices (MD) (TCCMD) may be a useful strategy to improve MNCH. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of TCC via MD on health behaviour, service use, health, and well‐being for MNCH. 
Search methods
In July/August 2017, we searched five databases including The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and Embase. We also searched two trial registries. A search update was carried out in July 2019 and potentially relevant studies are awaiting classification. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials that assessed TCC via MD to improve MNCH behaviour, service use, health, and well‐being. Eligible comparators were usual care/no intervention, non‐digital TCC, and digital non‐targeted client communication. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane, although data extraction and risk of bias assessments were carried out by one person only and cross‐checked by a second. 
Main results
We included 27 trials (17,463 participants). Trial populations were: pregnant and postpartum women (11 trials conducted in low‐, middle‐ or high‐income countries (LMHIC); pregnant and postpartum women living with HIV (three trials carried out in one lower middle‐income country); and parents of children under the age of five years (13 trials conducted in LMHIC). Most interventions (18) were delivered via text messages alone, one was delivered through voice calls only, and the rest were delivered through combinations of different communication channels, such as multimedia messages and voice calls. 
Pregnant and postpartum women 
TCCMD versus standard care 
For behaviours, TCCMD may increase exclusive breastfeeding in settings where rates of exclusive breastfeeding are less common (risk ratio (RR) 1.30, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.06 to 1.59; low‐certainty evidence), but have little or no effect in settings where almost all women breastfeed (low‐certainty evidence). For use of health services, TCCMD may increase antenatal appointment attendance (odds ratio (OR) 1.54, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.96; low‐certainty evidence); however, the CI encompasses both benefit and harm. The intervention may increase skilled attendants at birth in settings where a lack of skilled attendants at birth is common (though this differed by urban/rural residence), but may make no difference in settings where almost all women already have a skilled attendant at birth (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.94; low‐certainty evidence). There were uncertain effects on maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity because the certainty of the evidence was assessed as very low. 
TCCMD versus non‐digital TCC (e.g. pamphlets) 
TCCMD may have little or no effect on exclusive breastfeeding (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.07; low‐certainty evidence). TCCMD may reduce 'any maternal health problem' (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.79) and 'any newborn health problem' (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.06) reported up to 10 days postpartum (low‐certainty evidence), though the CI for the latter includes benefit and harm. The effect on health service use is unknown due to a lack of studies. 
TCCMD versus digital non‐targeted communication 
No studies reported behavioural, health, or well‐being outcomes for this comparison. For use of health services, there are uncertain effects for the presence of a skilled attendant at birth due to very low‐certainty evidence, and the intervention may make little or no difference to attendance for antenatal influenza vaccination (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.58), though the CI encompasses both benefit and harm (low‐certainty evidence). 
Pregnant and postpartum women living with HIV 
TCCMD versus standard care 
For behaviours, TCCMD may make little or no difference to maternal and infant adherence to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy (low‐certainty evidence). For health service use, TCC mobile telephone reminders may increase use of antenatal care slightly (mean difference (MD) 1.5, 95% CI –0.36 to 3.36; low‐certainty evidence). The effect on the proportion of births occurring in a health facility is uncertain due to very low‐certainty evidence. For health and well‐being outcomes, there was an uncertain intervention effect on neonatal death or stillbirth, and infant HIV due to very low‐certainty evidence. No studies reported on maternal mortality or morbidity. 
TCCMD versus non‐digital TCC 
The effect is unknown due to lack of studies reporting this comparison.
TCCMD versus digital non‐targeted communication 
TCCMD may increase infant ARV/prevention of mother‐to‐child transmission treatment adherence (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.48; low‐certainty evidence). The effect on other outcomes is unknown due to lack of studies. 
Parents of children aged less than five years 
No studies reported on correct treatment, nutritional, or health outcomes.
TCCMD versus standard care 
Based on 10 trials, TCCMD may modestly increase health service use (vaccinations and HIV care) (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.34; low‐certainty evidence); however, the effect estimates varied widely between studies. 
TCCMD versus non‐digital TCC 
TCCMD may increase attendance for vaccinations (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.28; low‐certainty evidence), and may make little or no difference to oral hygiene practices (low‐certainty evidence). 
TCCMD versus digital non‐targeted communication 
TCCMD may reduce attendance for vaccinations, but the CI encompasses both benefit and harm (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.20; low‐certainty evidence). 
No trials in any population reported data on unintended consequences.

The effect of TCCMD for most outcomes is uncertain. There may be improvements for some outcomes using targeted communication but these findings were of low certainty. High‐quality, adequately powered trials and cost‐effectiveness analyses are required to reliably ascertain the effects and relative benefits of TCCMD. Future studies should measure potential unintended consequences, such as partner violence or breaches of confidentiality.

Can Mobile Phone Messages Help Keep Mothers and Children Healthy? A Review of 27 Studies

### **Rationale**

The health of mothers, newborns, and young children is very important. Around the world, many families face health problems during pregnancy and early childhood. This can cause a lot of pain and sadness. We need to find simple ways to help mothers and their children stay healthy.

Most people have a mobile phone. Researchers thought that sending health messages and reminders to mobile phones could be a good way to help. These messages could give people useful health tips. They could also remind them to go to their doctor’s appointments.

This study looked at all the research that has been done on this topic. The main goal was to see if sending health messages to mobile phones really helps mothers and children. Researchers wanted to know if this is a good way to improve their health and well-being.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers gathered the results from 27 past studies. This allowed them to look at all the information together.

In total, more than 17,000 people took part in these 27 studies. The people in the studies were in three main groups:
*   Pregnant women and new mothers.
*   Pregnant women and new mothers who were living with HIV. HIV is a virus that can cause serious illness.
*   Parents of children under 5 years old.

In these studies, some people were sent health messages. Most of the time, these were text messages. Other times, they were voice calls or a mix of different types of messages.

To see if the messages worked, the researchers in each study made different groups. One group got the mobile phone messages. Another group did not. The other group got the usual health care, or they got health information on paper, like a pamphlet. The studies then compared the health of the different groups.

### **Results**

The researchers found that the results from the 27 studies were not very clear. For most of the health topics, they could not be sure if the mobile messages helped. The proof from the studies was often weak.

**For pregnant women and new mothers:**
*   In places where not many women breastfeed, text messages might have helped more women to breastfeed their babies.
*   The messages might have also helped women go to their doctor's appointments before their baby was born.
*   They might have helped more women have a skilled person, like a doctor or nurse, help them give birth.
*   But for all these points, the proof was not strong. When compared to paper flyers, mobile messages may have led to fewer health problems for mothers and babies right after birth.

**For pregnant women and new mothers with HIV:**
*   Mobile phone reminders might have helped women go to more of their doctor's appointments before birth.
*   The messages might have also helped babies take their medicine to prevent getting HIV from their mother.
*   But the messages did not seem to help mothers take their own HIV medicine.

**For parents of children under 5 years old:**
*   Messages might have helped parents make sure their children got their shots to prevent sickness. These shots are also called vaccines.
*   They might have also helped parents get care for their children if they had HIV.

**What the researchers concluded:**
Overall, it is still not certain if mobile phone messages are a good way to improve the health of mothers and children. The messages may help in some small ways, but the proof we have right now is weak.

The researchers believe that we need more and better studies. These new studies would help us know for sure if mobile messages are helpful. Future studies should also check to see if there are any bad side effects from sending these messages.","Communicating to pregnant woman and parents through their mobile devices to improve maternal, neonatal, and child health 
Aim of this review 
We assessed the effect of sending targeted messages by mobile devices to pregnant women and parents of young children about health and healthcare services. 
Key messages 
There are gaps in the evidence regarding the effects of targeted messages by mobile devices to pregnant women and parents of young children about health and healthcare services. Some of these messages may improve some people's health and their use of health services, but others may make little or no difference. The existing evidence is mostly of low or very low certainty. 
What was studied in the review? 
Targeted client communication (TCC) is an intervention in which the health system sends information to particular people, based on their health status or other factors specific to that population group. Common types of TCC are text messages reminding people to attend appointments or that offer healthcare information and support. Our review assessed whether TCC can change pregnant women's and parents' behaviour, health service use, health, and well‐being. 
What happens when pregnant women receive targeted messages by mobile device? 
Compared to women who get no messages 
Women may breastfeed more in settings where exclusive breastfeeding is not common. They may also go to more antenatal care appointments. They may use skilled birth attendants more where this is less common. We do not know if the messages affect women's or babies' health because the certainty of the evidence is very low. 
Compared to women who get messages sent in other ways 
Women and newborns may have fewer health problems during the first 10 days after birth. The messages may make little or no difference to the number of women who breastfeed. We do not know if they make women use more health services. 
Compared to women who get untargeted messages 
The messages may make little or no difference to whether women get influenza vaccines during pregnancy. We do not know if the messages affect women's or babies' health or lead women to use skilled birth attendants more because the evidence is lacking or of very low certainty. 
What happens when pregnant women living with HIV receive targeted messages by mobile device? 
Compared to women who get no messages 
Women may go to slightly more antenatal care appointments. We do not know whether the messages lead more women to give birth in a health facility or improve babies' health because the evidence is of very low certainty. The messages may make little or no difference to whether pregnant women and babies follow antiretroviral (ARV) treatment (used to treat HIV) according to plan. We do not know if the messages affect women's health because the evidence is missing. 
Compared to women who get messages sent in other ways 
We do not know what the effect of these messages is because we lack evidence.
Compared to women who get untargeted messages 
More parents may follow their babies' ARV treatment according to plan. We do not know if the messages improve women's or babies' health or their use of services because the evidence is missing. 
What happens when parents of young children receive targeted messages by mobile device? 
Compared to parents who get no messages 
More parents may take their children to healthcare services such as vaccination appointments. But we do not know if the messages improve children's health or their health behaviour because the evidence is missing. 
Compared to parents who get messages sent in other ways 
Slightly more parents may take their children to vaccination appointments. The messages may make little or no difference to children's toothbrushing habits. We do not know if the messages affect children's health because the evidence is missing. 
Compared to parents who get untargeted messages 
Fewer parents may take their children to vaccination appointments, but this evidence is mixed. We do not know if the messages affect children's health due to lack of evidence. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We searched for studies published up to August 2017. We carried out a search update in July 2019 and relevant studies are reported in the 'Characteristics of studies awaiting classification' section.

10.1002-14651858.CD007263.pub3,"Dilute versus full‐strength formula in exclusively formula‐fed preterm or low birth weight infants 
Review questionIs dilute formula milk (e.g. half the strength at double the volume) better tolerated than full‐strength formula milk in the initial feeding of preterm babies for whom breast milk is not available?  
BackgroundBabies born preterm (at less than 37 weeks' gestation) or with a low birth weight (less than 2500 grams) have special feeding requirements. Expressed breast milk is preferred, but preterm babies are often fed with formula milk because breast milk is not always available. The provision of artificial feeds varies considerably in preterm babies and there is concern that introducing full‐strength formulas too early may lead to the retention of feed in the stomach, which is associated with feeding intolerance and necrotising enterocolitis, a severe bowel disorder. 
Study characteristicsThe evidence for this review is current as of 1 October 2018. We included three trials that compared dilute formula milk (half‐strength, double‐volume) with full‐strength formula milk. The trials involved 102 preterm or low birth weight infants; two were conducted in the USA and one in India. The trials were small (14, 38 and 50 infants, respectively) and conducted between 25 and 30 years ago. The quality of two trials was judged to be poor due to insufficient information being provided in the trial publications, but judged to be moderate in the third trial (of 38 infants). None of the trials assessed necrotising enterocolitis as an outcome. 
Key resultsInfants receiving dilute formula (half‐strength, double‐volume) experienced fewer episodes of feeding intolerance and achieved full energy intake earlier than infants receiving full‐strength formula (20 kcal/oz (~ 68 to 70 kcal/100 mL)). 
Feeding intoleranceTwo measures of feeding intolerance (abdominal distension and episodes of gastric residuals) were reported across the trials. Two trials (88 infants) provided data for abdominal distension and gastric residuals. Infants fed dilute formula experienced 19% (CI 16% to 23%) fewer episodes of abdominal distension (> 2 cm), equivalent to 0.67 episodes per infant in the half‐strength group compared to 0.83 episodes in the full‐strength group. It was not possible to combine data on gastric residuals but both trials reported fewer episodes of gastric residuals in the dilute formula group. The third trial (14 infants) only reported that there was no difference between the groups with respect to these two outcomes. 
Time to establish full enteral feedingIn two trials (88 infants) infants receiving dilute formula experienced a 22% (CI 16% to 28%) reduction in the number of days required to reach an adequate energy intake (420 joules/kilogram), equivalent to 8 days in the half‐strength group compared to 10.3 days in the full‐strength group. 
Certainty of evidenceIn exclusively formula‐fed preterm or low birth weight infants, low‐certainty evidence shows that diluted formula may lead to an important reduction in the time taken to attain adequate enteral fluid and energy requirements, without increasing indicators of feeding intolerance. The clinical importance of the reduction in episodes of feeding intolerance is unclear. These findings are based on three small, old trials that may be of less relevance to current practice. A lack of data on other important outcomes, such as the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis and weight gain, limits the usefulness of the studies.

Is Weaker Baby Formula Better for Babies Born Early or Small?

**Rationale**
Babies who are born too early are called ""preterm."" Some babies are also born at a very small weight. These tiny babies need special care and food to help them grow and be healthy.

The best food for these babies is their mother's breast milk. But sometimes, a mother cannot provide breast milk. In these cases, doctors use a special milk called formula.

Doctors are not sure about the best way to start giving formula to these small babies. Some worry that regular, full-strength formula might be too hard on a tiny baby's tummy. Giving strong formula too soon might cause feeding problems. For example, the baby’s belly might get swollen, or food might stay in the stomach for too long. These are signs that the baby is not handling the food well. It could also lead to a very serious gut sickness that can damage a baby's bowels.

This study looked at past research to answer an important question. Is a weaker, more watery formula safer and better for these small babies when they first start feeding?

**Trial Design**
This report is a review of three older studies. These studies tried to find the best way to feed small babies with formula.

A total of 102 babies were in these three studies. All the babies were either born too early or had a low birth weight. All of them needed to be fed with formula.

In the studies, the babies were split into two groups.
*   One group of babies was given a weaker formula. This was a half-strength formula, which means it had more water.
*   The other group of babies was given the regular, full-strength formula.

Doctors and nurses watched the babies in both groups very closely. They checked for any signs of feeding problems. They also measured how long it took for the babies to be able to drink all the formula they needed to grow each day.

**Results**
The main results from these older studies showed that the babies who got the weaker formula seemed to have fewer problems.

Babies who drank the weaker formula had fewer issues with swollen bellies. They also had less food left in their stomachs before their next feeding. These signs suggest their bodies handled the weaker formula better.

The studies also found that babies on the weaker formula were able to get the full amount of food they needed each day sooner than the other babies. It took them about 8 days to reach this goal. For babies on the full-strength formula, it took about 10 days.

However, the researchers who wrote this report said we should be careful with these results. The proof is not very strong. This is because the three studies were very small. They were also done about 25 to 30 years ago. Medical care for small babies has changed a lot since then.

The studies also did not look at some other important results. They did not check if the weaker formula helped prevent the serious gut sickness. The studies also did not report if one formula was better than the other for helping babies gain weight.

The review suggests that a weaker formula might help small babies start to eat better. But because the studies were old and small, we need new and bigger studies to know for sure if this is the best and safest way to feed them.","Dilute versus full‐strength formula in exclusively formula‐fed preterm or low birth weight infants

Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer‐related death in the world, however lung cancer screening has not been implemented in most countries at a population level. A previous Cochrane Review found limited evidence for the effectiveness of lung cancer screening with chest radiography (CXR) or sputum cytology in reducing lung cancer‐related mortality, however there has been increasing evidence supporting screening with low‐dose computed tomography (LDCT).  
Objectives
To determine whether screening for lung cancer using LDCT of the chest reduces lung cancer‐related mortality and to evaluate the possible harms of LDCT screening. 
Search methods
We performed the search in collaboration with the Information Specialist of the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group and included the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group Trial Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library, current issue), MEDLINE (accessed via PubMed) and Embase in our search. We also searched the clinical trial registries to identify unpublished and ongoing trials. We did not impose any restriction on language of publication. The search was performed up to 31 July 2021.  
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of lung cancer screening using LDCT and reporting mortality or harm outcomes.  
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors were involved in independently assessing trials for eligibility, extraction of trial data and characteristics, and assessing risk of bias of the included trials using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Primary outcomes were lung cancer‐related mortality and harms of screening. We performed a meta‐analysis, where appropriate, for all outcomes using a random‐effects model. We only included trials in the analysis of mortality outcomes if they had at least 5 years of follow‐up. We reported risk ratios (RRs) and hazard ratios (HRs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and used the I2 statistic to investigate heterogeneity.  
Main results
We included 11 trials in this review with a total of 94,445 participants. Trials were conducted in Europe and the USA in people aged 40 years or older, with most trials having an entry requirement of ≥ 20 pack‐year smoking history (e.g. 1 pack of cigarettes/day for 20 years or 2 packs/day for 10 years etc.). One trial included male participants only. Eight trials were phase three RCTs, with two feasibility RCTs and one pilot RCT. Seven of the included trials had no screening as a comparison, and four trials had CXR screening as a comparator. Screening frequency included annual, biennial and incrementing intervals. The duration of screening ranged from 1 year to 10 years. Mortality follow‐up was from 5 years to approximately 12 years.  
None of the included trials were at low risk of bias across all domains. The certainty of evidence was moderate to low across different outcomes, as assessed by GRADE. 
In the meta‐analysis of trials assessing lung cancer‐related mortality, we included eight trials (91,122 participants), and there was a reduction in mortality of 21% with LDCT screening compared to control groups of no screening or CXR screening (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.87; 8 trials, 91,122 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were probably no differences in subgroups for analyses by control type, sex, geographical region, and nodule management algorithm. Females appeared to have a larger lung cancer‐related mortality benefit compared to males with LDCT screening. There was also a reduction in all‐cause mortality (including lung cancer‐related) of 5% (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.99; 8 trials, 91,107 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
Invasive tests occurred more frequently in the LDCT group (RR 2.60, 95% CI 2.41 to 2.80; 3 trials, 60,003 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). However, analysis of 60‐day postoperative mortality was not significant between groups (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.94; 2 trials, 409 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
False‐positive results and recall rates were higher with LDCT screening compared to screening with CXR, however there was low‐certainty evidence in the meta‐analyses due to heterogeneity and risk of bias concerns. Estimated overdiagnosis with LDCT screening was 18%, however the 95% CI was 0 to 36% (risk difference (RD) 0.18, 95% CI ‐0.00 to 0.36; 5 trials, 28,656 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Four trials compared different aspects of health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) using various measures. Anxiety was pooled from three trials, with participants in LDCT screening reporting lower anxiety scores than in the control group (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.43, 95% CI ‐0.59 to ‐0.27; 3 trials, 8153 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
There were insufficient data to comment on the impact of LDCT screening on smoking behaviour.  
Authors' conclusions
The current evidence supports a reduction in lung cancer‐related mortality with the use of LDCT for lung cancer screening in high‐risk populations (those over the age of 40 with a significant smoking exposure). However, there are limited data on harms and further trials are required to determine participant selection and optimal frequency and duration of screening, with potential for significant overdiagnosis of lung cancer. Trials are ongoing for lung cancer screening in non‐smokers.

Can a special lung scan help find lung cancer early and save lives? A review of the research.

**Rationale**

Lung cancer is a very serious disease. It is the top cause of death from cancer in the world. When lung cancer is found early, it is easier to treat. Finding it early can save lives.

Doctors have been looking for the best way to check people for lung cancer. This is called screening. In the past, doctors used regular chest X-rays to screen for lung cancer. But studies showed that these X-rays did not work well to save lives.

A newer type of scan is called a low-dose computed tomography scan. You may hear it called an LDCT scan. This scan uses special X-rays and a computer to create detailed pictures of the lungs. It uses a very low amount of radiation. Some studies have shown that these scans might be better at finding lung cancer early.

The researchers in this study wanted to be sure. They looked at the results of many studies done in the past. They wanted to know if LDCT scans save lives in people at high risk for lung cancer. They also wanted to understand the possible harms of getting these scans.

**Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, the researchers brought together the results from 11 older studies. This is called a review. It helps to get a stronger answer by looking at more people.

The studies included in this review were very well designed. In those studies, people were put into groups by chance. This is the best way to compare different treatments or tests.

In total, the studies had more than 94,000 people. The people in these studies were 40 years of age or older. Most of them had a high risk of getting lung cancer because they smoked for a long time. This was often measured in ""pack-years"". For example, smoking one pack of cigarettes a day for 20 years is 20 pack-years. Most people in the studies had a history of 20 pack-years or more.

In the studies, one group of people had LDCT scans to check for lung cancer. The other group either had regular chest X-rays or no scans at all. The scans were done every one to two years. Doctors then followed all the people in the studies for 5 to 12 years. They watched to see who got lung cancer and who died.

**Results**

The researchers found that LDCT scans helped save lives. People who got LDCT scans were less likely to die from lung cancer. The risk of dying from lung cancer was about one-fifth lower for people who got the scans. This was compared to people who got no scans or just a regular chest X-ray. Women seemed to benefit even more from the scans than men.

The scans also seemed to help people live longer overall. There was a small drop in deaths from any cause in the group that got LDCT scans.

However, the scans also had some harms. Sometimes, a scan can show a spot in the lung that looks like it could be cancer. But often, this spot is not cancer. This is called a false alarm or a false-positive result. People who got LDCT scans had more false alarms than people who got regular chest X-rays.

A false alarm can lead to more tests. For example, a doctor might need to take a small piece of the lung to check for cancer. This is called a biopsy. These extra tests can have risks. People who got LDCT scans were more likely to have these extra tests.

The researchers also looked at another issue called overdiagnosis. This is when a scan finds a very slow-growing cancer that would never have caused a person any harm. The person might get treatments like surgery that they did not need. The study found that some of the cancers found by the scans might have been overdiagnosed.

The researchers also looked at how screening affected people’s feelings. People who got LDCT scans were actually less worried than people in the other groups.

The researchers concluded that LDCT scans can save lives for people who are at high risk for lung cancer. But there are also harms to think about, like false alarms and the risk of overdiagnosis. More research is needed to find the best way to screen people. This includes knowing who to screen and how often to do the scans.","Impact of computed tomography (CT) on lung cancer screening
Background 
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer‐related death worldwide. Lung cancer survival is significantly dependent on when a person is diagnosed with the disease. It is essential to detect the disease as early as possible by radiography (chest x‐ray) or by computed tomography (CT) scan, which is a more detailed type of radiography where multiple images of the lung are taken. The aim of this review was to gather information on the use of CT scan to detect lung cancer earlier and to find out if early detection of lung cancer reduces death from lung cancer. We also evaluated potential harms that can occur from using CT to screen for lung cancer, such as additional investigations and their related complications. 
Description of included trials 
The evidence is current to 31 July 2021. We included 11 trials, with a total of 94,445 participants. The trials came from the USA and Europe. The earliest trial started in 1991, and the most recent started in 2011. The participants were adults over the age of 40. The frequency of screening with CT ranged from yearly to more than 2.5 years. 
Key findings 
Eight of the trials (91,122 participants) were included in the main outcome analysis of lung cancer‐related mortality. In people over 40 years with significant smoking exposure, CT screening reduced deaths from lung cancer by 21%, with 226 people needing to undergo screening to prevent one death from lung cancer. We also found that deaths from any cause (including lung cancer) were less with CT screening. However, the effect was much lower (only 5% reduction in risk). Lung cancer was detected more frequently in the group of people who had CT screening compared with no screening. However, CT scans can induce false‐positive scans (a test that is positive or indeterminate for lung cancer, when the person does not actually have lung cancer). We found that false‐positive results were more common among people who were screened with CT than chest x‐ray. Because of that, those that underwent CT screening had more tests to investigate both cancer and non‐cancer‐related diseases. Screening also implies a risk of detecting lung cancers that may have never progressed to cause harm to the person (this is referred to as overdiagnosis). The risk of lung cancer overdiagnosis with CT screening was estimated to be 18%. 
The trials were too different or did not provide enough information to look at the impact of screening on stopping smoking or quality of life. There was some evidence to suggest there were no long‐term psychological harms from screening, with some people in the CT screening group feeling less anxious compared to the control groups who were not offered screening. 
Certainty of evidence 
The overall certainty of evidence was moderate when it came to outcomes regarding death, with moderate‐ to low‐certainty evidence for other outcomes. The certainty rating for outcomes reflects the authors' confidence and certainty in the outcome being correct.

10.1002-14651858.CD013512.pub2,"Background
Keratoconus is the most common corneal dystrophy. It can cause loss of uncorrected and best‐corrected visual acuity through ectasia (thinning) of the central or paracentral cornea, irregular corneal scarring, or corneal perforation. Disease onset usually occurs in the second to fourth decade of life, periods of peak educational attainment or career development. The condition is lifelong and sight‐threatening. 
Corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) using ultraviolet A (UVA) light applied to the cornea is the only treatment that has been shown to slow progression of disease. The original, more widely known technique involves application of UVA light to de‐epithelialized cornea, to which a photosensitizer (riboflavin) is added topically throughout the irradiation process. 
Transepithelial CXL is a recently advocated alternative to the standard CXL procedure, in that the epithelium is kept intact during CXL. Retention of the epithelium offers the putative advantages of faster healing, less patient discomfort, faster visual rehabilitation, and less risk of corneal haze. 
Objectives
To assess the short‐ and long‐term effectiveness and safety of transepithelial CXL compared with epithelium‐off CXL for progressive keratoconus. 
Search methods
To identify potentially eligible studies, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2020, Issue 1); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov; and World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not impose any date or language restrictions. We last searched the electronic databases on 15 January 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which transepithelial CXL had been compared with epithelium‐off CXL in participants with progressive keratoconus. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodology.
Main results
We included 13 studies with 661 eyes of 567 participants enrolled; 13 to 119 participants were enrolled per study. Seven studies were conducted in Europe, three in the Middle East, and one each in India, Russia, and Turkey. Seven studies were parallel‐group RCTs, one study was an RCT with a paired‐eyes design, and five studies were RCTs in which both eyes of some or all participants were assigned to the same intervention. 
Eleven studies compared transepithelial CXL with epithelium‐off CXL in participants with progressive keratoconus. There was no evidence of an important difference between intervention groups in maximum keratometry (denoted 'maximum K' or 'Kmax'; also known as steepest keratometry measurement) at 12 months or later (mean difference (MD) 0.99 diopters (D), 95% CI −0.11 to 2.09; 5 studies; 177 eyes; I2 = 41%; very low certainty evidence). Few studies described other outcomes of interest. The evidence is very uncertain that epithelium‐off CXL may have a small (data from two studies were not pooled due to considerable heterogeneity (I2 = 92%)) or no effect on stabilization of progressive keratoconus compared with transepithelial CXL; comparison of the estimated proportions of eyes with decreases or increases of 2 or more diopters in maximum K at 12 months from one study with 61 eyes was RR 0.32 (95% CI 0.09 to 1.12) and RR (non‐event) 0.86 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.00), respectively (very low certainty). We did not estimate an overall effect on corrected‐distance visual acuity (CDVA) because substantial heterogeneity was detected (I2 = 70%). No study evaluated CDVA gain or loss of 10 or more letters on a logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) chart. Transepithelial CXL may result in little to no difference in CDVA at 12 months or beyond. Four studies reported that either no adverse events or no serious adverse events had been observed. Another study noted no change in endothelial cell count after either procedure. Moderate certainty evidence from 4 studies (221 eyes) found that epithelium‐off CXL resulted in a slight increase in corneal haze or scarring when compared to transepithelial CXL (RR (non‐event) 1.07, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.14). 
Three studies, one of which had three arms, compared outcomes among participants assigned to transepithelial CXL using iontophoresis versus those assigned to epithelium‐off CXL. No conclusive evidence was found for either keratometry or visual acuity outcomes at 12 months or later after surgery. Low certainty evidence suggests that transepithelial CXL using iontophoresis results in no difference in logMAR CDVA (MD 0.00 letter, 95% CI −0.04 to 0.04; 2 studies; 51 eyes). Only one study examined gain or loss of 10 or more logMAR letters. In terms of adverse events, one case of subepithelial infiltrate was reported after transepithelial CXL with iontophoresis, whereas two cases of faint corneal scars and four cases of permanent haze were observed after epithelium‐off CXL. Vogt's striae were found in one eye after each intervention. The certainty of the evidence was low or very low for the outcomes in this comparison due to imprecision of estimates for all outcomes and risk of bias in the studies from which data have been reported. 
Authors' conclusions
Because of lack of precision, frequent indeterminate risk of bias due to inadequate reporting, and inconsistency in outcomes measured and reported among studies in this systematic review, it remains unknown whether transepithelial CXL, or any other approach, may confer an advantage over epithelium‐off CXL for patients with progressive keratoconus with respect to further progression of keratoconus, visual acuity outcomes, and patient‐reported outcomes (PROs). Arrest of the progression of keratoconus should be the primary outcome of interest in future trials of CXL, particularly when comparing the effectiveness of different approaches to CXL. Furthermore, methods of assessing and defining progressive keratoconus should be standardized. Trials with longer follow‐up are required in order to assure that outcomes are measured after corneal wound‐healing and stabilization of keratoconus. In addition, perioperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care should be standardized to permit meaningful comparisons of CXL methods. Methods to increase penetration of riboflavin through intact epithelium as well as delivery of increased dose of UVA may be needed to improve outcomes. PROs should be measured and reported. The visual significance of adverse outcomes, such as corneal haze, should be assessed and correlated with other outcomes, including PROs.

Comparing Two Treatments to Stop Vision Loss from an Eye Condition Called Keratoconus

### **Rationale**

**What is keratoconus?**

Keratoconus is an eye problem that affects the cornea. The cornea is the clear, dome-shaped window at the front of your eye. In people with keratoconus, the cornea slowly gets thinner. It also starts to bulge out into a cone shape.

This change in shape makes vision blurry. The problem often starts when people are young adults, which can make school and work difficult. If it is not treated, keratoconus can get worse over time and may cause serious vision loss.

**How is keratoconus treated?**

There is a treatment that can stop keratoconus from getting worse. It is called corneal cross-linking, or CXL for short. This treatment uses a special vitamin drop (called riboflavin) and ultraviolet (UV) light. Together, they make the cornea stronger and help stop the bulging.

**Why was this study done?**

There are two main ways to do the CXL treatment.
*   The standard way is called ""epithelium-off"" CXL. In this method, the doctor first gently removes the very thin, top layer of the cornea, called the epithelium. Then, they apply the vitamin drops and the UV light.
*   A newer way is called ""transepithelial"" CXL. In this method, the doctor leaves the top layer of the cornea on.

Doctors hoped that the newer way would be better for patients. They thought it might be less painful and that vision might return to normal faster. They also thought it might have a lower risk of causing cloudy vision, or haze. This study was done to compare the two methods. Researchers wanted to see if the newer way worked as well as the standard way to stop keratoconus. They also wanted to know if it was safer.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with its own patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results from many past studies. This type of research is called a review. It helps to bring all the information on a topic together in one place.

The researchers looked for a specific kind of study called a randomized controlled trial. In these studies, patients are put into groups by chance to receive one treatment or the other. This is the best way to compare treatments fairly.

This review included 13 different studies. In total, the studies looked at 661 eyes from 567 people. All the people in the studies had keratoconus that was getting worse. The studies followed patients for at least one year after their treatment to check on their vision and eye health.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The researchers compared the results of the two CXL treatments. They looked at how well each treatment stopped the cornea’s cone shape from getting worse. They also looked at how the treatments affected vision.

After one year, the researchers did not find a clear winner. There was no proof that one method was better than the other at stopping the cornea from changing shape. The evidence was not strong enough to say for sure.

**How did the treatments affect vision and safety?**

For vision, the results were also unclear. The studies that were reviewed were too different from each other to get a single, clear answer.

When looking at safety, the researchers found one possible difference. The standard ""epithelium-off"" method (where the top layer is removed) may cause a slight increase in corneal haze. Haze is a cloudiness on the cornea that can affect vision. The newer ""transepithelial"" method (where the top layer is left on) seemed to have a lower risk of this problem. However, the evidence for this was not very strong.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

The researchers who did this review concluded that we still do not know which CXL method is better. The studies they looked at were small and were done in different ways, which made them hard to compare.

More research is needed to find the answer. Future studies should be larger and follow patients for a longer time. They also need to measure results in the same way so they can be compared more easily. It is also important for future studies to ask patients how the treatment has affected their daily life and vision.","What surgical procedure works best to slow the progression of keratoconus (an eye disease)? 
Why is this question important?Keratoconus is a disease that affects the thin, clear outer layer of the eye, known as the cornea. Normally, the cornea is dome‐shaped. In people with keratoconus, the cornea slowly thins, and a cone‐shaped bulge develops in the center of the cornea. The disease usually begins between the ages of teens and 40, and persists throughout life. It causes blurry or distorted vision that may not be improved by wearing glasses and may result in perforation of the cornea and other visual problems. 
Treatments such as glasses and contact lenses can be used to improve the vision of people with keratoconus. However, these do not slow the progression of the disease. The only treatment known to slow disease progression is ‘corneal collagen crosslinking’ (CXL). 
CXL is a surgical procedure that aims to strengthen the cornea and prevent further thinning. It involves shining ultraviolet A (invisible) light rays onto eyes that have been treated with eye drops containing riboflavin (a vitamin). When the light rays meet the riboflavin, new links form between the fibers that make up the cornea. 
There are two types of CXL. One type requires the removal of the cells on surface of the cornea, to make it easier for the riboflavin to reach the cornea. This procedure is called ‘epithelium‐off CXL’. The other type does not require the removal of these cells. This procedure is called ‘transepithelial CXL’. Surgeons who carry out this procedure can use chemicals to help riboflavin penetrate the cells on the surface of the cornea. They can also deliver riboflavin to the cornea using a small electrical current (iontophoresis). 
Epithelium‐off CXL is the more commonly used procedure. However, transepithelial CXL could have advantages, such as faster healing and less patient discomfort. We reviewed the evidence to find out which of these two procedures is more beneficial and less risky for people with keratoconus. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?We searched the medical literature for studies that compared epithelium‐off CXL against transepithelial CXL. Then we compared the results and summarized the evidence from all the studies. We rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. 
What did we find?We found 13 studies with a total of 567 people. The studies took place in Europe, the Middle East, India, Russia, and Turkey. The shortest studies lasted six months, and the longest study lasted more than three years. Eleven studies compared transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis against epithelium‐off CXL. Three studies compared transepithelial CXL with iontophoresis against epithelium‐off CXL. 
Transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis compared to epithelium‐off CXL 
We do not know if one procedure is better than the other for preventing progression of keratoconus or visual loss because too few robust studies have compared the effects of these two CXL methods. 
Evidence from four studies suggests that corneal hazing (clouding of the cornea) or scarring are probably more common with epithelium‐off CXL. 
Transepithelial CXL with iontophoresis compared to epithelium‐off CXL 
Evidence from two studies suggests that there may be little to no difference between the two procedures in changes to vision clarity. We do not know if one procedure is better than the other to prevent progression of keratoconus because two few robust studies have compared the two methods. 
The evidence does not suggest that one procedure leads to more unwanted events than the other. However, our confidence in this evidence is low, because it is based on three studies that did not use robust methods. 
What does this mean?Due to a lack of robust evidence, we do not know if epithelium‐off CXL or transepithelial CXL is better for slowing keratoconus progression. 
Adverse events such as corneal hazing or scarring are probably more common with epithelium‐off CXL than with transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis. 
We need more and larger studies to strengthen the evidence. These should compare the benefits and the risks of different CXL procedures. Studies should aim to follow patients for more than 12 months, so that long‐term effects can be compared as it can take at least that much time for corneal tissue to heal from any procedure. 
How‐up‐to date is this review?The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to January 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD013487,"Background
Multiple myeloma is a bone marrow‐based hematological malignancy accounting for approximately two per cent of cancers. First‐line treatment for transplant‐ineligible individuals consists of multiple drug combinations of bortezomib (V), lenalidomide (R), or thalidomide (T). However, access to these medicines is restricted in many countries worldwide. 
Objectives
To assess and compare the effectiveness and safety of multiple drug combinations of V, R, and T for adults with newly diagnosed transplant‐ineligible multiple myeloma and to inform an application for the inclusion of these medicines into the World Health Organization's (WHO) list of essential medicines. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL and MEDLINE, conference proceedings and study registries on 14 February 2019 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing multiple drug combinations of V, R and T for adults with newly diagnosed transplant‐ineligible multiple myeloma. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing combination therapies of V, R, and T, plus melphalan and prednisone (MP) or dexamethasone (D) for first‐line treatment of adults with transplant‐ineligible multiple myeloma. We excluded trials including adults with relapsed or refractory disease, trials comparing drug therapies to other types of therapy and trials including second‐generation novel agents. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included trials. As effect measures we used hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS) and risk ratios (RRs) for adverse events. An HR or RR < 1 indicates an advantage for the intervention compared to the main comparator MP. Where available, we extracted quality of life (QoL) data (scores of standardised questionnaires). Results quoted are from network meta‐analysis (NMA) unless stated. 
Main results
We included 25 studies (148 references) comprising 11,403 participants and 21 treatment regimens. Treatments were differentiated between restricted treatment duration (treatment with a pre‐specified amount of cycles) and continuous therapy (treatment administered until disease progression, the person becomes intolerant to the drug, or treatment given for a prolonged period). Continuous therapies are indicated with a ""c"". Risk of bias was generally high across studies due to the open‐label study design. 
Overall survival (OS) 
Evidence suggests that treatment with RD (HR 0.63 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.99), median OS 55.2 months (35.2 to 87.0)); TMP (HR 0.75 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.97), median OS: 46.4 months (35.9 to 60.0)); and VRDc (HR 0.49 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.92), median OS 71.0 months (37.8 to 133.8)) probably increases survival compared to median reported OS of 34.8 months with MP (moderate certainty). Treatment with VMP may result in a large increase in OS, compared to MP (HR 0.70 (95% CI 0.45 to 1.07), median OS 49.7 months (32.5 to 77.3)), low certainty). 
Progression‐free survival (PFS) 
Treatment withRD (HR 0.65 (95% CI0.44 to 0.96), median PFS: 24.9 months (16.9 to 36.8)); TMP (HR 0.63 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.78), median PFS:25.7 months (20.8 to 32.4)); VMP (HR 0.56 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.90), median PFS: 28.9 months (18.0 to 46.3)); and VRDc (HR 0.34 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.58), median PFS: 47.6 months (27.9 to 81.0)) may result in a large increase in PFS (low certainty) compared to MP (median reported PFS: 16.2 months). 
Adverse events 
The risk of polyneuropathies may be lower with RD compared to treatment with MP (RR 0.57 (95% CI 0.16 to 1.99), risk for RD: 0.5% (0.1 to 1.8), mean reported risk for MP: 0.9% (10 of 1074 patients affected), low certainty). However, the CIs are also compatible with no difference or an increase in neuropathies. Treatment with TMP (RR 4.44 (95% CI1.77 to 11.11), risk: 4.0% (1.6 to 10.0)) and VMP (RR 88.22 (95% CI 5.36 to 1451.11), risk: 79.4% (4.8 to 1306.0)) probably results in a large increase in polyneuropathies compared to MP (moderate certainty). No study reported the amount of participants with grade ≥ 3 polyneuropathies for treatment with VRDc. 
VMP probably increases the proportion of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs) compared to MP (RR 1.28 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.54), risk for VMP: 46.2% (38.3 to 55.6), mean risk for MP: 36.1% (177 of 490 patients affected), moderate certainty). RD, TMP, and VRDc were not connected to MP in the network and the risk of SAEs could not be compared. 
Treatment with RD (RR 4.18 (95% CI 2.13 to 8.20), NMA‐risk: 38.5% (19.6 to 75.4)); and TMP (RR 4.10 (95% CI 2.40 to 7.01), risk: 37.7% (22.1 to 64.5)) results in a large increase of withdrawals from the trial due to adverse events (high certainty) compared to MP (mean reported risk: 9.2% (77 of 837 patients withdrew)). The risk is probably slightly increased with VMP (RR 1.06 (95% CI 0.63 to 1.81), risk: 9.75% (5.8 to 16.7), moderate certainty), while it is much increased with VRDc (RR 8.92 (95% CI 3.82 to 20.84), risk: 82.1% (35.1 to 191.7), high certainty) compared to MP. 
Quality of life 
QoL was reported in four studies for seven different treatment regimens (MP, MPc, RD, RMP, RMPc, TMP, TMPc) and was measured with four different tools. Assessment and reporting differed between studies and could not be meta‐analysed. However, all studies reported an improvement of QoL after initiation of anti‐myeloma treatment for all assessed treatment regimens. 
Authors' conclusions
Based on our four pre‐selected comparisons of interest, continuous treatment with VRD had the largest survival benefit compared with MP, while RD and TMP also probably considerably increase survival. However, treatment combinations of V, R, and T also substantially increase the incidence of AEs, and lead to a higher risk of treatment discontinuation. Their effectiveness and safety profiles may best be analysed in further randomised head‐to‐head trials. Further trials should focus on consistent reporting of safety outcomes and should use a standardised instrument to evaluate QoL to ensure comparability of treatment‐combinations.

Comparing Drug Mixes for a Type of Blood Cancer

### **Rationale**

Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer. It affects the blood cells that are made inside our bones. This can make people feel very sick. It can also cause bone pain and weakness.

The first treatment people get often uses a mix of drugs. Three of these drugs are bortezomib (V), lenalidomide (R), and thalidomide (T). But in many places around the world, these drugs are hard to get.

Researchers wanted to find out which mix of these drugs works best. They looked at how well the drugs helped people live longer. They also looked at the side effects of each drug mix. This study will help decide if these drugs should be on a list of the most needed medicines for all countries.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of 25 past studies. They combined all the information from these studies to compare the treatments.

The studies included more than 11,000 adults. All of them had just found out they had multiple myeloma. They were not able to have a special type of bone marrow transplant.

The studies compared different drug mixes. Most mixes used the drugs V, R, or T. These new drug mixes were compared to an older, standard treatment called MP. Some people in the studies took the drugs for a set amount of time. Other people took the drugs for as long as they worked.

### **Results**

**How long did people live?**

The main question was: did the new drug mixes help people live longer? The researchers compared them to the older treatment, MP.

*   The drug mix called VRD seemed to help people live the longest. People on VRD lived for about 71 months. People on the older MP treatment lived for about 35 months.
*   Other drug mixes also helped people live longer than MP. These included mixes called RD and TMP.

**Did the treatment stop the cancer from growing?**

Researchers also looked at how long people lived before their cancer got worse. For people on the older MP treatment, this was about 16 months.

*   The VRD mix worked best here, too. People on VRD lived for about 48 months before their cancer grew.
*   Other new drug mixes also helped keep the cancer from growing for a longer time than the older MP treatment did.

**What were the side effects?**

The new drug mixes had more side effects than the older MP treatment. A common side effect was nerve damage. This can cause pain, tingling, or numbness.

*   Mixes with the drugs V and T seemed to cause the most nerve damage.
*   The RD mix seemed to cause less nerve damage.
*   Many people on the new drug mixes had to stop treatment. This was because the side effects were too strong. This happened most often with the VRD mix.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

*   The researchers found that the VRD mix helped people live the longest. But this mix also had the most serious side effects.
*   They said that the new drug mixes work well to fight the cancer. But they can also be hard for the body to handle.
*   Doctors and patients need to talk about the good and bad parts of each treatment. More studies are needed to compare these drugs directly. This will help us learn more about their safety.","Multiple drug combinations of bortezomib, lenalidomide and thalidomide for initial treatment of adults with transplant‐ineligible multiple myeloma 
Background 
Multiple myeloma is a type of blood cancer. It accounts for approximately 2% of all cancers and is still considered incurable. For people with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM), who are unsuitable for a procedure where damaged blood cells are replaced with healthy ones (stem‐cell transplant), treatment is usually a multiple drug combination of bortezomib, lenalidomide, or thalidomide, plus melphalan and prednisolone (MP) or dexamethasone (D). Multiple drug combinations are approved for initial anti‐myeloma therapy, however, access to these medicines is restricted in many countries worldwide. 
Aim of the review 
To compare the benefits and harms of selected anti‐myeloma drugs (bortezomib (V), lenalidomide (R), thalidomide (T)) for transplant‐unsuitable NDMM. 
Study characteristics 
We searched selected medical databases and trial registries until 14th February 2019. We included studies comparing multiple drug combinations of V, R, and T for the treatment of people with NDMM who were unsuitable for a stem‐cell transplant. We differentiated between fixed treatment duration and continuous therapy. Fixed therapy is a pre‐specified number of cycles, while a continuous therapy is given until the disease gets worse, the person finds the drug hard to tolerate, or when the treatment is given for a prolonged period. Continuous therapies are indicated with a ""c"". 
Key results 
We identified 25 studies involving 11,403 transplant‐unsuitable adults with NDMM, and comparing 21 different treatment regimens. 
Survival 
People who had the standard treatment, MP, lived for an average of 35 months. People treated with RD, TMP, and VRDc probably live for much longer (moderate certainty). Treatment with VMP may also lead to much longer survival, compared to MP (low certainty). People treated with RD lived for an additional 20.4 months; with TMP an additional 11.6 months; with VRDc an additional 36.2 months, and with VMP an additional 14.9 months. 
Harms 
On average, 0.9% (9 out of 1000) of people treated with MP experienced peripheral nerve damage (polyneuropathies).The evidence was inconclusive whether treatment with RD decreases the risk of developing a polyneuropathy, compared to MP. The estimated risk of polyneuropathies with RD was 0.5%. Treatment with TMP and VMP probably increases the risk of experiencing polyneuropathies compared to MP (moderate certainty). The estimated risk with TMP was 4.0%, and with VMP 79.4%. No VRDc treatment study reported the number of participants with severe polyneuropathies. 
On average, 36.1% (361 out of 1000) of people on MP‐treatment experienced at least one serious adverse event (SAE). VMP probably increases the proportion of participants with SAEs compared to MP to 46.2% (moderate certainty). 
On average, 9.2% (92 out of 1000) of people treated with MP stop the treatment because of adverse events (AEs). Treatment with RD, TMP, and VRDc leads to a much higher proportion of people stopping treatment because of AEs than MP (high certainty). The risk of stopping treatment with RD is 38.5%; with TMP 37.7%, with VRDc 82.1%. Treatment with VMP probably increases the risk of stopping treatment because of AEs compared to MP (9.75%, moderate certainty). 
Quality of life 
Quality of life (QoL) was reported in four studies for seven different treatments and was measured with four different tools. Assessment and reporting differed between studies and could not be meta‐analysed. However, all studies reported an improvement in QoL after anti‐myeloma treatment was started for all assessed treatments. 
Conclusions 
VRDc showed the highest overall survival benefits, compared to MP. RD and TMP also improved OS compared to MP. However, these combinations of drugs also led to more adverse events compared to MP, and led to more people stopping treatment. More trials are needed that look carefully at both harms and QoL.

10.1002-14651858.CD013253.pub2,"Background
Diagnosis of endometrial (womb) cancer is normally made at an early stage, as most women with the disease experience abnormal vaginal bleeding, which prompts them to seek medical advice. However, delays in presentation and referral can result in delay in diagnosis and management, which can lead to unfavourable treatment outcomes. This is particularly a problem for pre‐ and peri‐menopausal women. Providing educational information to women and healthcare providers regarding symptoms relating to endometrial cancer may raise awareness of the disease and reduce delayed treatment. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of health education interventions targeting healthcare providers, or individuals, or both, to promote early presentation and referral for women with endometrial cancer symptoms. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of review articles. 
Selection criteria
We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), both individually randomised and cluster‐RCTs. In the absence of RCTs we planned to include well‐designed non‐randomised studies (NRS) with a parallel comparison assessing the benefits of any type of health education interventions. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently evaluated whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria for the review, but none were found. 
Main results
A comprehensive search of the literature yielded the following results: CENTRAL (1022 references), MEDLINE (2874 references), and Embase (2820 references). After de‐duplication, we screened titles and abstracts of 4880 references and excluded 4864 that did not meet the review inclusion criteria. Of the 16 references that potentially met the review inclusion, we excluded all 16 reports after reviewing the full texts. We did not identify any ongoing trials. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently an absence of evidence to indicate the effectiveness of health education interventions involving healthcare providers or individuals or both to promote early presentation and referral for women with endometrial cancer symptoms. High‐quality RCTs are needed to assess whether health education interventions enhance early presentation and referral. If health education interventions can be shown to reduce treatment delays in endometrial cancer, further studies would be required to determine which interventions are most effective.

Looking for Studies on How Education Can Help Find Cancer of the Womb Lining Early

**Rationale**

**What is cancer of the womb lining?**

The womb is an organ in a woman’s body where a baby grows. Cancer of the womb lining is also called endometrial cancer. It is a common type of cancer. Most women who get this cancer find out early. This is because it often causes a clear sign. The most common sign is unusual bleeding from the vagina. When women see this sign, they often go to a doctor.

**Why is it important to find this cancer early?**

Finding cancer early is very important. When cancer is found early, treatments often work better. This gives women a better chance of getting well. But sometimes, there are delays. A woman might wait to see a doctor after she notices unusual bleeding. Or, a doctor might not send her for tests right away.

These delays can be a problem. They can mean that the cancer is found at a later stage. When cancer is found later, it can be harder to treat. This is a special concern for women who are before or around the time their monthly periods stop for good.

**Why did we do this study?**

We wanted to know if health education could help. Health education means giving people information. This could be information for women about the signs of womb cancer. It could also be information for doctors about when to send women for tests. We thought that if people knew more, there would be fewer delays. This could help women get diagnosed and treated sooner. Our main goal was to find studies that tested if health education works for this purpose.

**Trial Design**

**How did we look for answers?**

This was not a study with new patients. Instead, we did a review. A review means we looked for studies that other researchers had already done. We wanted to find all the studies that looked at using education to help find womb cancer early.

We searched in large online lists of medical studies. Our team looked for specific types of studies. We wanted to find the best kind of studies, called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, people are put into groups by chance. For example, one group of doctors might get new training, while the other group does not. Researchers could then see if the training made a real difference.

If we could not find those types of studies, we planned to look for other well-designed studies. Two people on our team looked at all the search results. They worked separately to decide which studies might be a good fit. This helps make sure we did not miss anything important.

**Who were the studies supposed to be about?**

The studies we looked for would have included women with signs of womb cancer. They also could have included doctors and nurses. The studies would have tested some form of health education. This could have been things like posters, classes, or online training. The goal of the education would be to help women see a doctor sooner or to help doctors find the cancer earlier.

**Results**

**What were the main results of our search?**

Our search for studies was very large. We found thousands of study titles to look at. After reading the titles and short descriptions, we removed most of them. They were not about our question. This left us with 16 studies that seemed promising.

We then read the full text of these 16 studies very carefully. After reading them, we found that none of them were the right type of study to answer our question. They were not designed in a way that could show if health education truly works to reduce delays. We also looked for any new studies that were happening but not finished yet. We did not find any.

**What does this mean?**

Our main finding is that there are no strong studies on this topic. We could not find any good proof to show if health education helps women or doctors act faster on the signs of womb cancer.

This does not mean that education is not helpful. It only means that we could not find any studies that have properly tested it. Because we found no studies, we cannot say what the benefits for patients might be. We simply do not have the information yet.

**What do we conclude?**

The researchers who did this review concluded that we need more research. We need new, high-quality studies to be done. These studies should be designed well so they can give us a clear answer. They should test if teaching women and healthcare workers can help find womb cancer earlier.

If new studies show that education does help, the next step would be to find out the best ways to provide that education. Answering these questions could help more women get the care they need as early as possible.","Do health education interventions lead to early treatment for women with symptoms of endometrial (womb) cancer 
Background Endometrial (womb) cancer arises from the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the lining of the womb. Diagnosis when the disease is still at an early stage (cancer is still within the womb, without spread into nearby tissues) is common, as most women with the disease experience abnormal vaginal bleeding and go to their doctors. However, delayed management of endometrial cancer still occurs. This is particularly a problem for women who are about to go through or are in the menopause. Providing educational information to women and healthcare providers regarding symptoms relating to endometrial cancer may raise awareness of the disease and reduce delayed treatment. We undertook this review to assess whether endometrial cancer education led to women with endometrial cancer symptoms visiting their doctors and being referred for treatment earlier than when there was no education. 
The aim of the review We undertook this review to assess whether endometrial cancer education led to women with endometrial cancer symptoms visiting their doctors and being referred for treatment earlier than when there was no educational information available. 
Main findings We planned to include randomised controlled trials (studies in which people or groups of people are allocated by chance to two or more groups, treating them differently). In the absence of randomised controlled trials, we planned to include studies where participants were not randomised but that included an assessment of the benefits of health education compared to no health education. We searched scientific databases and checked the titles and abstracts of 4880 possibly relevant articles and assessed the full text of 16 of these references. However, we found no studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Conclusions There is currently an absence of evidence to indicate whether providing health education to healthcare providers, or individuals or both, promotes early presentation and referral for women with symptoms of endometrial cancer.

A considerable challenge for maternity care providers is recognising clinical deterioration early in pregnant women. Professional bodies recommend the use of clinical assessment protocols or evaluation tools, commonly referred to as physiological track‐and‐trigger systems (TTS) or early warning systems (EWS), as a means of helping maternity care providers recognise actual or potential clinical deterioration early. TTS/EWS are clinician‐administered (midwife, obstetrician), bedside physiological assessment protocols, charts or tools designed to record routinely assessed clinical parameters; that is, blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, urine output and mental/neurological alertness. In general, these systems involve the application of scores or alert indicators to the observed physiological parameters based on their prespecified limits of normality. The overall system score or alert limit is then used to assist the maternity care provider identify a need to escalate care. This, in turn, may allow for earlier intervention(s) to alter the course of the emerging critical illness and ultimately reduce or avoid mortality and morbidity sequelae. 
Objectives
To evaluate the clinical‐ and cost‐effectiveness of maternal physiological TTS/EWS on pregnancy, labour and birth, postpartum (up to 42 days) and neonatal outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (28 May 2021), ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (7 June 2021), OpenGrey, the ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database (7 June 2021), and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster‐RCTs, comparing physiological TTS/EWS with no system or another system. Participants were women who were pregnant or had given birth within the previous 42 days, at high risk and low risk for pregnancy, labour and birth, and postpartum complications. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (VS and MN) independently assessed all identified papers for inclusion and performed risk of bias assessments. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion and consensus. Data extraction was also conducted independently by two review authors (VS and MN) and checked for accuracy. We used the summary odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to present the results for dichotomous data and the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI to present the results for continuous data. 
Main results
We included two studies, a parallel RCT involving 700 women and a stepped‐wedge cluster trial involving 536,233 women. Both studies were published in 2019, and both were conducted in low‐resource settings. The interventions were the 'Saving Mothers Score' (SMS) and the CRADLE Vital Sign Alert (VSA) device, and both interventions were compared with standard care. Both studies had low or unclear risk of bias on all seven risk of bias criteria. Evidence certainty, assessed using GRADE, ranged from very low to moderate certainty, mainly due to other bias as well as inconsistency and imprecision. 
For women randomised to TTS/EWS compared to standard care there is probably little to no difference in maternal death (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.11; 1 study, 536,233 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Use of TTS/EWS compared to standard care may reduce total haemorrhage (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.69; 1 study, 700 participants; low‐certainty evidence). For women randomised to TTS/EWS compared to standard care there may be little to no difference in sepsis (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.80; 1 study, 700 participants; low‐certainty evidence), eclampsia (OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.74 to 3.03; 2 studies, 536,933 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and HELLP (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.40; 1 study, 700 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), and probably little to no difference in maternal admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) (OR 0.78, 95% CI  0.53 to 1.15; 2 studies, 536,933 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Use of TTS/EWS compared to standard care may reduce a woman's length of hospital stay (MD ‐1.21, 95% CI ‐1.78 to ‐0.64; 1 study, 700 participants; low‐certainty evidence) but may result in little to no difference in neonatal death (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.84; 1 study, 700 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Cost‐effectiveness measures were not measured in either of the two studies.  
Authors' conclusions
Use of TTS/EWS in maternity care may be helpful in reducing some maternal outcomes such as haemorrhage and maternal length of hospital stay, possibly through early identification of clinical deterioration and escalation of care. The evidence suggests that the use of TTS/EWS compared to standard care probably results in little to no difference in maternal death and may result in little to no difference in neonatal death. Both of the included studies were conducted in low‐resource settings where the use of TTS/EWS might potentially confer a different effect to TTS/EWS use in high‐resource settings. Further high‐quality trials in high‐ and middle‐resource settings, as well as in discrete populations of high‐ and low‐risk women, are required.

Can Special Health Check Tools Keep Pregnant Women and New Mothers Safe?

### **Rationale**

It can be hard for doctors and nurses to know when a pregnant woman is starting to get sick. If a health problem is not found early, it can become very serious for the mother.

Doctors and health experts suggest using special tools to watch a mother’s health. These tools are often called “early warning systems.” They help check a person’s health signs. This includes their blood pressure, temperature, and heart rate.

These systems use scores to alert doctors and nurses if a health sign is not normal. The alert tells them that the woman may need extra care right away. This could help doctors treat problems earlier and prevent them from getting worse.

This study looked at past research to see if these early warning systems really help keep mothers and their babies safer.

### **Trial Design**

This paper reviewed two large studies to answer this question. More than 537,000 women took part in these studies.

The women in the studies were either pregnant or had given birth in the last 6 weeks. The studies were done in places with fewer medical resources, like smaller clinics or hospitals.

The women were placed into two groups.
*   One group received the usual care from their doctors and nurses.
*   The other group was watched using one of the special early warning systems.

Researchers then compared the health of the women and their babies in both groups. This helped them see if the early warning systems made a difference.

### **Results**

The study found that the early warning systems may help mothers in some ways. Women who were checked with the tools had less heavy bleeding after birth. They also spent less time in the hospital before going home.

However, the tools did not seem to help with other serious problems.
*   There was probably no difference in the number of mothers who died.
*   There was probably no difference in how many mothers needed to go to the intensive care unit (ICU). This is a special part of the hospital for very sick people.
*   The tools also may not have made a difference for other serious health problems. These include severe infections or a blood pressure problem called eclampsia.
*   For the babies, there was likely no difference in the number of babies who died.

The researchers who did the study believe these tools may be helpful. They might help doctors find problems early. This could be why women had less bleeding and shorter hospital stays.

But they also said more research is needed. The studies were done in places with fewer resources. The tools might work differently in places with more resources, like large city hospitals. Future studies are needed to know for sure if these tools can help all pregnant women.","Physiological track‐and‐trigger/early warning systems for use in maternity care
What is the question? 
The aim of this review is to find out from randomised controlled trials if using simple monitoring tools are helpful in alerting to clinical problems and in reducing serious illness or death in pregnant women and in their first six weeks after birth. Examples of such tools are track and trigger systems or early warning systems kept by the bedside in maternity care. 
Why is this important? 
Many natural functional changes occur in a woman's body during pregnancy. As a result, a pregnant woman, who may appear healthy and well, can become rapidly very sick. This is called clinical deterioration. If not detected sufficiently early and treated successfully, the pregnant woman can become seriously ill or even die. Examples are serious bleeding, development of convulsions when a woman has high blood pressure, blood clots and serious infection. Simple bedside tools or charts can be used by maternity care providers (midwives and doctors) to record information on a woman's health. The recorded health measures include her blood pressure, pulse rate, breathing rate, body temperature, and other health measures such as urine output and mental alertness. The tools have been introduced so that the measures are observed, recorded and interpreted together, rather than as single measures. The intention is to detect when serious illness is, or might be developing. Medical staff can then step in to prevent serious harm.  
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence on 28 May 2021 and identified two studies that compared an early warning system with standard care. One study was a single‐centre study involving 700 women and the second was a stepped‐wedge cluster trial (multiple centres grouped into 'clusters') involving 536,233 women. Different clusters of centres introduced the tool over time until all centres were using the tool. Both studies were carried out in low‐resource healthcare settings. The tools were called the 'Saving Mothers Score' (SMS) and the CRADLE Vital Sign Alert (VSA) device. Risk of bias in the two studies was low or unclear.  
We found that the tools probably do not reduce maternal death. Women may have less serious bleeding (or haemorrhage) when an early warning tool is used. This finding was supported by low‐certainty evidence. We also found that the tools may make little or no difference to a potentially life‐threatening body response to infection (sepsis), to blood pressure with swelling, protein in the urine and convulsions (eclampsia), to a serious illness in pregnancy that affects the blood and the way the liver works (HELLP), or being admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). Use of the tools probably reduces the time a woman stays in hospital (moderate‐certainty evidence). We also found that the tools may make little or no difference to the death of the baby in the first month after birth (neonatal death). This finding was supported by low‐certainty evidence. Neither of the two included studies reported cost outcomes. 
What does this mean? 
Use of early warning tools for women in maternity care in low‐resource settings may reduce serious bleeding and probably reduces the number of days a woman stays in the hospital but may not reduce maternal or infant deaths. More studies are required on the different early warning systems in low‐resource settings. Studies are also needed in middle‐ and high‐resource settings, and in high‐ and low‐risk pregnant women.

Uterine leiomyomas, also referred to as myomas or fibroids, are benign tumours arising from the smooth muscle cells of the myometrium. They are the most common pelvic tumour in women. The estimated rate of leiomyosarcoma, found during surgery for presumed benign leiomyomas, is about 0.51 per 1000 procedures, or approximately 1 in 2000. 
Treatment options for symptomatic uterine leiomyomas include medical, surgical, and radiologically‐guided interventions. Laparoscopic myomectomy is the gold standard surgical approach for women who want offspring, or otherwise wish to retain their uterus. A limitation of laparoscopy is the inability to remove large specimens from the abdominal cavity through the laparoscope. To overcome this challenge, the morcellation approach was developed, during which larger specimens are broken into smaller pieces in order to remove them from the abdominal cavity via the port site. However, intracorporeal power morcellation may lead to scattering of benign tissues, with the risk of spreading leiomyoma or endometriosis. In cases of unsuspected malignancy, power morcellation can cause unintentional dissemination of malignant cells, and lead to a poorer prognosis by upstaging the occult cancer. 
A strategy to optimise women's safety is to morcellate the specimens inside a bag. In‐bag morcellation may avoid the dissemination of tissue fragments. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of protected in‐bag extracorporeal manual morcellation during laparoscopic myomectomy compared to intra‐abdominal uncontained power morcellation. 
Search methods
On 1 July 2019, we searched; the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialized Register of Controlled Trials, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, PubMed, Google Scholar, and two trials registers. 
We reviewed the reference lists of all retrieved full‐text articles, and contacted experts in the field for additional and ongoing trials. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials comparing in‐bag extracorporeal manual morcellation versus intracorporeal uncontained power morcellation during laparoscopic myomectomy in premenopausal women. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methods.
Two review authors independently reviewed the eligibility of trials, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias. Data were checked for accuracy. 
The summary measures were reported as risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). 
The outcomes of interest were a composite of intraoperative and postoperative complications, operative times, ease of morcellation, length of hospital stay, postoperative pain, conversion to laparotomy, and postoperative diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma. Results for the five main outcomes follow. 
Main results
We included two trials, enrolling 176 premenopausal women with fibroids, who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy. 
The experimental group received in‐bag manual morcellation, during which each enucleated myoma was placed into a specimen retrieval bag, and manually morcellated with scalpel or scissors. In the control group, intracorporeal uncontained power morcellation was used to reduce the size of the myomas. 
No intraoperative complications, including accidental morcellation of the liver, conversion to laparotomy, endoscopic bag disruption, bowel injury, bleeding, accidental injury to any viscus or vessel, were reported in either group in either trial. 
We found very low‐quality evidence of inconclusive results for total operative time (MD 9.93 minutes, 95% CI ‐1.35 to 21.20; 2 studies, 176 participants; I² = 35%), and ease of morcellation (MD ‐0.73 points, 95% CI ‐1.64 to 0.18; 1 study, 104 participants). The morcellation operative time was a little longer for the in‐bag manual morcellation group, however the quality of the evidence was very low (MD 2.59 minutes, 95% CI 0.45 to 4.72; 2 studies, 176 participants; I² = 0%). There were no postoperative diagnoses of leiomyosarcoma made in either group in either trial. 
We are very uncertain of any of these results. We downgraded the quality of the evidence due to indirectness and imprecision, because of limited sites in high‐income settings and countries, small sample sizes, wide confidence intervals, and few events. 
Authors' conclusions
There are limited data on the effectiveness and safety of in‐bag morcellation at the time of laparoscopic myomectomy compared to uncontained power morcellation. We were unable to determine the effects of in‐bag morcellation on intraoperative complications as no events were reported in either group. We are uncertain if in‐bag morcellation improves total operative time or ease of morcellation compared to control. Regarding morcellation operative time, the quality of the evidence was also very low and we cannot be certain of the effect of in‐bag morcellation compared to uncontained morcellation. No cases of postoperative diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma occurred in either group. We found only two trials comparing in‐bag extracorporeal manual morcellation to intracorporeal uncontained power morcellation at the time of laparoscopic myomectomy. Both trials had morcellation operative time as primary outcome and were not powered for uncommon outcomes such as intraoperative complications, and postoperative diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma. 
Large, well‐planned and executed trials are needed.

### **Plain Title**

Is it Safer to Remove Uterine Fibroids in a Bag During Surgery?

### **Rationale**

Many women have growths in their womb, also called the uterus. These growths are called fibroids. Fibroids are not cancer. But they can cause problems like heavy bleeding or pain. When this happens, doctors may suggest surgery to remove them.

One type of surgery uses small cuts in the belly. This is often called keyhole surgery. It is hard for doctors to remove large fibroids through these small cuts. So, they often cut the fibroids into smaller pieces to take them out. This process is called morcellation.

Sometimes, a power tool is used to cut up the fibroids. This can cause small bits of tissue to spread inside the body. In very rare cases, about 1 in 2000 times, a growth that looks like a fibroid is actually a type of cancer. If cancer cells spread, it can make the disease worse.

To make the surgery safer, doctors can put the fibroid into a special bag before cutting it up. This may stop tissue from spreading. This study looked at whether cutting up fibroids inside a bag is safer and works as well as the usual method without a bag.

### **Trial Design**

This paper looked at the results from two different studies. These studies compared two ways to remove fibroids during keyhole surgery.

The studies included a total of 176 women who had fibroids. All the women were old enough to still have their periods. The women were split into two groups for their surgery.

In the first group, doctors placed the fibroid in a special bag inside the body. Then, they cut the fibroid into smaller pieces by hand using a small knife.

In the second group, doctors used the common method. They used a power tool to cut the fibroid into smaller pieces inside the body, without using a bag. The researchers looked at what happened during and right after the surgery for both groups.

### **Results**

The researchers who reviewed the two studies found that the proof was not strong enough to make a clear choice. They said the quality of the proof was very low. This means we cannot be sure about the results.

During the surgeries, no serious problems happened in either group. For example, no organs were hurt, and there was no major bleeding. No one in the studies was found to have cancer after their surgery. Because no cancer was found, the studies could not show if the bag helped prevent cancer from spreading.

The researchers were also not sure if one method was faster than the other. The time it took to cut up the fibroid seemed a little longer when using the bag. However, the proof for this was also very weak.

The authors of this review concluded that we do not have enough good information. We cannot say for sure if using a bag to remove fibroids is safer or better. The studies were too small to see rare problems. More and larger studies are needed to give women and their doctors a clear answer.","In‐bag manual versus uncontained power morcellation for laparoscopic myomectomy
Review question 
Cochrane authors reviewed the effectiveness and safety of in‐bag manual morcellation compared to uncontained power morcellation during laparoscopic myomectomy. The primary outcome of the review was a composite of intraoperative (during surgery) complications. 
Background 
Myomectomy is a surgical procedure to remove uterine fibroids — also called leiomyomas. These common, non‐cancerous growths usually develop in the uterus during childbearing years, but they can occur at any age. In laparoscopic myomectomy, which is a minimally invasive procedure, the surgeon accesses and removes the fibroids through several small abdominal incisions. 
Laparoscopic myomectomy is the gold standard for women with uterine leiomyomas, but it is difficult to remove large fibroids through the small incisions and tubes (laparoscopes). To overcome this challenge, surgeons developed a technique to break the large fibroids into smaller pieces (morcellation). 
However, power morcellation (using a drill‐like instrument to cut up the fibroids) inside the abdomen may lead to the scattering of the tissues. These tissues may be benign (such as fibroids or endometriosis), but they may also be tissues from an undiagnosed cancer. A strategy to optimise women's safety is to cut up larger fibroids with a scalpel or scissors, inside a bag. 
Study Characteristics 
We included two randomised controlled trials, which enrolled 176 premenopausal women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy; they were randomised to receive either in‐bag manual morcellation (87 women) or uncontained power morcellation (89 women). The literature was searched to 1 July 2019. 
Key results 
Neither study reported complications during or after surgery, including no diagnoses of leiomyosarcoma, for women in either group. 
We are very uncertain whether in‐bag morcellation reduces the total time of the operation, or improves the ease of morcellation. The evidence suggests that the morcellation operative time was slightly longer when the surgeon used in‐bag morcellation. However, the quality of the evidence is very low and we cannot be certain of any of these results. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of very low quality. The main limitations were indirectness (both trials took place in high‐income settings and countries, therefore, our findings are limited to this type of setting), and imprecision (both trials had small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals).

Medications used to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have significantly improved patient outcomes and delayed time to surgery. However, some of these therapies are recognized to increase the general risk of infection and have an unclear impact on postoperative infection risk. 
Objectives
To assess the impact of IBD medications on postoperative infection risk within 30 days of surgery. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane IBD Groups Specialized Register (29 October 2019), MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2019), EMBASE (January 1985 to October 2019), the Cochrane Library, Clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from inception up to October 2019 and reference lists of articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials, quasi‐randomized controlled trials, non‐randomized controlled trials, prospective cohort studies, retrospective cohort studies, case‐control studies and cross‐sectional studies comparing patients treated with an IBD medication preoperatively or within 30 days postoperatively to patients who were not taking that medication. Manuscripts and abstracts were included. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts and extracted data. The primary outcome was postoperative infection within 30 days of surgery. Secondary outcomes included incisional infections and wound dehiscence, intra‐abdominal infectious complications and extra‐abdominal infections. Three authors assessed risk of bias using the Newcastle‐Ottawa scale. We contacted authors for additional information when data were missing. For the primary and secondary outcomes, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using the generic inverse variance method. When applicable, we analyzed adjusted and unadjusted data separately. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated using GRADE. 
Main results
Sixty‐eight non‐randomized studies were included. Twenty‐four studies had low risk of bias while the remaining had very high risk. Based on pooling of adjusted data, overall infectious complications were increased in patients who received anti‐TNF agents (OR 1.60; 95% CI 1.20 to 2.13; very low certainty evidence) and corticosteroids (OR 1.70; 95% CI 1.38 to 2.09; low certainty evidence). Use of 5‐ASA (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.51 to 1.14; very low certainty evidence), immunomodulators (OR 1.29; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.76; low certainty evidence) and anti‐integrin agents (OR 1.04; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.36; low certainty evidence) had no impact on overall infectious complications. No difference in the odds of wound‐related complications was seen in patients using corticosteroids, 5‐ASA, immunomodulators, anti‐TNF or anti‐integrin agents when compared to controls. Both corticosteroids and anti‐TNF agents increased odds of intra‐abdominal infection (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.28 to 1.84; very low certainty evidence and OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.82; very low certainty evidence, respectively) whereas no impact was observed with 5‐ASA, immunomodulators or anti‐integrin agents. The rate of extra‐abdominal infections was not affected by corticosteroids, immunomodulators, anti‐TNF or anti‐integrin agents. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence regarding corticosteroids, 5ASA, immunomodulators, anti‐TNF mediations and anti‐integrin medications was low or very low in certainty. Thus, the impact of these medications on postoperative infectious complications is uncertain and no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding their safety in the perioperative period. Decisions regarding preoperative IBD medications should be tailored to each patient’s unique circumstances. Future studies should focus on controlling for potential confounding factors to generate higher quality evidence.

### **Plain Title**

Do Medicines for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Raise the Risk of Infection After Surgery?

### **Rationale**

**What is Inflammatory Bowel Disease?**

Inflammatory Bowel Disease, or IBD, is a long-term health problem. It causes parts of the gut, like the bowels, to get swollen, red, and painful. This can cause pain in the belly, diarrhea, and feeling very tired. For some people with IBD, surgery is needed to help treat the problem.

**Why did we do this study?**

There are good medicines that help control IBD. These medicines work by calming the body’s defense system, which is called the immune system. This helps reduce the swelling in the gut.

However, because these medicines affect the immune system, they might also make it harder for the body to fight off germs. This could raise the risk of getting an infection. We wanted to know if taking IBD medicines right before or after an operation increases a person's chance of getting an infection. Knowing this can help doctors and patients make safer choices about their treatment around the time of surgery.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers did a review of past studies. They searched for and collected all the studies they could find that looked at this topic. They gathered the results from 68 different studies to get a bigger, clearer picture.

The studies included people with IBD who were having surgery. The studies compared two groups of people. One group was taking a specific IBD medicine around the time of their operation. The other group was not taking that medicine.

The researchers looked at what happened to people in the first 30 days after their surgery. They checked to see who got an infection and who did not.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The researchers looked at several types of IBD medicines. They found that the quality of the past studies was not very good. This means we have to be careful about the results. The researchers called the information ""low or very low"" in certainty.

Here is what the review found for each type of medicine:

*   **Steroids:** These are strong drugs that reduce swelling. The review found that people taking steroids might have a higher risk of getting an infection after surgery, especially an infection inside the belly.
*   **Anti-TNF drugs:** These medicines block a substance in the body that causes swelling. Like steroids, these drugs also seemed to raise the risk of getting an infection after surgery, especially inside the belly.
*   **Other IBD drugs:** The review also looked at other medicines, called 5-ASA, immunomodulators, and anti-integrins. These medicines did not seem to increase the risk of infection after surgery.

The review also looked at infections in the surgery cut on the skin. None of the IBD medicines seemed to increase the risk of this type of infection.

**What do these results mean?**

Because the studies were not high quality, the researchers cannot be sure about these results. They could not draw any firm conclusions about whether these IBD medicines are safe to take around the time of surgery.

The main message is that there is no ""one size fits all"" answer. The decision to stop or continue taking an IBD medicine before an operation is a choice that each patient must make with their doctor. They will need to think about what is best for that person's own health situation.

The researchers said that we need better studies in the future to get a clear answer to this important question.","Infection risk after surgery in patients using medications for inflammatory bowel disease 
Background  
More than 1.2 million individuals in North America are affected by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is a condition that involves inflammation in the large and/or small intestine(s), resulting in symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain. Many of the medications used to treat IBD suppress the immune system. As a result, use of these medications increases the risk of infection. This increased risk of infection is particularly concerning in patients undergoing surgery. 
Review Question  
This systematic review examined the combined data from 68 previously published studies to determine whether patients using IBD medications around the time of surgery had more infections compared to those not using the same medications. 
Study Characteristics  
This systematic review is current up to 29 October 2019. It included 68 studies in patients with IBD who underwent surgery. Most participants were 18 years or older and both men and women were included. Five IBD medication groups were examined within our study. Infections were tracked up to 30 days after surgery. 
Key Results  
Analyses of this large set of data revealed that infection risk around the time of surgery varied depending on which type of IBD medication the patients were on. Patients being treated with corticosteroids or anti‐TNF agents seemed to have more infections after surgery, while those on 5‐ASA, immunomodulators or anti‐integrin agents did not seem to have more infections after surgery. These findings should be taken with caution as our review included studies which were of limited quality, and therefore we were not able to draw any firm conclusions.These findings could help doctors choose which medications to treat IBD patients with before surgery. Decisions should be tailored to each patient's unique health needs. In addition, this study suggests the need to carefully monitor for infections after surgery in patients who are on certain types of IBD medications.  
Limitations  
One limitation of this systematic review was its dependence on data from a wide range of previously published studies, with various approaches and quality control standards. Most studies examined had very low certainty regarding its conclusions. This review illustrates the need for future high‐quality research examining the impact of medications used to treat IBD on infection risk after surgery.

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of giving omega‐3 supplements to people with cystic fibrosis. 
Background 
In people with cystic fibrosis recurring cycles of infection and inflammation are thought to worsen lung function. Studies suggest that omega‐3 fatty acids, such as those derived from fish oils, may work to counter the inflammation and may be of benefit in chronic inflammatory diseases including cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of the review. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 01 April 2020.
Study characteristics 
This review includes five small studies which compare omega‐3 supplements to a different supplement without omega‐3. In total there were 106 participants, including both children and adults. The studies lasted between six weeks and 12 months. 
Key results

Do Good Fats from Fish Oil Help People with Cystic Fibrosis?

### **Rationale**

Cystic fibrosis is a health problem that mainly affects the lungs. People with cystic fibrosis often get lung infections. These infections cause swelling inside the lungs. This swelling is also called inflammation. Over time, this constant swelling can damage the lungs and make it harder to breathe.

Some studies suggest that certain good fats, called omega-3s, can help reduce swelling in the body. You can find these good fats in fish oil. Because omega-3s may fight swelling, doctors wondered if they could help people with cystic fibrosis.

This research looked at past studies to see if taking omega-3 pills could help with lung problems from cystic fibrosis. The main question was if these pills could reduce swelling and improve health for people with the condition.

### **Trial Design**

To answer this question, researchers did a review. This means they did not do a new study with new people. Instead, they gathered and looked at the results from other studies that were already finished.

The researchers found five small studies to review. In total, 106 people with cystic fibrosis were in these studies. The group included both children and adults.

In each study, about half of the people took omega-3 pills. The other half took a dummy pill that looked the same but had no omega-3s in it. This helps researchers see if the omega-3s were the real reason for any changes. The studies lasted for different amounts of time, from six weeks to one year.

### **Results**

The researchers found that the evidence was not strong enough to be sure if omega-3s help people with cystic fibrosis. The studies they looked at were very small and were not designed well. This makes it hard to trust the results.

Some studies had positive results, while others did not.
*   One study that lasted a year found that people taking omega-3s had fewer lung flare-ups. A lung flare-up is when lung problems get worse. These people also needed to take fewer antibiotic drugs.
*   However, another study found that omega-3s made no difference in how many antibiotic drugs people used.
*   One short study of six weeks found that lung function and overall health got better with omega-3s. This study also found that people had less phlegm, or mucus, in their lungs.
*   But three other studies found no difference in lung function between people who took omega-3s and those who took the dummy pill.

Two longer studies looked at people’s blood. They found that people who took omega-3 pills had more of these good fats in their blood cells. These fats help build strong outer layers that protect the cells. Very few side effects, or bad reactions, were reported in any of the studies.

The researchers concluded that they cannot say for sure if omega-3s help people with cystic fibrosis. Because the results are unclear, they cannot recommend that people with this condition take these pills regularly. More research is needed to know for sure. Future studies should be much larger and last longer to get clear answers.","The use of omega‐3 supplements in people with cystic fibrosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of giving omega‐3 supplements to people with cystic fibrosis. 
Background 
In people with cystic fibrosis recurring cycles of infection and inflammation are thought to worsen lung function. Studies suggest that omega‐3 fatty acids, such as those derived from fish oils, may work to counter the inflammation and may be of benefit in chronic inflammatory diseases including cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of the review. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 01 April 2020.
Study characteristics 
This review includes five small studies which compare omega‐3 supplements to a different supplement without omega‐3. In total there were 106 participants, including both children and adults. The studies lasted between six weeks and 12 months. 
Key results 
Due to the very low‐quality evidence, we are uncertain whether the following effects are due to supplementation or not. One 12‐month study reported a reduction in pulmonary exacerbations and antibiotic use when taking omega‐3 supplementation compared to placebo and one three‐month study reported no change in antibiotic use during the study period.

NB‐UVB delivers almost exclusively 311 nm radiation, whereas BB‐UVB can be divided into two types: selective BB‐UVB (305 to 325 nm radiation) and conventional BB‐UVB (280 to 320 nm radiation). 
This review included 13 small randomised controlled trials (RCT), with a total of 662 participants. Most of these were of poor methodological quality. 
For treating CPP, the clearance rate between the NB‐UVB and oral PUVA groups were inconsistent in three RCTs.

The evidence from the comparison of NB‐UVB with bath PUVA in terms of clearance rate was also inconsistent: Pooled data from two left‐right body comparison RCTs found no significant difference between the two groups, while another RCT favoured bath PUVA. 
Two RCTs found NB‐UVB plus retinoid (re‐NB‐UVB) and PUVA plus retinoid (re‐PUVA) had similar effects for treating people with CPP or guttate psoriasis. One RCT found no significant differences between NB‐UVB and selective BB‐UVB for clearing CPP or in the number of withdrawals due to side‐effects. 
In participants with PPP, one RCT found there were no statistically significant differences between NB‐UVB treated sides and topical PUVA treated sides in terms of clearance rate. 
In summary, NB‐UVB may be preferred to oral or bath PUVA because it is more convenient to use. NB‐UVB seemed to be equal to selective BB‐UVB for clearing CPP.

Comparing Different Light Treatments for Psoriasis

### **Rationale**

Psoriasis is a skin problem that can last a long time. It often causes red, itchy, and scaly patches on the skin. This can be uncomfortable and affect a person’s life.

One common way to treat psoriasis is with light therapy. This treatment uses special lights to help heal the skin. There are several types of light therapy. This study looked at three main types:
*   **NB-UVB:** A special kind of light treatment.
*   **BB-UVB:** Another type of light treatment.
*   **PUVA:** A treatment that uses a special medicine (a pill or cream) plus light therapy.

Doctors wanted to find out which light treatment works best for people with psoriasis. They also wanted to see if one was safer than another. This review looked at past studies to compare these treatments. This information can help doctors and patients choose the best option.

### **Trial Design**

This was a review of past studies. Researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they gathered and studied the results from 13 older studies. In total, these studies included 662 people with psoriasis.

The people in the studies had different types of psoriasis. This included the most common type, called plaque psoriasis. It also included psoriasis on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.

In each of the old studies, people were put into groups by chance. Each group received a different type of light therapy. This is a fair way to compare how well each treatment works. The information did not say how long people were in the studies.

### **Results**

The researchers found that the results from the 13 studies were mixed. Some of the older studies were small and not of the best quality. This made it hard to draw strong conclusions.

Here is what the researchers found:
*   **For common plaque psoriasis:** They compared NB-UVB with the PUVA treatment. In some studies, PUVA cleared skin better. In other studies, both treatments worked about the same.
*   **Comparing two kinds of UVB light:** The NB-UVB treatment worked about as well as the BB-UVB treatment for clearing skin.
*   **For psoriasis on hands and feet:** One study compared NB-UVB with a PUVA cream. It found that both treatments worked about the same.

The researchers concluded that there was no clear winner for which treatment worked best. However, they noted that the NB-UVB light treatment may be a good choice. This is because it is easier to use than PUVA. With NB-UVB, you do not need to take a pill or use a special cream before the light treatment.

More research is needed to know for sure. Future studies should check if NB-UVB is safe to use for a long time. We also need better studies to learn how well it works for psoriasis on the hands and feet.","Narrow‐band ultraviolet B phototherapy versus broad‐band ultraviolet B or psoralen ultraviolet A photochemotherapy for treating psoriasis

Viral load (VL) testing in people living with HIV (PLHIV) helps to monitor antiretroviral therapy (ART). VL is still largely tested using central laboratory‐based platforms, which have long test turnaround times and involve sophisticated equipment. VL tests with point‐of‐care (POC) platforms capable of being used near the patient are potentially easy to use, give quick results, are cost‐effective, and could replace central or reference VL testing platforms. 
Objectives
To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of POC tests to detect high viral load levels in PLHIV attending healthcare facilities. 
Search methods
We searched eight electronic databases using standard, extensive Cochrane search methods, and did not use any language, document type, or publication status limitations. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews, and consulted an expert in the field from the World Health Organization (WHO) HIV Department for potentially relevant studies. The latest search was 23 November 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included any primary study that compared the results of a VL test with a POC platform to that of a central laboratory‐based reference test to detect high viral load in PLHIV on HIV/AIDS care or follow‐up. We included all forms of POC tests for VL as defined by study authors, regardless of the healthcare facility in which the test was conducted. We excluded diagnostic case‐control studies with healthy controls and studies that did not provide sufficient data to create the 2 × 2 tables to calculate sensitivity and specificity. We did not limit our study inclusion to age, gender, or geographical setting. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the titles, abstracts, and full texts of the search results to identify eligible articles. They also independently extracted data using a standardized data extraction form and conducted risk of bias assessment using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS‐2) tool. Using participants as the unit of analysis, we fitted simplified univariable models for sensitivity and specificity separately, employing a random‐effects model to estimate the summary sensitivity and specificity at the current and commonly reported World Health Organization (WHO) threshold (≥ 1000 copies/mL). The bivariate models did not converge to give a model estimate. 
Main results
We identified 18 studies (24 evaluations, 10,034 participants) defining high viral loads at main thresholds ≥ 1000 copies/mL (n = 20), ≥ 5000 copies/mL (n = 1), and ≥ 40 copies/mL (n = 3). All evaluations were done on samples from PLHIV retrieved from routine HIV/AIDS care centres or health facilities. For clinical applicability, we included 14 studies (20 evaluations, 8659 participants) assessing high viral load at the clinical threshold of ≥ 1000 copies/mL in the meta‐analyses. Of these, sub‐Saharan Africa, Europe, and Asia contributed 16, three, and one evaluation respectively. All included participants were on ART in only nine evaluations; in the other 11 evaluations the proportion of participants on ART was either partial or not clearly stated. Thirteen evaluations included adults only (n = 13), five mixed populations of adults and children, whilst in the remaining two the age of included populations was not clearly stated. The majority of evaluations included commercially available tests (n = 18). Ten evaluations were POC VL tests conducted near the patient in a peripheral or onsite laboratory, whilst the other 10 were evaluations of POC VL tests in a central or reference laboratory setting. The test types evaluated as POC VL tests included Xpert HIV‐1 Viral Load test (n = 8), SAMBA HIV‐1 Semi‐Q Test (n = 9), Alere Q NAT prototype assay for HIV‐1 (n = 2) and m‐PIMA HIV‐1/2 Viral Load test (n = 1). The majority of evaluations (n = 17) used plasma samples, whilst the rest (n = 3) utilized whole blood samples. 
Pooled sensitivity (95% confidence interval (CI)) of POC VL at a threshold of ≥ 1000 copies/mL was 96.6% (94.8 to 97.8) (20 evaluations, 2522 participants), and pooled specificity (95% CI) was 95.7% (90.8 to 98.0) (20 evaluations, 6137 participants). Median prevalence for high viral load (≥ 1000 copies/mL) (n = 20) was 33.4% (range 6.9% to 88.5%). 
Limitations 
The risk of bias was mostly assessed as unclear across the four domains due to incomplete reporting. 
Authors' conclusions
We found POC VL to have high sensitivity and high specificity for the diagnosis of high HIV viral load in PLHIV attending healthcare facilities at a clinical threshold of ≥ 1000 copies/mL.

Are Fast HIV Tests as Good as Lab Tests for Checking HIV Levels?

### **Rationale**

**What is an HIV viral load test?**

People with HIV take special medicines to control the virus. These are called antiretroviral therapy, or ART. The medicine works by keeping the amount of HIV in the blood very low. This amount is called the ""viral load.""

Doctors use a viral load test to check if the medicine is working. A low viral load means the medicine is working well. A high viral load may mean the treatment needs to be changed.

**Why did we do this study?**

Right now, most viral load tests are done in big, main labs. A blood sample must be sent away to the lab. Getting the results can take a long time. These labs also use large, costly machines.

There are newer, faster tests that can be used right in a local clinic. These are called “point-of-care” tests. They are often easy to use and give results quickly. This could help people get the care they need sooner.

This study looked at how well these fast tests work. We wanted to see if they are as good as the tests done in big labs at finding a high viral load.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked for all the past studies that had already been done on this topic. They gathered the results from these studies to get a better overall picture.

The researchers looked for studies that compared a fast, point-of-care test to a standard lab test. The studies had to check the viral load in people with HIV.

The researchers found 18 studies to include. These studies had information from over 10,000 people with HIV. The people were from different parts of the world, like Africa, Europe, and Asia. Most were adults who were already taking HIV medicine.

The study looked at a few different types of fast tests. It also looked at tests that used different kinds of blood samples, like whole blood or just the liquid part of blood, called plasma.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The fast tests worked very well. They were very accurate at finding out who had a high viral load.

To see how well the tests worked, we looked at two things:

*   **Finding high viral load:** The fast tests correctly found a high viral load in about 97 out of 100 people who really had one. This means the tests are very good at spotting a problem when it exists.

*   **Finding low viral load:** The fast tests correctly found a low viral load in about 96 out of 100 people who did not have a high level of the virus. This means the tests are also very good at showing when the medicine is working well.

**What does this mean for patients?**

These results are very important. They show that fast, point-of-care tests are a good and reliable choice. People can get accurate results on the same day as their visit. They do not have to wait for a sample to be sent to a big lab.

Faster results help doctors and patients make decisions more quickly. If someone’s viral load is high, they can talk about changing their medicine right away. This can help more people with HIV stay healthy.

The researchers who did this study concluded that fast tests are a great tool. They have high accuracy for checking HIV viral load in people at health clinics.","Point‐of‐care tests for detecting high viral load in people living with HIV attending healthcare facilities 
Why is improving the diagnosis of high HIV viral load infection important? 
It helps to monitor the HIV virus levels in people living with HIV (PLHIV) who are receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). High virus levels indicate that the medications are failing to suppress the virus, a condition known as ART treatment failure, which has a risk of severe illness and death. Rapid diagnostic tests that detect high HIV virus levels quickly near the patient (point‐of‐care) can increase access to early changes in ART. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To determine the accuracy of point‐of‐care (POC) tests for diagnosing high HIV virus levels in PLHIV attending healthcare facilities. 
What was studied in this review? 
Point‐of‐care tests for viral load detection with results measured against central laboratory tests (reference test). We included all forms of tests with POC platforms for VL regardless of the healthcare facility in which the test was conducted. 
What are the main results in this review? 
Fourteen studies that completed 20 evaluations involving 8659 participants compared molecular POC tests for diagnosing high virus levels at the clinically recommended positivity threshold of ≥ 1000 copies/mL. 
What are the strengths and limitations of this review? 
The review included sufficient studies done on samples from PLHIV retrieved from routine HIV/AIDS care centres or health facilities, but it was unclear if all included participants were on ART. Also, none of the included tests was a true POC test conducted at the patient's side: half of the included studies (n = 10) evaluated POC tests in onsite laboratories near the patient, and the other half were tests with POC platforms evaluated in a central or reference laboratory (n = 10). 
To whom do the results of this review apply? 
PLHIV with suspected high viral loads attending healthcare facilities.
What are the implications of this review? 
In theory, for a population of 1000 PLHIV where 100 have high virus levels, 136 people would receive a positive result with the molecular POC test; of these, 39 will not have high viral levels (false‐positive result) and would be incorrectly identified as not responding to ART treatment, possibly leading to unnecessary testing or further treatment; and 864 would receive a negative test result with the molecular POC test; of these, three will actually have high virus levels (false‐negative result) and would be missed whilst failing ART treatment. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence is current to 23 November 2020.

Overall, we analysed a total of 412 adults participants. All the studies had a small number of participants and were conducted over a period of two to four months. Only a few were of high quality. 
Results suggest that SSRIs or SNRIs are no better than placebo (sugar pill) in reducing the number of days with tension‐type headache. There were no differences in minor side effects between participants treated with SSRIs or SNRIs versus those treated with placebo. SSRIs and SNRIs do not seem to offer advantages when compared to other active treatments, specifically the tricyclic antidepressant, amitriptyline. The participants treated with SSRIs or SNRIs suffered fewer minor side effects than those who took amitriptyline, however the number of people who stopped taking one drug or the other due to side effects was approximately equal. These results are based on poor quality, small, short‐term trials (no more than four months). We did not find a study comparing SSRIs or SNRIs with other medications (e.g. botulinum toxin) or non‐drug therapies (e.g. psycho‐behavioural treatments, manual therapy, acupuncture).

Do medicines for depression help stop common tension headaches?

**Rationale**

Tension headaches are a very common type of headache. They can cause a lot of pain. This pain can make it hard to work, sleep, or enjoy daily life. For people who get these headaches often, doctors may suggest taking a medicine every day. This is done to prevent the headaches before they start.

Some medicines used to treat depression may also help with pain. This study looked at two types of these medicines. They are called SSRIs and SNRIs.

Researchers wanted to know if these medicines can help stop tension headaches. They looked at past studies to see if these medicines worked better than a sugar pill. They also wanted to see if they worked better than other treatments for headaches. This work is important to help doctors and patients choose the best treatment.

**Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of studies that were already finished. This is called a review. A review helps bring all the information on one topic together.

The researchers found 8 studies to look at. In total, 412 adults with tension-type headaches were in these 8 studies. Each study was quite short. People in the studies were followed for about 2 to 4 months.

The researchers who did this review noted that the 8 studies they looked at were small. This means they did not include many people. They also noted that most of the studies were not of high quality. This can make the results less certain.

**Results**

The review found that the two types of depression medicine (SSRIs and SNRIs) did not seem to help prevent tension headaches.

People who took these medicines had just as many headache days as people who took a placebo. A placebo is a sugar pill with no medicine in it. It is used in studies to see if a real medicine works. The medicines also did not cause more small side effects than the sugar pill.

The researchers also compared these medicines to an older type of depression medicine called amitriptyline. The newer medicines (SSRIs and SNRIs) were not better at stopping headaches than the older one. People taking the newer medicines had fewer small side effects. But, about the same number of people in both groups stopped taking their medicine because of side effects.

The main conclusion is that SSRIs and SNRIs do not seem to be a good choice for preventing tension headaches. These results come from small, short, and low-quality studies. This means we need more and better research to be sure. The researchers also did not find any studies that compared these medicines to non-drug treatments. These could include therapy, special exercises, or acupuncture.","Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for preventing tension‐type headache

Decision coaching is non‐directive support delivered by a healthcare provider to help patients prepare to actively participate in making a health decision. ‘Healthcare providers’ are considered to be all people who are engaged in actions whose primary intent is to protect and improve health (e.g. nurses, doctors, pharmacists, social workers, health support workers such as peer health workers). 
Little is known about the effectiveness of decision coaching.
Objectives
To determine the effects of decision coaching (I) for people facing healthcare decisions for themselves or a family member (P) compared to (C) usual care or evidence‐based intervention only, on outcomes (O) related to preparation for decision making, decisional needs and potential adverse effects. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library (Wiley), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), CINAHL (Ebsco), Nursing and Allied Health Source (ProQuest), and Web of Science from database inception to June 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where the intervention was provided to adults or children preparing to make a treatment or screening healthcare decision for themselves or a family member. Decision coaching was defined as: a) delivered individually by a healthcare provider who is trained or using a protocol; and b) providing non‐directive support and preparing an adult or child to participate in a healthcare decision. Comparisons included usual care or an alternate intervention. There were no language restrictions. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened citations, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data on characteristics of the intervention(s) and outcomes. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion to reach consensus. We used the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as the measures of treatment effect and, where possible, synthesised results using a random‐effects model. If more than one study measured the same outcome using different tools, we used a random‐effects model to calculate the standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI. We presented outcomes in summary of findings tables and applied GRADE methods to rate the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
Out of 12,984 citations screened, we included 28 studies of decision coaching interventions alone or in combination with evidence‐based information, involving 5509 adult participants (aged 18 to 85 years; 64% female, 52% white, 33% African‐American/Black; 68% post‐secondary education). The studies evaluated decision coaching used for a range of healthcare decisions (e.g. treatment decisions for cancer, menopause, mental illness, advancing kidney disease; screening decisions for cancer, genetic testing). Four of the 28 studies included three comparator arms.  
For decision coaching compared with usual care (n = 4 studies), we are uncertain if decision coaching compared with usual care improves any outcomes (i.e. preparation for decision making, decision self‐confidence, knowledge, decision regret, anxiety) as the certainty of the evidence was very low.  
For decision coaching compared with evidence‐based information only (n = 4 studies), there is low certainty‐evidence that participants exposed to decision coaching may have little or no change in knowledge (SMD ‐0.23, 95% CI: ‐0.50 to 0.04; 3 studies, 406 participants). There is low certainty‐evidence that participants exposed to decision coaching may have little or no change in anxiety, compared with evidence‐based information. We are uncertain if decision coaching compared with evidence‐based information improves other outcomes (i.e. decision self‐confidence, feeling uninformed) as the certainty of the evidence was very low. 
For decision coaching plus evidence‐based information compared with usual care (n = 17 studies), there is low certainty‐evidence that participants may have improved knowledge (SMD 9.3, 95% CI: 6.6 to 12.1; 5 studies, 1073 participants). We are uncertain if decision coaching plus evidence‐based information compared with usual care improves other outcomes (i.e. preparation for decision making, decision self‐confidence, feeling uninformed, unclear values, feeling unsupported, decision regret, anxiety) as the certainty of the evidence was very low. 
For decision coaching plus evidence‐based information compared with evidence‐based information only (n = 7 studies), we are uncertain if decision coaching plus evidence‐based information compared with evidence‐based information only improves any outcomes (i.e. feeling uninformed, unclear values, feeling unsupported, knowledge, anxiety) as the certainty of the evidence was very low. 
Authors' conclusions
Decision coaching may improve participants’ knowledge when used with evidence‐based information. Our findings do not indicate any significant adverse effects (e.g. decision regret, anxiety) with the use of decision coaching. It is not possible to establish strong conclusions for other outcomes. It is unclear if decision coaching always needs to be paired with evidence‐informed information. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of decision coaching for a broader range of outcomes.

Does Health Coaching Help People Make Medical Choices?

**Rationale**

Making a choice about your health can be hard. You may have to decide about a treatment, a test, or a surgery. It can feel stressful to make the right choice for you or a loved one.

Sometimes, a health worker can act as a coach to help you. This is called decision coaching. A health coach does not tell you what to do. Instead, they help you think about your choices. They can help you get ready to talk to your doctor and make a decision you feel good about.

We do not know for sure if this kind of coaching really helps people. Researchers wanted to find out. This study looked at past research to see if decision coaching helps people feel more prepared and confident when making health choices. The study also looked to see if coaching could help people understand their health options better.

**Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of 28 past studies on this topic. By combining the results, they hoped to get a clearer answer.

The 28 studies included more than 5,500 adults. The people in the studies were between 18 and 85 years old. About 6 out of every 10 people were women. The people in these studies were making many different kinds of health decisions. Some were deciding about treatment for cancer or kidney disease. Others were deciding about health tests.

The researchers compared groups of people to see what worked best. They looked at four different comparisons:
*   Some studies compared people who got coaching to people who got their normal care.
*   Some studies compared people who got coaching to people who only got facts about their health choice.
*   Some studies compared people who got coaching and health facts to people who got normal care.
*   Some studies compared people who got coaching and health facts to people who only got health facts.

Because this was a review of many different studies, the amount of time each person spent in a study was different.

**Results**

The researchers found that the results from the 28 studies were not very clear. It is hard to say for sure if decision coaching is helpful.

When coaching was compared with the normal care people get, the researchers were not sure if it helped people. The evidence was not strong enough to make a conclusion.

When coaching was given with facts about a health choice, it seemed to help a little. People who got both coaching and health facts may have known more about their choices than people who got only their normal care.

However, for most other things, the results were uncertain. It was not clear if coaching helped people feel more confident. It was also not clear if it helped them feel less worried or better supported.

One important finding was that decision coaching did not cause any harm. People who got coaching did not feel more worried. They also did not regret their decisions more than other people.

The study leaders concluded that decision coaching might help people learn more when it is given along with good health information. But more research is needed to know for sure how well it works and who it helps the most.","Decision coaching for people making healthcare decisions
Background 
There is a need to better involve people who are making healthcare decisions about treatments (e.g. surgery) or screening (e.g. tests to tell if there is a health problem). Quality decisions are made when people know the best available evidence on options and can share what matters with their healthcare provider(s). 
Decision coaching supports people to prepare for making a health decision. It is provided by healthcare providers who are trained or use a protocol for decision coaching (e.g. nurses, doctors, pharmacists, social workers, health support workers such as peer health workers).  
We wanted to find out if decision coaching helps people to prepare for making healthcare decisions. 
 
What did we do? 
We are a team of patient partners, healthcare providers, teachers and researchers from seven countries. 
We looked for studies that tested decision coaching with people (adults and children) to prepare them for making a healthcare decision about treatment or screening for themselves or a family member. 
We included studies if people who received decision coaching were randomly put into study groups (e.g. using a computer to decide who goes in which group). Studies where people are randomly put into groups are the best way to compare findings between groups and give results we can rely on when we look at the effects of an intervention like decision coaching.  
 
Search strategy  
To find studies, we searched eight online data banks. We asked experts and authors of studies about decision coaching. We included studies published up to June 2021.  
 
What we found  
We found 28 studies about decision coaching used alone or with high‐quality patient information based on research (called ‘evidence‐based information’). There was a total of 5509 adults in the 28 studies. None of the studies included children, and only one study included people (parents) making decisions for someone else. The studies tested decision coaching with a range of healthcare decisions such as treatment decisions related to cancer, menopause, or mental illness; cancer screening decisions, and genetic testing.  
Some of the studies looked at decision coaching with, or compared to, disease‐specific information or evidence‐based information such as patient decision aids (booklets, videos, online tools that: make the decision clear, provide options and the pros and cons, and help people be clear on what matters to them). 
 
What does the evidence show? 
People who received decision coaching compared with evidence‐based information only: 
‐ may have little or no change in knowledge (406 patients, 3 studies);
‐ may have little of no change in anxiety (242 patients, 1 study).
 
People who received decision coaching plus evidence‐based information compared with usual care:  
‐may have improved knowledge (1073 patients, 5 studies)
 
Our confidence in the results 
We have low confidence that decision coaching plus evidence‐based information improves people’s knowledge compared to usual care. We have low confidence that decision coaching may have little or no effect on knowledge and anxiety compared to evidence‐based information. We are less confident about our other findings, as the certainty of the evidence is very low and there were important outcomes that were not reported by the included studies. Many studies had a small number of people taking part and this means that the results of this review might change with more studies.   
 
What this means 
Decision coaching may improve peoples’ knowledge to help them prepare to make healthcare decisions when used with evidence‐based information. The review did not detect any adverse effects with the use of decision coaching.

10.1002-14651858.CD012948,"Planned birth at or near term for improving health outcomes for pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes and their infants 
What is the issue? 
The aim of this Cochrane review was to find out if planning an elective birth at or near the term of pregnancy, compared to waiting for labour to start spontaneously, has an impact on the health of women with diabetes and the health of their babies. This review focuses on women who have diabetes before becoming pregnant (pre‐existing diabetes). Elective birth is carried out either by induction of labour or caesarean section, and 'at or near term' means 37 to 40 weeks' gestation. 
To answer this question, we searched for all relevant studies (date of search: 15 August 2017), with the aim of collecting and analysing them together. 
Why is this important? 
When women with diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2) become pregnant they are at higher risk of complications than women who do not have diabetes. For example, their babies may be larger and have a higher risk of death in the later weeks of pregnancy. Because of these risks, many clinicians have recommended that women with diabetes have an elective birth (usually by induction) at or near term (37 to 40 weeks' gestation), rather than waiting for labour to start spontaneously or until 41 weeks' gestation if all is well. Induction has the disadvantage of increasing the incidence of forceps or ventouse births, and women often find it difficult to cope with an induced labour. Caesarean section is a major operation which can lead to blood loss, infections and increased chance of problems with subsequence births. Early birth can increase the chance of breathing problems for babies. It is important to know which approach to birth has a better impact on the health outcomes of women with pre‐existing diabetes and their babies. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found no studies that addressed our specific question.
What does this mean? 
In the absence of randomised studies, we are unable to say if women with pre‐existing diabetes and their babies experience better health outcomes if they have a planned birth (by induction of labour or caesarean section at 37 to 40 weeks' gestation) compared to waiting for labour to begin spontaneously or until 41 weeks' gestation if all is well. More research is needed to answer this question. 
","**Plain Title**
Is it safer to plan a birth for pregnant women who have diabetes?

**Rationale**
Some women have diabetes before they get pregnant. This is called pre-existing diabetes. It can be Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. When these women are pregnant, there can be a higher chance of problems for them and their babies.

These problems can be serious. For example, the baby might grow much larger than normal. There is also a higher risk that the baby could die late in the pregnancy. Because of these risks, many doctors suggest that the birth should be planned. This means not waiting for labor to start on its own.

A planned birth is often done between 37 and 40 weeks of pregnancy. A doctor can use medicine to start labor. This is called an induction. Or, a doctor can deliver the baby through an operation called a C-section. But planning a birth has its own risks too. An induction can make labor long and hard. A C-section is a major surgery that can lead to infections or blood loss. Also, babies born a little early can sometimes have breathing problems.

Researchers wanted to know which way is safer. Is it better to plan the birth? Or is it better to wait for labor to start by itself? This study looked for answers to this important question.

**Trial Design**
This was not a study with new patients. Instead, researchers did a review. They looked for all past studies that had already been done on this topic. They wanted to find studies that were designed in a specific way. These studies needed to compare two groups of pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes.

One group would have had a planned birth. This means their labor was started with medicine or they had a C-section. The other group would have waited for labor to begin on its own. By comparing the two groups, we could learn which way led to healthier moms and babies.

The researchers searched for studies up to August 2017. Their goal was to collect all the information from these past studies. Then, they planned to put all the results together to find a clear answer.

**Results**
The researchers looked very carefully for studies to include in their review. But they did not find any studies that answered their question. There were no studies that compared planned birth with waiting for labor in women with pre-existing diabetes.

Because no studies were found, we still do not know which choice is better. We cannot say if planning a birth is safer for women with diabetes and their babies. We also cannot say if it is safer to wait for labor to start naturally.

This review shows that there is a big gap in our medical knowledge. Doctors and pregnant women have to make this choice without clear facts to help them. The main conclusion from this review is that we need new studies. These new studies are very important to help us find the safest way for women with diabetes to give birth.","Planned birth at or near term for improving health outcomes for pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes and their infants

10.1002-14651858.CD013498.pub2,"Background
People with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) need treatment with insulin for survival. Whether any particular type of (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin provides benefit especially regarding risk of diabetes complications and hypoglycaemia is unknown. 
Objectives
To compare the effects of long‐term treatment with (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin analogues to NPH insulin (neutral protamine Hagedorn) or another (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin analogue in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the reference lists of systematic reviews, articles and health technology assessment reports. We explored the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medical Agency (EMA) web pages. We asked pharmaceutical companies, EMA and investigators for additional data and clinical study reports (CSRs). The date of the last search of all databases was 24 August 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of 24 weeks or more comparing one (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin to NPH insulin or another (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin in people with T1DM. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors assessed risk of bias using the new Cochrane 'Risk of bias' 2 (RoB 2) tool and extracted data. Our main outcomes were all‐cause mortality, health‐related quality of life (QoL), severe hypoglycaemia, non‐fatal myocardial infarction/stroke (NFMI/NFS), severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia, serious adverse events (SAEs) and glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). We used a random‐effects model to perform meta‐analyses and calculated risk ratios (RRs) and odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and 95% prediction intervals for effect estimates. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence applying the GRADE instrument. 
Main results
We included 26 RCTs. Two studies were unpublished. We obtained CSRs, clinical study synopses or both as well as medical reviews from regulatory agencies on 23 studies which contributed to better analysis of risk of bias and improved data extraction. A total of 8784 participants were randomised: 2428 participants were allocated to NPH insulin, 2889 participants to insulin detemir, 2095 participants to insulin glargine and 1372 participants to insulin degludec. Eight studies contributing 21% of all participants comprised children. The duration of the intervention varied from 24 weeks to 104 weeks. 
Insulin degludec versus NPH insulin: we identified no studies comparing insulin degludec with NPH insulin. 
Insulin detemir versus NPH insulin (9 RCTs): five deaths reported in two studies including adults occurred in the insulin detemir group (Peto OR 4.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 31.38; 9 studies, 3334 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Three studies with 870 participants reported QoL showing no true beneficial or harmful effect for either intervention (low‐certainty evidence). There was a reduction in severe hypoglycaemia in favour of insulin detemir: 171/2019 participants (8.5%) in the insulin detemir group compared with 138/1200 participants (11.5%) in the NPH insulin group experienced severe hypoglycaemia (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.92; 8 studies, 3219 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The 95% prediction interval ranged between 0.34 and 1.39. Only 1/331 participants in the insulin detemir group compared with 0/164 participants in the NPH insulin group experienced a NFMI (1 study, 495 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No study reported NFS. A total of 165/2094 participants (7.9%) in the insulin detemir group compared with 102/1238 participants (8.2%) in the NPH insulin group experienced SAEs (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.21; 9 studies, 3332 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia was observed in 70/1823 participants (3.8%) in the insulin detemir group compared with 60/1102 participants (5.4%) in the NPH insulin group (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.17; 7 studies, 2925 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The MD in HbA1c comparing insulin detemir with NPH insulin was 0.01%, 95% CI ‐0.1 to 0.1; 8 studies, 3122 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence. 
Insulin glargine versus NPH insulin (9 RCTs): one adult died in the NPH insulin group (Peto OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.00 to 6.98; 8 studies, 2175 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Four studies with 1013 participants reported QoL showing no true beneficial effect or harmful effect for either intervention (low‐certainty evidence). Severe hypoglycaemia was observed in 122/1191 participants (10.2%) in the insulin glargine group compared with 145/1159 participants (12.5%) in the NPH insulin group (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.04; 9 studies, 2350 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). No participant experienced a NFMI and one participant in the NPH insulin group experienced a NFS in the single study reporting this outcome (585 participants; low‐certainty evidence). A total of 109/1131 participants (9.6%) in the insulin glargine group compared with 110/1098 participants (10.0%) in the NPH insulin group experienced SAEs (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.84; 8 studies, 2229 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia was observed in 69/938 participants (7.4%) in the insulin glargine group compared with 83/955 participants (8.7%) in the NPH insulin group (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.12; 6 studies, 1893 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The MD in HbA1c comparing insulin glargine with NPH insulin was 0.02%, 95% CI ‐0.1 to 0.1; 9 studies, 2285 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence. 
Insulin detemir versus insulin glargine (2 RCTs),insulin degludec versus insulin detemir (2 RCTs), insulin degludec versus insulin glargine (4 RCTs): there was no evidence of a clinically relevant difference for all main outcomes comparing (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin analogues with each other. 
For all outcomes none of the comparisons indicated differences in tests of interaction for children versus adults. 
Authors' conclusions
Comparing insulin detemir with NPH insulin for T1DM showed lower risk of severe hypoglycaemia in favour of insulin detemir (moderate‐certainty evidence). However, the 95% prediction interval indicated inconsistency in this finding. Both insulin detemir and insulin glargine compared with NPH insulin did not show benefits or harms for severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia. For all other main outcomes with overall low risk of bias and comparing insulin analogues with each other, there was no true beneficial or harmful effect for any intervention. Data on patient‐important outcomes such as QoL, macrovascular and microvascular diabetic complications were sparse or missing. No clinically relevant differences were found between children and adults.

### **Plain Title**

Comparing Long-Acting Insulins for People with Type 1 Diabetes

### **Rationale**

People with type 1 diabetes need to take a medicine called insulin every day to live. Their bodies cannot make their own insulin. Without insulin, their blood sugar can get too high. This can cause serious health problems over time.

Most people with type 1 diabetes use a long-acting insulin. This insulin works slowly through the day to keep blood sugar levels steady. There are several types of long-acting insulin. An older type is called NPH insulin. Newer types include detemir, glargine, and degludec.

Doctors wanted to know if the newer types of insulin were better or safer than the older NPH insulin. They also wanted to see if any of the newer insulins were better than the others. This study was done to compare them. The researchers looked to see if one type was better at controlling blood sugar or preventing problems like very low blood sugar.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers gathered the results from 26 previous studies. This kind of research helps to get a stronger answer by combining a lot of information.

The studies they looked at were fair tests. In those studies, people were put into groups by chance to get one type of insulin or another.

A total of 8,784 people with type 1 diabetes were in these studies. The studies included both children and adults. People in the studies used their assigned insulin for about 6 months to 2 years.

### **Results**

Here is what the researchers found when they compared the different insulins.

**Newer Insulin (Detemir) vs. Older Insulin (NPH)**

*   People who took the newer insulin, detemir, had a lower risk of very low blood sugar. Very low blood sugar is a serious problem where a person may need help from others.
*   There was no real difference in blood sugar control over time. A blood test called HbA1c showed this. This test measures average blood sugar over 2 to 3 months.
*   There was no clear difference in the risk of serious health problems or very low blood sugar that happens at night.

**Newer Insulin (Glargine) vs. Older Insulin (NPH)**

*   When researchers compared another new insulin, glargine, to the older NPH insulin, they found no clear differences.
*   The risk of very low blood sugar was about the same for both groups.
*   Blood sugar control over time was also the same for both insulins.

**Newer Insulins Compared to Each Other**

*   The researchers also compared the different newer insulins to one another.
*   They did not find any real proof that one of the newer insulins was better or safer than another.

**Main Conclusions**

The main benefit found in this review was for the newer insulin called detemir. It may cause fewer episodes of very low blood sugar compared to the older NPH insulin. For most other things that matter to patients, there was no clear winner. The different insulins had a similar effect on long-term blood sugar control.

The researchers also noted that there was not much information on how these insulins affect quality of life or long-term health problems like heart attacks. They said more studies are needed to look at these important topics. The results were the same for both children and adults.","Do people with type 1 diabetes mellitus benefit from using a different type of insulin as their basal insulin? 
Background 
Diabetes is a condition that causes a person's blood sugar (glucose) level to become too high. Insulin is a hormone that is released by the pancreas (a small organ behind the stomach) which controls the blood levels of glucose. In people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) the pancreas does not produce any insulin, so the person has to inject insulin to control the glucose levels and keep well. The goal of insulin therapy is to provide insulin that mimics physiologic insulin secretion. Insulin is given by an injection under the skin (subcutaneous) by means of insulin syringes, insulin pens or insulin pumps. In order to control blood glucose levels in periods of fasting, basal or background insulin is needed. Basal insulin can be given by means of daily or twice‐daily injections of an intermediate‐acting or (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin. Basal insulin can be given as intermediate‐acting human neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin or as (ultra‐)long‐acting analogue insulin (synthetic insulin). Bolus insulin is taken at mealtime (prandial insulin) to control blood glucose levels following a meal and is given by means of short‐acting or rapid‐acting insulin. The aim for most people with T1DM is to achieve near‐normal blood glucose levels to avoid long‐term complications such as kidney and eye disease and to allow flexibility regarding time, type and amount of food intake. The major unwanted effect of insulin therapy is hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) which can be severe. 
We wanted to find out whether one type of (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin compared with NPH insulin or another type of (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin is better for people with T1DM. The outcomes we were specifically interested in were death, health‐related quality of life, severe (night‐time) hypoglycaemia, serious unwanted events, non‐fatal complications of diabetes (heart attacks, strokes) and levels of glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) which is an indicator of long‐term glucose control. 
What did we look for? 
We searched medical databases and contacted pharmaceutical manufacturers and drug regulatory agencies for studies that:— were randomised controlled trials (medical studies where participants are put randomly into one of the treatment groups);— included people with T1DM;— compared one (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin with another (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin or NPH insulin;— lasted at least 24 weeks. 
What did we find?We found 26 studies including a total of 8780 participants (21% were children). The studies lasted between 24 weeks and two years. They compared:— NPH insulin with insulin detemir (nine studies);— NPH insulin with insulin glargine (nine studies);— Insulin detemir with insulin glargine (two studies);— Insulin degludec with insulin detemir (two studies);— Insulin degludec with insulin glargine (four studies). 
No study compared NPH insulin with insulin degludec.
Key results 
There were no clear differences for all main outcomes comparing (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin analogues with each other. 
Severe hypoglycaemic episodes were reduced with insulin detemir: among 1000 participants using NPH insulin, 115 would experience severe hypoglycaemia; using insulin detemir there would be 36 participants fewer (9 to 55 participants fewer) experiencing severe hypoglycaemia. However, the results were inconsistent, meaning if another study was performed there may not be a clear difference between insulin detemir and NPH insulin. There was no clear difference regarding the risk of severe night‐time hypoglycaemia. There were no clear differences for health‐related quality of life, serious unwanted effects or HbA1c levels. Very few people experienced a heart attack or died, and stroke was not reported. 
There were no clear differences comparing insulin glargine with NPH insulin for all main outcomes. Very few people experienced a heart attack, stroke or died. 
There were also no clear differences for all comparisons between children and adults.
Certainty of the evidence In the comparison of the insulin analogues detemir and glargine with NPH insulin, we are moderately confident about the results for death, severe (night‐time) hypoglycaemia, serious unwanted effects and HbA1c levels. We are uncertain about the effects on heart attacks, stroke and health‐related quality of life, mainly because there were only a few studies which did not last long enough to reliably investigate these outcomes.

10.1002-14651858.CD012080.pub2,"Accuracy of different non‐invasive methods for identifying Helicobacter pylori 
Why is it important to know whether someone has Helicobacter pylori? 
Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) is a type of bacteria which may be present in the stomach of some people. H pylori is believed to cause a number of cancers, including stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, and throat cancer. H pylori is also linked with other diseases including stomach ulcers, heart burn, and a bloated feeling. If H pylori is found in an individual, appropriate treatment can be started. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To compare the accuracy of three different types of test for H pylori. These are: urea breath tests, blood tests (the specific blood test is called serology), and stool tests (in faeces). 
What was studied in this review? 
There are two types of urea breath test which use two different forms of carbon known as 13C and 14C, as well as multiple versions of serology and stool tests. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found 101 studies which included 11,003 people who were tested for H pylori. Of these 11,003 participants, 5839 (53.1%) had H pylori infection. All the studies used one of the three tests listed above and compared these test results with the diagnosis given by endoscopic biopsy. Endoscopic biopsy involves obtaining tissue from the stomach using a thin flexible tube introduced through the mouth and testing for the presence of H pylori under the microscope. It is currently the most accurate available test, however it causes physical discomfort to the patient, with associated risks for harm. This is in contrast to the alternative non‐invasive tests in this review which are significantly less uncomfortable and have minimal or no risk of harm, making them desirable alternatives if they can be shown to be as accurate at diagnosing H pylori as endoscopic biopsy. Most of the studies included participants with heart burn or similar problems in the stomach and excluded participants who had previously undergone partial removal of the stomach and those having treatment for H pylori. 
Thirty‐four studies (4242 participants) used serology; 29 studies (2988 participants) used stool antigen test; 34 studies (3139 participants) used urea breath test‐13C; 21 studies (1810 participants) used urea breath test‐14C; and two studies (127 participants) used urea breath test but did not report the type of carbon used. Studies varied in the limit they used before saying a test was positive for H pylori infection and the type of stains used to examine the biopsy material. When we looked at all the data we found that urea breath tests were more accurate than blood and stool tests. The results mean that, on average, if 1000 people are tested, there will be 46 people without H pylori who will be misdiagnosed as having H pylori. Also, there will be 30, 42, 86, and 89 people with H pylori infection for whom the diagnosis of H pylori infection will be missed by urea breath test‐13C, urea breath test‐14C, serology, and stool antigen test, respectively. When we looked at the seven studies which compared urea breath test‐13C and serology, or urea breath test‐13C and stool antigen tests in the same participants, the results were uncertain and we cannot tell which test is more accurate. 
How reliable are the results of the studies? 
Except for one study, all the studies were of poor methodological quality, which makes their results unreliable. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
These results apply to children and adults with suspected H pylori infection, but only in those who have not previously undergone stomach operations and those who have not recently had antibiotics or treatment for H pylori infection. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Urea breath tests, blood tests, and stool tests may be suitable for identifying whether someone has H pylori infection. However, the level of the result of urea breath test, blood test, or stool test which should be used to make a diagnosis of H pylori infection remains unclear. 
How up‐to‐date is the review? 
We performed a thorough literature search for studies reporting the accuracy of these different tests until 4 March 2016.

Finding the Best and Easiest Test for a Stomach Germ Called *H. pylori*

### **Rationale**

**What is *H. pylori* and why is it a problem?**

*H. pylori* is a type of germ, or bacteria, that can live in a person's stomach. For many people, this germ does not cause any problems. But for some, it can lead to serious health issues.

These issues can include sores in the stomach lining, called ulcers. It can also cause heartburn and a bloated feeling. Over time, *H. pylori* can even increase the risk of some types of cancer, like stomach cancer. If a doctor finds *H. pylori* in your stomach, they can give you medicine to get rid of it. This can help prevent these health problems.

**Why was this study done?**

The most accurate way to check for *H. pylori* is with a test called an endoscopic biopsy. For this test, a doctor puts a thin, flexible tube down your throat and into your stomach. They use the tube to take a tiny piece of your stomach lining. This test works very well, but it can be uncomfortable and has some small risks.

There are other, easier tests that do not go inside your body. These tests are much more comfortable. They include:
*   A breath test
*   A blood test
*   A stool (poop) test

This study was done to see how well these three simple tests work. Researchers wanted to know if they are as accurate as the more difficult tube test.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. This means the researchers did not do a new experiment with new patients. Instead, they gathered and studied the results from 101 older studies that had already been completed.

These 101 studies included a total of more than 11,000 people. The people in the studies were both children and adults who were being tested for *H. pylori*. Most of them were having problems like heartburn.

Each of the older studies compared one of the simple tests to the more difficult tube test. By looking at all the studies together, the researchers hoped to find out which simple test was the most accurate at finding the *H. pylori* germ.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

After looking at all the data, the researchers found that the breath tests were more accurate than the blood tests or the stool tests.

To understand how accurate the tests were, imagine 1,000 people who really do have the *H. pylori* germ.
*   The **breath test** would miss the germ in about 30 to 42 of these people.
*   The **blood test** would miss the germ in about 86 of these people.
*   The **stool test** would miss the germ in about 89 of these people.

The tests can also make mistakes the other way. They can sometimes say a person has the germ when they do not. Out of 1,000 people who do not have the germ, any of these simple tests might incorrectly say that about 46 of them do have it.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

The researchers found a major problem. Most of the 101 studies they looked at were not done very well. This makes it hard to be sure about the results.

Because the old studies were of poor quality, we still cannot say for sure which simple test is best. The breath, blood, and stool tests may all be useful for finding *H. pylori*. However, we need more and better studies to know for sure. This will help doctors choose the best and most comfortable test for their patients.","Accuracy of different non‐invasive methods for identifying Helicobacter pylori 
Why is it important to know whether someone has Helicobacter pylori? 
Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) is a type of bacteria which may be present in the stomach of some people. H pylori is believed to cause a number of cancers, including stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, and throat cancer. H pylori is also linked with other diseases including stomach ulcers, heart burn, and a bloated feeling. If H pylori is found in an individual, appropriate treatment can be started. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To compare the accuracy of three different types of test for H pylori. These are: urea breath tests, blood tests (the specific blood test is called serology), and stool tests (in faeces). 
What was studied in this review? 
There are two types of urea breath test which use two different forms of carbon known as 13C and 14C, as well as multiple versions of serology and stool tests. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found 101 studies which included 11,003 people who were tested for H pylori. Of these 11,003 participants, 5839 (53.1%) had H pylori infection. All the studies used one of the three tests listed above and compared these test results with the diagnosis given by endoscopic biopsy.

In low‐ and middle‐income countries, postpartum haemorrhage is a major cause of maternal deaths and ill health. In high‐income countries, the problems are much less but there is still a small risk of major bleeding problems for women after giving birth. Active management of the third stage of labour, which is generally used to reduce blood loss at birth, consists of giving the mother a drug that helps the uterus to contract, early cord clamping and controlled cord traction to deliver the placenta. Different drugs have been tried and generally either intramuscular oxytocin or intramuscular syntometrine is given. Carbetocin is an oxytocin agonist. Oxytocin agonists are a group of drugs that mimic the oxytocin action, oxytocin being the natural hormone that helps to reduce blood loss at birth. This review includes 11 randomised controlled trials involving 2635 women. The trials compared carbetocin against either oxytocin or syntometrine given after delivery, vaginally or by caesarean section. The comparison between intramuscular carbetocin and oxytocin showed that there was no difference in the risk of heavy bleeding, but that women who received carbetocin were less likely to require other medications to produce uterine contractions following caesarean sections. Comparisons between carbetocin and syntometrine showed that women who received carbetocin had less blood loss compared to women who received syntometrine after vaginal delivery, and were much less likely to experience side effects such as nausea and vomiting. The incidence of hypertension at 30 and 60 minutes post delivery was also significantly lower in women who received carbetocin compared to those who received syntometrine. Five of the 11 studies were known to be supported by a pharmaceutical company. 
","**Plain Title**

Can a drug called carbetocin help stop heavy bleeding after giving birth?

**Rationale**

After a woman gives birth, she can sometimes bleed too much. Doctors call this postpartum hemorrhage. This heavy bleeding can be very dangerous. It is a main reason why new mothers get very sick or even die, especially in countries with fewer resources.

To prevent this, doctors give women a drug right after the baby is born. This drug helps the womb, or uterus, to squeeze tight. This squeezing action helps to stop the bleeding. The womb is the part of the body where the baby grows. The most common drugs used for this are called oxytocin and syntometrine.

This report looks at a different drug called carbetocin. Carbetocin works like the body's natural hormone, oxytocin. Hormones are special chemical messengers in our bodies. Doctors wanted to know if carbetocin works as well as or better than the other drugs. They also wanted to see if it had fewer side effects. Side effects are unwanted problems that a drug can cause.

**Trial Design**

This report looked at the results from 11 different studies. In these studies, doctors compared the drugs to see which one worked best. A total of 2,635 women who had just given birth took part in these studies. Some of the women had a vaginal birth. Others had a C-section. A C-section is an operation where the baby is born through a cut in the mother’s belly.

The women in the studies were put into groups by chance. This is a fair way to compare treatments. Right after giving birth, each woman got one shot of a drug in her muscle. Some women got carbetocin. Other women got oxytocin or syntometrine.

Doctors then watched the women to see how much they bled. They also checked for any side effects. For example, they checked the women's blood pressure 30 minutes and 60 minutes after they got the drug.

**Results**

The studies showed what happened when the drugs were compared.

First, doctors compared carbetocin to oxytocin. Both drugs worked well to prevent heavy bleeding. There was no real difference between them for this main goal. But for women who had a C-section, those who got carbetocin were less likely to need other drugs to help their womb squeeze tight.

Next, doctors compared carbetocin to syntometrine. After a vaginal birth, women who got carbetocin lost less blood than women who got syntometrine. Women who got carbetocin also had far fewer side effects. They were much less likely to feel sick to their stomach, throw up, or get high blood pressure.

These results show that carbetocin may be a good choice to stop bleeding after birth. It worked as well as one common drug and may mean women need fewer extra medicines. It worked better than another common drug to reduce blood loss and caused fewer side effects.

It is important to know who paid for the research. The report says that drug companies helped pay for 5 of the 11 studies.","Carbetocin for preventing postpartum haemorrhage

Key messages 
Anticholinergic medicines may increase the risk of death in older adults who have dementia.  However, the evidence is low certainty, and we cannot say for certain if the anticholinergic medicines cause death, or if they are simply more likely to be used by people who are already at an increased risk of dying due to ongoing health problems.  
We cannot draw firm conclusions for the risk that anticholinergic medicines pose to the development of other undesirable clinical outcomes, such as further deterioration of memory and thinking, or behavioural and psychological issues.  More research is needed to establish whether anticholinergic medicines cause unintended problems for older adults who have dementia. 
What are anticholinergic medicines? 
Medicines can be classified by their ability to block the action of a chemical signalling system in the body, called the cholinergic system. Medicines that do this are said to have anticholinergic effects, and therefore, are referred to as anticholinergic medicines. 
What did we want to find out?  
Anticholinergic medicines are commonly used to treat a number of medical conditions that people with dementia frequently experience. Typical examples are medicines used to treat urinary tract infections or episodes of agitation. However, because the cholinergic system in the brain plays an important role in learning, memory, and emotional regulation, there are theoretical reasons to believe that the use of anticholinergic medicines may unintentionally exacerbate psychological problems in this population. In this review, we investigated the link between anticholinergic medicines and future occurrence of undesirable clinical outcomes in people with dementia.  
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at the link between anticholinergic medicines and a range of clinical outcomes in people with dementia. We compared and summarised the results of identified studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors, such as study methods and sizes.  
What did we find? 
We found a total of 18 studies, involving 102,684 adults aged 50 years or more, who had issues with memory and thinking. We found that the evidence was highly inconsistent regarding the link between anticholinergic medicines and increased issues with memory and thinking in people with dementia. There were no studies that investigated the link between anticholinergic medicines and frequency of behavioural disturbances. Therefore, we could not draw any conclusions about whether anticholinergic medicines cause issues with memory and thinking, or behavioural disturbances in this population. However, we did find there was a more consistent link between anticholinergic medicines and the risk of death. Those who were taking anticholinergic medicines had a 15% higher risk of dying than those who were not taking anticholinergic medicines.   
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
The available evidence is very low certainty because of the inconsistency of study results, and the lack of control for health conditions that could be linked with both the clinical outcomes and the prescribing of anticholinergic medicines themselves. It is possible that anticholinergic medicines may not actually cause death, but are simply more likely to be given to people who are already at an increased risk of dying due to ongoing health problems.

### **Plain Title**

Do Certain Common Medicines Harm People with Dementia?

### **Rationale**

Dementia is a health problem that affects a person’s memory and thinking. People with dementia often have other health issues as well. For example, they may get bladder infections or feel agitated.

Doctors may give them medicines for these other health problems. Some of these common drugs work by blocking a chemical in the body. This chemical is very important for the brain. It helps with learning, memory, and controlling emotions.

These drugs are called anticholinergic (an-tee-ko-lin-ER-jik) medicines. Researchers were worried that blocking this key chemical might make memory problems worse in people with dementia. They also worried the drugs could cause other bad outcomes. This review was done to see if there is a real link between these drugs and future problems.

### **Trial Design**

This research was not a new study with patients. Instead, the team reviewed studies that were already done. They searched for all past studies that looked at this topic. They judged how strong the evidence from each study was. They looked at things like how the study was done and how many people were in it.

The team found 18 studies to review. Together, these studies included more than 100,000 adults. All the people in the studies were age 50 or older. They all had problems with memory and thinking, like dementia. The researchers gathered and compared the results from all these different studies. This helped them get a bigger picture of what the evidence says.

### **Results**

The researchers looked at how the drugs affected memory, behavior, and risk of death. For memory and thinking, the results from the different studies were mixed up. Some showed a link, but others did not. Because the studies did not agree, we still cannot say if these drugs make memory worse.

The team found no studies that looked at behavior problems, like agitation. So, we do not know if these drugs cause these kinds of issues.

However, the studies did show a more steady link with the risk of death. People with dementia who took these drugs had a higher chance of dying than those who did not take the drugs.

Even with this finding, the researchers warn that the evidence is not very strong. We cannot be sure that the drugs *caused* the deaths. It is very possible that people who are already sicker are more likely to be given these drugs. Their other serious health problems may be the real reason for their higher risk of death.

The main point is that more and better research is needed. This review, which looked at studies up to November 2021, helps doctors and patients know about the possible risks. It can help them talk about the best treatment choices.","The impact of cumulative medications with anticholinergic effects on future adverse clinical outcomes in people with dementia

10.1002-14651858.CD013189,"Background
Early accurate detection of all skin cancer types is essential to guide appropriate management and to improve morbidity and survival. Melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are high‐risk skin cancers, which have the potential to metastasise and ultimately lead to death, whereas basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is usually localised, with potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue. Anxiety around missing early cases needs to be balanced against inappropriate referral and unnecessary excision of benign lesions. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a microscopic imaging technique, which magnifies the surface of a skin lesion using near‐infrared light. Used in conjunction with clinical or dermoscopic examination of suspected skin cancer, or both, OCT may offer additional diagnostic information compared to other technologies. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of OCT for the detection of cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) in adults. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
We included studies of any design evaluating OCT in adults with lesions suspicious for invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants, BCC or cSCC, compared with a reference standard of histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). Our unit of analysis was lesions. Where possible, we estimated summary sensitivities and specificities using the bivariate hierarchical model. 
Main results
We included five studies with 529 cutaneous lesions (282 malignant lesions) providing nine datasets for OCT, two for visual inspection alone, and two for visual inspection plus dermoscopy. Studies were of moderate to unclear quality, using data‐driven thresholds for test positivity and giving poor accounts of reference standard interpretation and blinding. Studies may not have been representative of populations eligible for OCT in practice, for example due to high disease prevalence in study populations, and may not have reflected how OCT is used in practice, for example by using previously acquired OCT images. 
It was not possible to make summary statements regarding accuracy of detection of melanoma or of cSCC because of the paucity of studies, small sample sizes, and for melanoma differences in the OCT technologies used (high‐definition versus conventional resolution OCT), and differences in the degree of testing performed prior to OCT (i.e. visual inspection alone or visual inspection plus dermoscopy). 
Pooled data from two studies using conventional swept‐source OCT alongside visual inspection and dermoscopy for the detection of BCC estimated the sensitivity of OCT as 95% (95% confidence interval (CI) 91% to 97%) and specificity of 77% (95% CI 69% to 83%). 
When applied to a hypothetical population of 1000 lesions at the mean observed BCC prevalence of 60%, OCT would miss 31 BCCs (91 fewer than would be missed by visual inspection alone and 53 fewer than would be missed by visual inspection plus dermoscopy), and OCT would lead to 93 false‐positive results for BCC (a reduction in unnecessary excisions of 159 compared to using visual inspection alone and of 87 compared to visual inspection plus dermoscopy). 
Authors' conclusions
Insufficient data are available on the use of OCT for the detection of melanoma or cSCC. Initial data suggest conventional OCT may have a role for the diagnosis of BCC in clinically challenging lesions, with our meta‐analysis showing a higher sensitivity and higher specificity when compared to visual inspection plus dermoscopy. However, the small number of studies and varying methodological quality means implications to guide practice cannot currently be drawn. 
Appropriately designed prospective comparative studies are required, given the paucity of data comparing OCT with dermoscopy and other similar diagnostic aids such as reflectance confocal microscopy.

### **Plain Title**

Can a Special Light Scan Help Doctors Find Skin Cancer?

### **Rationale**

Skin cancer is a common health problem. Finding it early is the best way to treat it. There are a few types of skin cancer. Some types, like melanoma, are very serious. They can spread to other parts of the body. Other types, like basal cell carcinoma (BCC), are more common. They usually do not spread but can still harm the skin around them.

Doctors need to be sure when they look at a skin spot. They do not want to miss a cancer. But they also do not want to remove a harmless spot. Cutting out a harmless spot means a patient has surgery they do not need. This can cause scars and worry.

This study looks at a special tool called Optical Coherence Tomography, or OCT. OCT is like a special camera. It uses a safe, near-infrared light to see below the surface of the skin. This gives the doctor a much closer look at a skin spot. The researchers wanted to know if using OCT could help doctors be more certain if a spot is cancer. This could help find more real cancers and lead to fewer unneeded cuts.

### **Trial Design**

This study was a review. This means the researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they looked for all the studies that had already been done on OCT for skin cancer. They gathered all the information from these past studies to see what it showed when put together.

The studies they reviewed included adults who had a skin spot that might be cancer. In these studies, doctors used OCT to look at the spots. Then, they compared the OCT results with what doctors saw just by looking, sometimes with a special magnifying glass called a dermoscope.

To know for sure if a spot was cancer, a small piece of the spot was removed. It was then looked at under a microscope. This is the best way to know for sure. The researchers looked at studies that were published up to August 2016.

### **Results**

The researchers found only five good studies to look at. This is a small number of studies. Because of this, they could not find enough information about two types of skin cancer, melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). There was not enough proof to say if OCT helps find these types of cancer.

They found more information for the most common skin cancer, called basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The results for BCC were promising. The study showed that OCT was better at finding BCC than a doctor just looking at the skin, even with a special magnifying glass.

To make this easier to understand, think of 1,000 people with skin spots. Imagine 600 of these spots are BCC cancer.
*   If doctors used OCT, they would miss about 31 of the 600 cancers.
*   Without OCT, they would miss about 84 cancers. So, OCT helped find 53 more cancers that might have been missed.

OCT also helped doctors avoid cutting out harmless spots.
*   With OCT, doctors would wrongly remove about 93 harmless spots.
*   Without OCT, they would wrongly remove about 180 harmless spots. This means that using OCT helped avoid 87 unneeded surgeries.

In the end, the researchers believe that OCT may be a helpful tool for finding BCC. But we need more and better studies to be sure. Because there were only a few small studies, we cannot yet tell doctors to change how they check for skin cancer. More research is needed to know if OCT can help find all types of skin cancer.","What is the diagnostic accuracy of optical coherence tomography (OCT), an imaging test, for the detection of skin cancer in adults? 
Why is improving the diagnosis of skin cancer important? 
There are several different types of skin cancer. Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms, and it is important that it is recognised early so that it can be removed. If it is not recognised (also known as a false‐negative test result), treatment can be delayed, and this risks the melanoma spreading to other organs in the body, which may lead to eventual death. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) are usually localised (i.e. limited to a certain part of the body) skin cancers, although cSCC can spread to other parts of the body and BCC can cause disfigurement if not recognised early. Diagnosing a skin cancer when it is not actually present (a false‐positive result) may result in unnecessary surgery and other investigations and can cause stress and anxiety to the patient. Making the correct diagnosis is important, and mistaking one skin cancer for another can lead to the wrong treatment being used or lead to a delay in effective treatment. 
What is the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate optical coherence tomography (OCT) is for diagnosing skin cancer. Researchers in Cochrane included five studies to answer this question. Two studies were concerned with the diagnosis of melanoma and three with the diagnosis of BCC. 
What was studied in the review? 
A number of tools are available to skin cancer specialists which allow a more detailed examination of the skin compared to examination by the naked eye alone. Currently, a dermoscope is used by most skin cancer specialists, which magnifies the skin lesion (a mole or area of skin with an unusual appearance in comparison with the surrounding skin) using a bright light source. OCT magnifies the surface of a skin lesion to the level of that seen using a microscope using near‐infrared light. It is quick to perform but is more expensive compared to dermoscopy and requires specialist training. Review authors examined how useful OCT is to help diagnose skin cancers when used after visual inspection or visual inspection plus dermoscopy. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review included five studies: two studies with 97 participants with 133 skin lesions suspected of being melanoma, and three studies with 305 participants with 396 lesions suspected of being BCC of which one (50 lesions) also analysed cSCCs (nine lesions). 
The studies investigating the accuracy of OCT for diagnosing melanoma were small and too different from each other to allow a reliable estimate of the accuracy of OCT for melanoma to be made. Similarly, only one small, low‐quality study investigated the accuracy of OCT for diagnosing cSCC. 
For identifying BCC, two studies showed the effects of skin specialists using OCT after visual inspection alone, or visual inspection with dermoscopic examination. These two studies indicated that in theory, if OCT were to be used in a group of 1000 people with skin lesions that were particularly difficult to diagnose, of whom 600 (60%) actually had BCC, then: 
‐ an estimated 662 people would have an OCT result confirming that a BCC was present and of these 93 (14%) would not actually have had a BCC (false‐positive result); 
‐ of the 338 people with an OCT result indicating that no BCC was present, 31 (9%) would actually have a BCC (false‐negative result). 
Compared to making a diagnosis of BCC using visual inspection plus dermoscopy, the addition of OCT in this group would reduce the number of false‐positive results by 87 (thus reducing unnecessary surgical procedures) and would miss 53 fewer BCCs. 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
In all included studies, the diagnosis of skin cancer was made by lesion biopsy (OCT/dermoscopy positive) (a biopsy involves taking a sample of body cells and examining them under a microscope), and the absence of skin cancer was confirmed by biopsy (OCT/dermoscopy negative)*. This is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether people really had skin cancer. However, the small number of studies included in this review, and variability between them, reduced the reliability of findings. Included studies also had important limitations, in particular study participants were from more restricted groups than would be eligible for an OCT scan in practice (e.g. all studies included people with skin lesions that had already been selected for surgical removal), while the way in which OCT was used may not reflect real‐life situations. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies were conducted in Europe and the US only. Average age (reported in only two studies) was 46 years for melanoma and 63 years for BCC. The percentage of people with a final diagnosis of melanoma was 23% and 27% (in two studies), ranged from 58% to 61% for BCC (three studies), and was 18% for cSCC (one study). For the diagnosis of BCC, the results apply to people with 'pink' and non‐pigmented skin lesions that the clinician considers particularly difficult to diagnose by the naked eye alone. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Not enough research has been done on using OCT in detecting skin cancers. The results of this review suggest that OCT might help to diagnose BCC when it is difficult to distinguish it from benign skin lesions, but it is not yet clear whether it can adequately distinguish between BCC, cSCC, and melanoma skin cancers. More studies are needed comparing OCT to dermoscopy and to other microscopic techniques (such as reflectance confocal microscopy) in well‐described groups of people with suspicious skin lesions. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies biopsy or clinical follow‐up were the standard comparisons.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X‐linked recessive disorder characterised by progressive muscle weakness beginning in early childhood. Respiratory failure and weak cough develop in all patients as a consequence of muscle weakness leading to a risk of atelectasis, pneumonia, or the need for ventilatory support. There is no curative treatment for DMD. Corticosteroids are the only pharmacological intervention proven to delay the onset and progression of muscle weakness and thus respiratory decline in DMD. Antioxidant treatment has been proposed to try to reduce muscle weakness in general, and respiratory decline in particular.  
Objectives
To assess the effects of antioxidant agents on preventing respiratory decline in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy during the respiratory decline phase of the condition.  
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers to 23 March 2021, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. We included male patients with a diagnosis of DMD who had respiratory decline evidenced by a forced vital capacity (FVC%) less than 80% but greater than 30% of predicted values, receiving any antioxidant agent compared with other therapies for the management of DMD or placebo.  
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors screened studies for eligibility, assessed risk of bias of studies, and extracted data. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. The primary outcomes were FVC and hospitalisation due to respiratory infections. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, adverse events, change in muscle function, forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow (PEF).  
Main results
We included one study with 66 participants who were not co‐treated with corticosteroids, which was the only study to contribute data to our main analysis. We also included a study that enrolled 255 participants treated with corticosteroids, which was only available as a press release without numerical results. The studies were parallel‐group RCTs that assessed the effect of idebenone on respiratory function compared to placebo. The trial that contributed numerical data included patients with a mean (standard deviation) age of 14.3 (2.7) years at the time of inclusion, with a documented diagnosis of DMD or severe dystrophinopathy with clinical features consistent with typical DMD. The overall risk of bias across most outcomes was similar and judged as 'low'.  
Idebenone may result in a slightly less of a decline in FVC from baseline to one year compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) 3.28%, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.41 to 6.97; 64 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and probably has little or no effect on change in quality of life (MD −3.80, 95% CI −10.09 to 2.49; 63 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), range 0 to 100, 0 = worst, 100 = best quality of life). As a related but secondary outcome, idebenone may result in less of a decline from baseline in FEV1 (MD 8.28%, 95% CI 0.89 to 15.67; 53 participants) and PEF (MD 6.27%, 95% CI 0.61 to 11.93; 1 trial, 64 participants) compared to placebo. 
Idebenone was associated with fewer serious adverse events (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.04; 66 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and little to no difference in non‐serious adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.13; 66 participants; low‐certainty evidence) compared to placebo. Idebenone may result in little to no difference in change in arm muscle function (MD −2.45 N, 95% CI −8.60 to 3.70 for elbow flexors and MD −1.06 N, 95% CI −6.77 to 4.65 for elbow extensors; both 52 participants) compared to placebo. We found no studies evaluating the outcome hospitalisation due to respiratory infection.  
The second trial, involving 255 participants, for which data were available only as a press release without numerical data, was prematurely discontinued due to futility after an interim efficacy analysis based on FVC. There were no safety concerns. 
The certainty of the evidence was low for most outcomes due to imprecision and publication bias (the lack of a full report of the larger trial, which was prematurely terminated). 
Authors' conclusions
Idebenone is the only antioxidant agent tested in RCTs for preventing respiratory decline in people with DMD for which evidence was available for assessment. Idebenone may result in slightly less of a decline in FVC and less of a decline in FEV1 and PEF, but probably has little to no measurable effect on change in quality of life. Idebenone is associated with fewer serious adverse events than placebo. Idebenone may result in little to no difference in change in muscle function. 
Discontinuation due to the futility of the SIDEROS trial and its expanded access programmes may indicate that idebenone research in this condition is no longer needed, but we await the trial data. Further research is needed to establish the effect of different antioxidant agents on preventing respiratory decline in people with DMD during the respiratory decline phase of the condition.

Can an Antioxidant Drug Help with Breathing Problems in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy?

**Rationale**

Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, is a health problem that mostly affects boys. It is passed down through families. DMD causes muscles to get weaker over time, starting when boys are young.

As the muscles get weaker, it can become hard to breathe and cough. This can lead to serious lung sickness, like pneumonia. Patients may need help from a breathing machine.

Right now, the main drugs used to treat DMD are called steroids. Steroids can help slow down muscle weakness, but they are not a cure. Doctors are looking for new treatments to help protect the muscles. One idea is to use drugs called antioxidants. Researchers think these drugs might help reduce muscle damage.

This review looked at studies of an antioxidant drug called idebenone (pronounced eye-DEB-eh-known). The goal was to see if this drug could help slow down the breathing problems in people with DMD.

**Trial Design**

To answer their question, the researchers looked for the best kind of medical studies. These are called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, people are put into groups by chance.

The researchers found two studies that looked at idebenone for DMD. These studies included boys and young men with DMD who were already having some breathing problems. The average age of the boys in the main study was about 14 years old.

In the studies, one group of boys took the drug idebenone each day. The other group took a placebo. A placebo is a pill that looks like the real drug but has no medicine in it. It is sometimes called a sugar pill. Using a placebo helps researchers know for sure if the real drug is making a difference. The main study that gave results lasted for one year.

**Results**

The researchers found one small study that gave full results. This study had 66 boys in it. A second, much larger study with 255 boys was also found. However, that study was stopped early and did not publish its full results.

Here is what the small study found:

*   **Breathing:** The researchers measured how well the boys’ lungs worked. Boys who took idebenone had a slightly slower decline in their breathing ability compared to boys who took the sugar pill. This means their breathing still got weaker, but it happened a bit more slowly.

*   **Side Effects:** Side effects are unwanted health problems that can happen when you take a drug. There were fewer serious side effects in the group that took idebenone.

*   **Quality of Life:** The study measured how the boys felt about their health and daily lives. The drug did not seem to make a difference in their quality of life.

*   **Muscle Strength:** The drug also did not seem to change the strength in the boys’ arms.

The larger study was stopped early because the drug did not seem to be working as well as hoped. Because the full results from this big study were not shared, it is hard to be sure about the effects of idebenone.

Based on the small study, the researchers concluded that idebenone **may** offer a small benefit for breathing in people with DMD. However, the proof is not very strong. More research is needed to find other antioxidant drugs that may help treat the breathing problems caused by Duchenne.","Antioxidants to prevent respiratory decline in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy
Review question 
What are the effects (benefits and harms) of antioxidants for preventing breathing problems becoming worse in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)? 
Background 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an inherited condition where boys show signs of muscle weakness in early childhood that become worse over time. The muscles used in breathing become involved, which leads to shortness of breath and the need for artificial ventilation (a machine to support breathing). Treatment with antioxidants has been proposed to slow down the loss of muscle strength and the decline in breathing. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the evidence up to 23 March 2021. We included two studies in boys with DMD whose breathing was affected. Both studies compared the antioxidant medicine idebenone with a dummy medicine. One study included 66 participants between 10 and 18 years of age. The participants in this study were not receiving corticosteroids (medicines shown to be beneficial in DMD). The other study involved 255 children with DMD who were also taking corticosteroids. This study was stopped early for lack of benefit. The full results of the study are not yet available. 
Study funding sources 
The studies were sponsored by Santhera Pharmaceuticals, the maker of idebenone.
Key results 
Idebenone may result in slightly less of a decline in forced vital capacity (a measure of lung capacity), but probably has little or no effect on quality of life in patients with worsening breathing. Idebenone may result in less of a decline in the ability to force air out of the lungs and airways (based on tests of forced expiratory volume in the first second and peak expiratory flow). Idebenone was associated with fewer serious side effects than the dummy drug and has little or no effect on non‐serious side effects. Idebenone may have little or no effect on muscle function (arm strength). We found no studies that looked at hospitalisation due to respiratory infection. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall certainty of the evidence was low.

Typical and atypical antipsychotics are widely used to treat agitation and psychosis in dementia. However, whether or not they are beneficial is uncertain. Some trials have yielded negative results and effectiveness may be outweighed by harms. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of antipsychotics for the treatment of agitation and psychosis in people with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. 
Search methods
We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE (Ovid Sp), Embase (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization's meta‐register, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Portal on 7 January 2021. Two review authors independently screened the title and abstract of the hits, and two review authors assessed the full text of studies that got through this screening. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐arm trials comparing the effects of antipsychotics and placebo for the treatment of agitation or psychosis in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia, or both, irrespective of age, severity of cognitive impairment, and setting. (The majority of) participants had to have clinically significant agitation (including aggression) or psychosis or both at baseline. We excluded studies about antipsychotics that are no longer available in the USA or EU, or that are used for emergency short‐term sedation. We also excluded head‐to‐head trials and antipsychotic withdrawal trials. 
Data collection and analysis
The primary outcomes were (1) reduction in agitation or psychosis in participants with agitation or psychosis, respectively at baseline, and (2) the number of participants with adverse events: somnolence, extrapyramidal symptoms, any adverse event, any serious adverse event (SAE), and death. 
Two review authors independently extracted the necessary data and assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We calculated the pooled effect on agitation and psychosis for typical and atypical antipsychotics separately, and the pooled risk of adverse effects independent of the target symptom (agitation or psychosis). We used RevMan Web for the analyses. 
Main results
The search yielded 8233 separate hits. After assessing the full‐text of 35 studies, we included 24 trials that met the eligibility criteria. Six trials tested a typical antipsychotic, four for agitation and two for psychosis. Twenty trials tested an atypical antipsychotic, eight for agitation and 12 for psychosis. Two trials tested both drug types. Seventeen of 26 comparisons were performed in patients with Alzheimer’s disease specifically. The other nine comparisons also included patients with vascular dementia or mixed dementia. Together, the studies included 6090 participants (12 to 652 per study). The trials were performed in institutionalised, hospitalised and community‐dwelling patients, or a combination of those. 
For typical antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol, thiothixene), we are uncertain whether these drugs improve agitation compared with placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.57 to ‐0.15, 4 studies, n = 361); very low‐certainty evidence, but typical antipsychotics may improve psychosis slightly (SMD ‐0.29, 95% CI ‐0.55 to ‐0.03, 2studies, n= 240; low‐certainty evidence) compared with placebo. These drugs probably increase the risk of somnolence (risk ratio (RR) 2.62, 95% CI 1.51 to 4.56, 3 studies, n = 466; moderate‐certainty evidence) and increase extrapyramidal symptoms (RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.58 to 3.23, 3 studies, n = 467; high‐certainty) evidence. There was no evidence regarding the risk of any adverse event. The risks of SAEs (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.66, 1 study, n = 193) and death (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.54 to 4.00, 6 studies, n = 578) may be increased slightly, but these estimates were very imprecise, and the certainty was low. The effect estimates for haloperidol from five trials were in line with those of the drug class. 
Atypical antipsychotics (e.g. risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, quetiapine) probably reduce agitation slightly (SMD ‐0.21, 95% CI ‐0.30 to ‐0.12, 7 studies, n = 1971; moderate‐certainty evidence), but probably have a negligible effect on psychosis (SMD ‐0.11, 95% CI ‐0.18 to ‐0.03, 12 studies, n = 3364; moderate‐certainty evidence). These drugs increase the risk of somnolence (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.57 to 2.39, 13 studies, n ‐ 3878; high‐certainty evidence) and are probably also associated with slightly increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.68, 15 studies, n = 4180; moderate‐certainty evidence), serious adverse events (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.61, 15 studies, n= 4316; moderate‐certainty evidence) and death (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.05, 17 studies, n= 5032; moderate‐certainty evidence), although the latter estimate was imprecise. The drugs probably have a negligible effect on the risk of any adverse event (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09, 11 studies, n = 2785; moderate‐certainty evidence). The findings from seven trials for risperidone were in line with those for the drug class. 
Authors' conclusions
There is some evidence that typical antipsychotics might decrease agitation and psychosis slightly in patients with dementia. Atypical antipsychotics reduce agitation in dementia slightly, but their effect on psychosis in dementia is negligible. The apparent effectiveness of the drugs seen in daily practice may be explained by a favourable natural course of the symptoms, as observed in the placebo groups. Both drug classes increase the risk of somnolence and other adverse events. If antipsychotics are considered for sedation in patients with severe and dangerous symptoms, this should be discussed openly with the patient and legal representative.

Do Certain Drugs Help with Difficult Behaviors in Dementia?

### Rationale

Dementia is a health problem that affects the brain. It can make it hard for a person to think, remember, and do daily tasks. Sometimes, a person with dementia may feel very restless, upset, or angry. This is called agitation. They may also see or hear things that are not there. This is called psychosis.

Doctors may give drugs called antipsychotics to help with these behaviors. But these drugs can also cause side effects. Some side effects can be serious. We do not know for sure if the good things about these drugs are worth the bad things.

This study was done to find out. Researchers looked at past studies to see if these drugs are safe and if they really help people with dementia. They wanted to give a clear answer to help patients and doctors make better choices.

### Trial Design

This was not a new study with its own patients. Instead, researchers reviewed many studies that were already completed. They looked for studies that compared an antipsychotic drug to a fake pill, called a placebo. A placebo has no medicine in it.

In those studies, patients were put into groups by chance. One group took the real drug. The other group took the placebo. This is the best way to see if a drug truly works.

The researchers looked at 24 different studies. In total, these studies included over 6,000 people. All the people in the studies had dementia from Alzheimer's disease or from problems with blood flow to the brain. They all had agitation or psychosis that was serious enough to need treatment.

### Results

The study looked at two types of these drugs. One type is called 'typical' antipsychotics. The other type is called 'atypical' antipsychotics. The researchers found that the benefits of these drugs were small, and the risks were real.

**What did the study find about older, ‘typical’ drugs?**

These are older drugs. The study found that:
*   We are not sure if they help with agitation.
*   They may help a little bit with psychosis.
*   But these drugs caused side effects. People who took them were more than 2 times as likely to feel very sleepy. They were also more than 2 times as likely to have movement problems. This can look like shaking, stiffness, or slow movements.
*   The risk for serious health problems or death may have been slightly higher, but the researchers were not certain about this.

**What did the study find about newer, ‘atypical’ drugs?**

These are newer drugs. The study found that:
*   They probably help a little bit with agitation.
*   They likely have no real effect on psychosis.
*   These drugs also caused side effects. People who took them were almost 2 times as likely to feel very sleepy. They also had a slightly higher risk of movement problems.
*   The risk of serious health problems and death was also slightly higher for people taking these drugs.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

The researchers who did this review learned a few key things. They found that any help from either type of drug is small.

They also noticed that many people who took the fake pill got better over time. This suggests that these difficult behaviors can sometimes improve on their own, without strong drugs.

Because the benefits are small and the risks are real, doctors, patients, and families must be very careful. Before deciding to use these drugs, they should have an open talk about the good and bad things that can happen. This helps everyone make the best choice for the person with dementia.","Do antipsychotic medicines reduce  agitated behaviour and psychotic symptoms in people with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia? 
 
Key messages 
It is uncertain whether older, first‐generation or ‘typical’ antipsychotic medicines such as haloperidol have an effect on agitated behaviour (for example, restlessness and aggression); the effect is moderate at best. Typical antipsychotic medicines may decrease delusions and hallucinations slightly in people with dementia.  
Newer, second‐generation ‘atypical’ antipsychotic medicines, such as risperidone, probably reduce agitated behaviour slightly. Atypical antipsychotic medicines probably have no effect on psychotic symptoms.  
Both first‐ and second‐generation antipsychotic medicines increase the risk of drowsiness and other unwanted events. When patients’ symptoms improve after antipsychotics have been prescribed, this is probably largely due to natural improvement in symptoms over time. 
What are antipsychotic medicines? 
Antipsychotics are medicines prescribed to treat psychotic symptoms and severely disturbed behaviour in some mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and severe depression. Psychotic symptoms are delusions (very strongly held beliefs in something which is not true) and hallucinations (sensing – usually seeing or hearing ‐ things which are not really there). 
Antipsychotic medicines are often divided into two groups:
1. first‐generation (older) or ‘typical’ antipsychotics, for example haloperidol;
2. second‐generation (newer) or ‘atypical’ antipsychotics, for example risperidone.
Both types can cause unwanted effects, such as drowsiness, movement disorders (for example, involuntary or uncontrollable movements, tremors, muscle contractions) and weight gain. 
Why do people with dementia need antipsychotics? 
People with dementia quite often experience hallucinations and delusions during their illness for some time. Particularly in the later stages of the illness, they may also show agitated behaviours such as restlessness, shouting out or aggression towards others. It is important to try to understand what is driving these behaviours and there are many ways to manage them which do not involve drugs. However, antipsychotic medicines have often been prescribed to people with dementia for these problems. In many countries, they are prescribed less often than in the past but are still used when the symptoms are severe. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know how well antipsychotic medicines reduce the severity of agitation and psychotic symptoms in people with the two commonest types of dementia, namely dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia. We also wanted to know how many people experienced unwanted effects. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that investigated antipsychotic medicines currently available in the USA or European Union by comparing them with placebo (a ’dummy’ pill), for treatment of persistent agitation or psychotic symptoms. People in the studies had to have Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia. They could be any age and reside in a care home, a hospital, or the community. Most of the people in the studies had to be experiencing agitation (including aggression) or psychotic symptoms, or both, at the start of the study. 
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found 24 studies with a total of 6090 people:
‐ six studies tested typical antipsychotics, mostly haloperidol; 
‐ 20 studies tested atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole; and  
‐ two studies tested both typical and atypical antipsychotics.
All the studies compared antipsychotics with placebo. The people were living in institutions, hospitals, the community, or a combination of these settings. 
Main results 
Typical antipsychotics (haloperidol, thiothixene) compared with placebo:
‐ may improve symptoms of psychosis slightly (2 studies, 240 people), but we are uncertain about their effect on agitation (4 studies, 361 people);  
‐ probably increase the risk of drowsiness (3 studies, 466 people), and movement disorders (3 studies, 467 people);  
‐ may slightly increase the risk of serious unwanted effects (1 study, 193 people) and of death (6 studies, 578 people).  
There was no evidence about the risk of non‐serious and serious unwanted effects combined.
Atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, quetiapine) compared with placebo: 
‐ probably slightly reduce agitation (7 studies, 1971 people) and may slightly reduce aggression (1 study, 301 people), but probably make no important difference to symptoms of psychosis (12 studies, 3364 people); 
‐ increase the risk of drowsiness (13 studies, 2878 people) and probably slightly increase movement disorders (15 studies, 4180 people); 
‐ probably slightly increase the risk of experiencing any non‐serious or serious unwanted effect combined, the risk of serious unwanted effects, and the risk of death (17 studies, 5032 people). 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Overall, our confidence in the evidence about typical antipsychotics is limited and our confidence in the evidence about atypical antipsychotics moderate. Typical antipsychotics have been investigated in just a few studies. In addition, the studies about typical and atypical antipsychotics did not always use the best methods to carry out their investigations, or did not report the results. Consequently, the effects on agitation or psychosis may have been overestimated, and the effects on adverse events underestimated. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to 7 January 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013826.pub2,"Background
Aerosols and spatter are generated in a dental clinic during aerosol‐generating procedures (AGPs) that use high‐speed hand pieces. Dental healthcare providers can be at increased risk of transmission of diseases such as tuberculosis, measles and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) through droplets on mucosae, inhalation of aerosols or through fomites on mucosae, which harbour micro‐organisms. There are ways to mitigate and contain spatter and aerosols that may, in turn, reduce any risk of disease transmission. In addition to personal protective equipment (PPE) and aerosol‐reducing devices such as high‐volume suction, it has been hypothesised that the use of mouth rinse by patients before dental procedures could reduce the microbial load of aerosols that are generated during dental AGPs. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of preprocedural mouth rinses used in dental clinics to minimise incidence of infection in dental healthcare providers and reduce or neutralise contamination in aerosols. 
Search methods
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 4 February 2022. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials and excluded laboratory‐based studies. Study participants were dental patients undergoing AGPs. Studies compared any preprocedural mouth rinse used to reduce contaminated aerosols versus placebo, no mouth rinse or another mouth rinse. Our primary outcome was incidence of infection of dental healthcare providers and secondary outcomes were reduction in the level of contamination of the dental operatory environment, cost, change in mouth microbiota, adverse events, and acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors screened search results, extracted data from included studies, assessed the risk of bias in the studies and judged the certainty of the available evidence. We used mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as the effect estimate for continuous outcomes, and random‐effects meta‐analysis to combine data  
Main results
 We included 17 studies with 830 participants aged 18 to 70 years. We judged three trials at high risk of bias, two at low risk and 12 at unclear risk of bias.  
None of the studies measured our primary outcome of the incidence of infection in dental healthcare providers.  
The primary outcome in the studies was reduction in the level of bacterial contamination measured in colony‐forming units (CFUs) at distances of less than 2 m (intended to capture larger droplets) and 2 m or more (to capture droplet nuclei from aerosols arising from the participant's oral cavity). It is unclear what size of CFU reduction represents a clinically significant amount. 
There is low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence that chlorhexidine (CHX) may reduce bacterial contamination, as measured by CFUs, compared with no rinsing or rinsing with water. There were similar results when comparing cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) with no rinsing and when comparing CPC, essential oils/herbal mouthwashes or boric acid with water. There is very low‐certainty evidence that tempered mouth rinses may provide a greater reduction in CFUs than cold mouth rinses. There is low‐certainty evidence that CHX may reduce CFUs more than essential oils/herbal mouthwashes. The evidence for other head‐to‐head comparisons was limited and inconsistent.  
The studies did not provide any information on costs, change in micro‐organisms in the patient's mouth or adverse events such as temporary discolouration, altered taste, allergic reaction or hypersensitivity. The studies did not assess acceptability of the intervention to patients or feasibility of implementation for dentists.  
Authors' conclusions
None of the included studies measured the incidence of infection among dental healthcare providers. The studies measured only reduction in level of bacterial contamination in aerosols. None of the studies evaluated viral or fungal contamination. We have only low to very low certainty for all findings. We are unable to draw conclusions regarding whether there is a role for preprocedural mouth rinses in reducing infection risk or the possible superiority of one preprocedural rinse over another. Studies are needed that measure the effect of rinses on infectious disease risk among dental healthcare providers and on contaminated aerosols at larger distances with standardised outcome measurement. 
","Here is the Plain Language Summary of the biomedical study:

### **Plain Title**

Can a Mouth Rinse Before a Dental Visit Protect the Dental Team?

### **Rationale**

When you go to the dentist, some tools create a fine spray. This spray is made of tiny drops of water and spit from your mouth. The spray is also called an aerosol.

This spray can carry germs like bacteria. These germs can float in the air. This could put the dental team, like your dentist and hygienist, at risk of getting sick.

Dental teams already wear masks and use suction tools to stay safe. But researchers wanted to know if a mouth rinse could also help. The idea was that if a patient uses a mouth rinse, it could lower the number of germs in their mouth. This might mean fewer germs get into the air during dental work. This study was done to look at past research to see if this idea is true.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked for studies that were already done. They combined the results from many studies to try to get a stronger answer.

The researchers found 17 studies to look at. These studies included a total of 830 adult patients. The patients were between 18 and 70 years old. They were all getting dental work that creates a spray.

In these studies, some patients used a mouth rinse before their dental work. Other patients used a rinse with no medicine in it, just water, or no rinse at all. The studies then compared the results. The researchers wanted to find out if using a rinse meant fewer dental workers got sick. They also wanted to know if the rinse lowered the number of germs in the air.

### **Results**

The researchers could not answer their main question. None of the 17 studies they looked at checked to see if dental workers actually got sick less often. This was the most important information they were looking for.

Instead, the studies only measured the number of bacteria in the air. They did this by collecting the spray from the air and counting how many bacteria grew from it. The studies did not look for other germs, like viruses.

The studies found that some mouth rinses might lower the amount of bacteria in the air. This was true for rinses with chlorhexidine or cetylpyridinium chloride. But the proof for this was very weak. The researchers were not very sure about these results.

The studies did not look at other important things. They did not report on the cost of using rinses. They did not check for side effects, like changes in taste or stained teeth. They also did not ask if patients or dentists found it easy to use the rinses.

Because the proof was so weak, the researchers could not make any firm conclusions. They cannot say if using a mouth rinse before a dental visit helps protect the dental team from getting sick. They also cannot say if one kind of rinse is better than another. The researchers said that better studies are needed to find the right answers.","Does use of mouth rinse before a dental procedure reduce the risk of infection transmission from patient to health professional? 
Why is this question important? 
Many dental procedures generate droplets that settle on a surface quickly. If high‐speed instruments, such as a drill, are used, aerosols are generated, which consist of tiny particles that remain suspended in the air and that can be inhaled or that settle farther away on surfaces. These aerosols contain a variety of micro‐organisms and may transmit infections either through direct contact or indirectly through the contaminated surfaces. To prevent the spread of infection, it may help to reduce the number of micro‐organisms that are present in these aerosols. The use of mouth rinses before a dental procedure ('preprocedural mouth rinse') has been suggested as a possible way to reduce the amount of contamination of these aerosols. Chlorhexidine, povidone iodine and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) are some of the commonly used mouth rinses. They act by killing or inactivating the micro‐organisms in the mouth and thereby reducing the level of contamination in the aerosol that is generated. We wanted to find out whether rinsing the mouth before a dental procedure reduces the contamination of aerosols produced during dental procedures in practice and helps prevent the transmission of infectious diseases. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? 
We searched for all relevant studies that compared mouth rinses used before dental procedures against placebo (fake treatment), no intervention or another mouth rinse considered to be inactive. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed our confidence in the evidence. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes and consistency of findings across studies. 
What did we find? 
We found 17 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies used chlorhexidine, CPC, essential oil/herbal mouth rinses, povidone iodine and boric acid in comparison to no rinsing, or rinsing with water, saline (salt water) or another mouth rinse. None of the studies measured the how often dental healthcare providers became infected with micro‐organisms. All the included studies measured the level of bacterial contamination in droplets or aerosols in the dental clinic. They did not examine contamination with viruses or fungi.  
Most rinses decreased bacterial contamination in aerosols to some extent, but there was considerable variation in the effects and we do not know what size of reduction is necessary to reduce infection risk.  
The studies did not provide any information on costs, change in micro‐organisms in the patient's mouth or side effects such as temporary discolouration, altered taste, allergic reaction or hypersensitivity. The studies did not assess whether patients were happy to use a mouth rinse or whether it was easy for dentists to implement.  
Overall, the results suggest that using a preprocedural mouth rinse may reduce the level of bacterial contamination in aerosols compared with no rinsing or rinsing with water, but we have only low or very low certainty that the evidence is reliable and we do not know how this reduction in contamination relates to the risk of infection. 
What does this mean? 
We have very little confidence in the evidence, and further studies may change the findings of our review. No studies measured infection risk or investigated viral or fungal contamination.  
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to February 2022.

Review question 
Is cryotherapy (cooling) beneficial or harmful for local destruction of cancer (tumours) spread to the liver? 
Background 
When cancer spreads in the body (metastasis), one of the most common sites is the liver. Besides cancers of the liver (primary liver cancer), liver metastases from colorectal cancer are the most common cancer affecting the liver. More than half of people who have cancer spread to the liver die from complications. Cryotherapy is one of methods, used to destroy metastases in the liver. This method requires placing a special probe near the cancer site. The probe is used to deliver extreme cold to the site, which is produced by liquid nitrogen or argon gas. Placement of the probe can be guided using ultrasound or computed tomography (a special x‐ray). The rapid freezing process kills the cancer cells, and the size of the cancer is reduced. However, it is not clear if this treatment prolongs life or increases quality of life of affected people. 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of cryotherapy in destroying cancer metastases in the liver. We searched for studies assessing the effect of cryotherapy in comparison with no treatment or any other treatment in people with liver metastases from cancer of any location. We aimed to assess the effect of cryotherapy on the risk of death, quality of life, and adverse events (side effects caused by the treatment). 
Study characteristics 
We last searched for evidence in June 2018. We included only one trial conducted in Ukraine, and participants' primary cancer was colorectal (bowel) cancer in 66% of instances, but there were also people with stomach, breast, skin, and other tumours. All of them had cancer spread to the liver. In this trial, 123 participants were allocated at random to receive either cryotherapy (63 people) or conventional surgery (affected parts of the liver were removed; 60 people). 
Funding 
The trial did not provide information on funding.
Key results 
The trial was at high risk of bias. The participants were followed for up to 10 years (minimum five months). The trial reported that the mortality at 10 years was 81% (51/63) in the cryotherapy group and 92% (55/60) in the conventional surgery group. We judged the evidence as low‐certainty evidence. We found no evidence of a difference in proportion of participants with recurrence of the malignancy in the liver: 86% (54/63) of the participants in the cryotherapy group and 95% (57/60) of the participants in the conventional surgery group developed a new malignancy (low‐certainty evidence). The frequency of reported complications was similar between the cryotherapy group and the conventional surgery group, except for postoperative pain. Both insignificant and pronounced pain were reported to be more common in the cryotherapy group while intense pain was reported to be more common in the conventional surgery group. However, it was not reported whether there was any evidence of a difference. The frequency of unwanted effects (adverse events or complications) was mostly similar in both groups, but pain intensity and frequency seemed to differ between the groups. There were no intervention‐related mortality or bile leakages. The trial did not provide data on quality of life; cancer mortality, and time to progression of liver metastases. 
Reliability of the evidence 
The evidence for the effectiveness of cryotherapy versus conventional surgery in people with liver metastases is of low certainty. We are uncertain about our estimate and cannot determine whether cryotherapy compared with conventional surgery is beneficial or harmful. We found no evidence for the benefits or harms of cryotherapy compared with no intervention, or versus systemic treatments.

### **Plain Title**

Comparing a Freezing Treatment to Surgery for Cancer in the Liver

### **Rationale**

Sometimes, cancer can spread from where it first started to other parts of the body. A common place for cancer to spread is the liver. When cancer spreads to the liver, it can be very serious. It is a major health problem for people with cancer.

Doctors are always looking for better ways to treat cancer in the liver. One treatment uses extreme cold to kill cancer cells. This is called cryotherapy, which is like a ""freezing treatment"". A doctor puts a special tool, like a thin needle, near the cancer. This tool uses a very cold gas to freeze the cancer cells and destroy them. This can help make the cancer smaller.

The usual treatment for this is surgery to cut out the part of the liver that has cancer. Researchers wanted to know if the freezing treatment was better, worse, or the same as surgery. They wanted to see if it helped people live longer or feel better. This study was done to compare the two treatments.

### **Trial Design**

This summary looks at the results from one study. The study took place in a country called Ukraine. It included 123 people. All of them had cancer that had spread to their liver. For most of these people, the cancer first started in their bowel. For others, it started in the stomach, breast, or skin.

The research team split the people into two groups by chance. This is like flipping a coin. Putting people into groups by chance is a fair way to compare treatments.

One group had 63 people. They received the freezing treatment for the cancer in their liver. The other group had 60 people. They had regular surgery to remove the cancer from their liver. The research team watched all the people in the study for a long time. They checked on them for up to 10 years to see how they were doing.

### **Results**

The researchers who reviewed the study said the proof from it was not very strong. They called it ""low-certainty evidence"". This means we cannot be sure that the results are correct. We need more research to know for sure what is best for patients.

Here is what the study found:

*   **How long people lived:** The study looked at how many people in each group had died after 10 years. In the freezing treatment group, about 8 out of 10 people had died. In the surgery group, about 9 out of 10 people had died. Because the proof is not strong, we cannot say if one treatment helped people live longer than the other.

*   **Cancer coming back:** The study also checked if the cancer came back in the liver. The cancer came back for most people in both groups. This happened to about 9 out of 10 people in the freezing group and about 9 out of 10 people in the surgery group. Again, we are not sure if there is a real difference between the groups.

*   **Side effects:** The study also looked at unwanted problems from the treatments. Most side effects were the same in both groups. The main difference was the type of pain people felt after the treatment. People who had the freezing treatment had more mild pain. People who had surgery had more strong pain. No one died from problems caused by their treatment.

The study did not report on how the treatments affected people’s quality of life, like how they felt in their daily lives.

In the end, the researchers could not say if the freezing treatment is better or worse than surgery. The results are not clear enough to know for sure. This means that we need more and better studies to find a clear answer for patients.","Cryotherapy for liver metastases

10.1002-14651858.CD011462.pub2,"Use of shorter radiation treatments for prostate cancer
Review question 
We asked if giving radiation therapy (cancer treatment with high energy x‐rays) for localized prostate cancer in fewer fractions (treatment visits for radiation) and shorter overall treatment time with a larger dose (more than 2 Gray) given each day, works as well as the usual (conventional) number of fractions (1.8 Gray per day to 2 Gray per day) for cancer control and had similar side effects. 
Background 
Using fewer fractions, with a larger dose given at each visit is possibly better for treating prostate cancer with radiation. Radiation therapy for prostate cancer can cause bladder and bowel side effects, and affect sexual function. If using larger doses for each treatment, with fewer treatments overall (called hypofractionation), works as well for cancer control, and the side effects and effects on certainty of life are about the same, then hypofractionation may benefit men with prostate cancer contained within the prostate (localized) who are treated with radiation therapy. If cancer control is as good, and the side effects about the same, then using fewer (but larger dose) radiation treatments may be more convenient for men with prostate cancer, use fewer resources and save money. 
Study characteristics 
This evidence is current to 15 March 2019. The men studied were ages 64 years and over and had prostate cancer limited to the pelvis. 
Key results 
We studied the use of fewer, but larger doses of radiation to treat 8278 men with prostate cancer. We found 10 studies. 
We found that using hypofractionation may result in similar risk of dying from prostate cancer (low‐certainty evidence) but are uncertain how it affects late bowel side effects (very low‐certainty evidence). It probably results in similar rates of late bladder side effects (moderate‐certainty evidence).

### **Plain Title**

A Study of Shorter Radiation Treatments for Prostate Cancer

### **Rationale**

**What is prostate cancer?**

Prostate cancer is a type of cancer that grows in the prostate. The prostate is a small gland found only in men. This study looked at prostate cancer that is only in the prostate area. This means the cancer has not spread to other parts of the body.

**How is prostate cancer treated?**

One common way to treat prostate cancer is with radiation. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. The normal way to give radiation is over many weeks. A person might go to the hospital every weekday for treatment. This can be a burden for patients and their families. It takes a lot of time and travel.

**Why was this study done?**

Doctors wanted to know if a shorter treatment plan could work just as well. This shorter plan is called hypofractionation. It uses fewer radiation treatments. But, each treatment uses a stronger dose of radiation.

If this shorter plan works just as well and is safe, it could be a big help. It would mean fewer trips to the hospital. This could make life easier for men getting treatment. It could also save time and money for the healthcare system.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new medical trial. Instead, researchers looked for studies that were already done. They found 10 good studies to review. They combined all the results from these studies. This helps them get a stronger answer to their question. The information they used was current as of March 2019.

**Who was in these studies?**

The 10 studies included over 8,000 men with prostate cancer. The men were about 64 years of age or older. All the men had cancer that was only in the prostate area.

In the studies, the men were split into two groups. One group got the standard, longer radiation treatment. The other group got the new, shorter radiation treatment. The researchers then compared what happened to the men in both groups.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The researchers looked at two main things. First, they looked at how well the shorter treatment controlled the cancer. Second, they looked at the side effects of the treatment.

**Did the shorter treatment work?**

Yes. The shorter treatment plan worked just as well as the standard plan. Men who got the shorter treatment lived just as long overall. The risk of dying from prostate cancer was about the same in both groups. The risk of the cancer spreading to other parts of the body also seemed to be similar. The researchers were very sure about these results.

**What were the side effects?**

Radiation treatment can sometimes cause problems with the bladder or bowel. The researchers compared these side effects between the two groups.

The risk of bladder problems was about the same for both the short and long treatment plans. The researchers were quite sure about this. They were less sure about bowel problems. More research may be needed to be certain about the long-term effects on the bowel.

**What do these results mean?**

The researchers concluded that the shorter radiation plan is a good option for many men. It controls prostate cancer just as well as the standard, longer plan. The side effects for the bladder seem to be similar.

For patients, this is good news. It means they can get a treatment that is just as effective but much more convenient. Having fewer trips to the hospital can make a big difference during a difficult time.","Use of shorter radiation treatments for prostate cancer

10.1002-14651858.CD013453.pub2,"Background
Targeted therapies directed at specific driver oncogenes have improved outcomes for individuals with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Approximately 5% of lung adenocarcinomas, the most common histologic subtype of NSCLC, harbour rearrangements in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene leading to constitutive activity of the ALK kinase. Crizotinib was the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) demonstrated to be effective in advanced NSCLC. Next‐generation ALK TKIs have since been developed including ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, ensartinib, and lorlatinib, and have been compared with crizotinib or chemotherapy in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). These ALK‐targeted therapies are currently used in clinical practice and are endorsed in multiple clinical oncology guidelines. 
Objectives
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of ALK inhibitors given as monotherapy to treat advanced ALK‐rearranged NSCLC. 
Search methods
We conducted electronic searches in the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Embase. We also searched conference proceedings from the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO), European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO), and International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) World Conference on Lung Cancer, as well as the reference lists of retrieved articles. All searches were conducted from 2007 until 7 January 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing ALK inhibitors with cytotoxic chemotherapy or another ALK inhibitor in individuals with incurable locally advanced or metastatic pathologically confirmed ALK‐rearranged NSCLC. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, extracted study characteristics and outcome data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for each included study. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Primary outcomes were progression‐free survival (PFS) and adverse events (AE); secondary outcomes were overall survival (OS), OS at one year, overall response rate (ORR) by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours) criteria, and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). We performed a meta‐analysis for all outcomes, where appropriate, using the fixed‐effect model. We reported hazard ratios (HR) for PFS, OS, and a composite HRQoL of life outcome (time to deterioration), and risk ratios (RR) for AE, ORR, and one‐year OS. We presented 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) and used the I² statistic to investigate heterogeneity. We planned comparisons of 'ALK inhibitor versus chemotherapy' and 'next‐generation ALK inhibitor versus crizotinib’ with subgroup analysis by type of ALK inhibitor, line of treatment, and baseline central nervous system involvement. 
Main results
Eleven studies (2874 participants) met our inclusion criteria: six studies compared an ALK inhibitor (crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib) to chemotherapy, and five studies compared a next‐generation ALK inhibitor (alectinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib) to crizotinib. We assessed the evidence for most outcomes as of moderate to high certainty. Most studies were at low risk for selection, attrition, and reporting bias; however, no RCTs were blinded, resulting in a high risk of performance and detection bias for outcomes reliant on subjective measurement. 
ALK inhibitor versus chemotherapy 
Treatment with ALK inhibitors resulted in a large increase in PFS compared to chemotherapy (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.52, 6 RCTs, 1611 participants, high‐certainty evidence). This was found regardless of line of treatment. 
ALK inhibitors may result in no difference in overall AE rate when compared to chemotherapy (RR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.03, 5 RCTs, 1404 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
ALK inhibitors slightly improved OS (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97, 6 RCTs, 1611 participants, high‐certainty evidence), despite most included studies having a significant number of participants crossing over from chemotherapy to receive an ALK inhibitor after the study period. 
ALK inhibitors likely increase ORR (RR 2.43, 95% CI 2.16 to 2.75, 6 RCTs, 1611 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) including in measurable baseline brain metastases (RR 4.88, 95% CI 2.18 to 10.95, 3 RCTs, 108 participants) when compared to chemotherapy. ALK inhibitors result in a large increase in the HRQoL measure, time to deterioration (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.60, 5 RCTs, 1504 participants, high‐certainty evidence) when compared to chemotherapy. 
Next‐generation ALK inhibitor versus crizotinib 
Next‐generation ALK inhibitors resulted in a large increase in PFS (HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.46, 5 RCTs, 1263 participants, high‐certainty evidence), particularly in participants with baseline brain metastases. 
Next‐generation ALK inhibitors likely result in no difference in overall AE (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.01, 5 RCTs, 1263 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) when compared to crizotinib. 
Next‐generation ALK inhibitors likely increase OS (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.90, 5 RCTs, 1263 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) and slightly increase ORR (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.25, 5 RCTs, 1229 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) including a response in measurable brain metastases (RR 2.45, 95% CI 1.7 to 3.54, 4 RCTs, 138 participants) when compared to crizotinib. 
Studies comparing ALK inhibitors were conducted exclusively or partly in the first‐line setting. 
Authors' conclusions
Next‐generation ALK inhibitors including alectinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib are the preferred first systemic treatment for individuals with advanced ALK‐rearranged NSCLC. Further trials are ongoing including investigation of first‐line ensartinib. Next‐generation inhibitors have not been compared to each other, and it is unknown which should be used first and what subsequent treatment sequence is optimal.

### **Plain Title**

Finding the Best Medicines for a Certain Type of Lung Cancer

### **Rationale**

**What is this study about?**

Lung cancer is a serious illness. For some people, lung cancer is caused by a change in one of their genes. A gene is a set of instructions for your body. This study looked at a gene called ALK. When the ALK gene has a certain change, it can make cancer cells grow out of control.

There are special medicines that can treat this type of lung cancer. These medicines are called ALK inhibitors. They work by blocking the faulty ALK gene to stop the cancer from growing. These are a type of ""targeted therapy"" because they target a specific cause of the cancer.

**Why did we do this study?**

Doctors have several ALK inhibitor medicines to choose from. An older one is called crizotinib. Many newer ALK medicines have also been made. Researchers wanted to find out which medicines work best for people with this type of lung cancer.

This study compared ALK medicines to older treatments like chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a type of medicine that kills fast-growing cells. The study also compared the newer ALK medicines to the older ALK medicine. The goal was to find the best first medicine to give to a patient.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at studies that were already done. They found 11 high-quality studies and combined their results. Looking at many studies together can give a stronger and more reliable answer.

The studies included a total of 2,874 people. All of them had a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer. Their cancer had spread and was caused by the ALK gene change.

The researchers reviewed two types of comparisons from these studies.
*   One group of studies compared an ALK medicine to chemotherapy.
*   Another group of studies compared a new ALK medicine to the older ALK medicine, crizotinib.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The study showed that ALK medicines are better than chemotherapy for this type of lung cancer.
*   People who took an ALK medicine lived much longer without their cancer getting worse.
*   ALK medicines were much better at shrinking cancer tumors. This was also true for cancer that had spread to the brain.
*   People who took ALK medicines felt well for a longer time. They also lived longer overall.

The study also found that the newer ALK medicines are better than the older one, crizotinib.
*   The new ALK medicines stopped cancer from growing for a much longer time. This was a big benefit for people with cancer in the brain.
*   People taking the new medicines were more likely to live longer.
*   The new medicines were also a bit better at shrinking tumors.
*   The number of side effects was about the same for the new and older ALK medicines.

**What do these results mean?**

The researchers concluded that the new ALK medicines are the best choice to start treatment. These medicines include alectinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib. They work much better than chemotherapy and are better than the first ALK medicine.

For people with advanced lung cancer caused by an ALK gene change, these new medicines offer a better way to control the cancer and live longer. We still need more research to know which of the new drugs is the very best, or the best order to use them in.","Targeted treatment of non‐small cell lung cancer with an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene mutation 
Background 
The most common type of lung cancer is non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). About 5% of NSCLC will be driven by a gene mutation known as anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Targeted treatments for those with advanced (not curable) ALK‐mutated NSCLC cancer have been developed and found to be more effective than chemotherapy. The first ALK inhibitor to be developed was crizotinib. Newer ALK‐targeted drugs have also been developed and include ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, ensartinib, and lorlatinib. In this review we looked at treatments that target ALK‐mutated NSCLC to find out how well they work. 
Objectives  
The primary objective of this review was to find out whether people with ALK‐mutated NSCLC given treatments targeted towards ALK live longer without recurrence and have fewer side effects than those treated with chemotherapy. We also planned to evaluate whether newer ALK‐targeted drugs achieve this better than crizotinib.  
Study characteristics 
We searched the main medical databases and records of conferences up to 7 January 2021. We found 11 studies (2874 participants): six studies compared an ALK‐targeted drug to chemotherapy, and five studies compared a newer ALK‐targeted drug to crizotinib. The studies were conducted in people with advanced ALK‐mutated NSCLC using these drugs as their first or later treatment. A total of five different ALK inhibitors were used across studies: alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, crizotinib, and lorlatinib. 
Results 
People treated with ALK‐targeted drugs lived longer without their cancer growing than those on chemotherapy. These improvements were also seen in people with cancer that had spread to the brain. People receiving ALK‐targeted drugs lived longer overall, even when some had received chemotherapy first. ALK‐targeted drugs cause a similar number of side effects as chemotherapy. ALK‐targeted drugs caused more tumours to reduce in size and resulted in a longer time until worsening of symptoms when compared to chemotherapy.  
People treated with newer ALK‐targeted drugs lived longer without their cancer growing than those receiving crizotinib, including in people with cancer involving the brain. People treated with newer ALK‐targeted drugs as first treatment were likely to live longer overall with a similar number of overall side effects. Newer ALK‐targeted drugs caused more tumours to reduce in size when compared to crizotinib. 
The evidence for most reported measures was of moderate or high certainty.
Conclusions 
The best first treatment for people with incurable ALK‐mutated lung cancer is a newer ALK inhibitor such as alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, or lorlatinib. More studies are needed to determine which of these options is best and what treatment should be used when the cancer grows after these medicines have been given.

10.1002-14651858.CD009359.pub2,"Racecadotril to treat children under five years of age with acute diarrhoea
What was the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether racecadotril works for children under five years of age with diarrhoea. Cochrane Review authors collected and analysed all relevant trials to answer this question and included seven trials in this review. 
Key messages 
Racecadotril may reduce the risk of rehydration failure. We are uncertain whether or not it influences number of bowel movements or duration of diarrhoea. 
What was studied in the review? 
Diarrhoea is a leading cause of death in children under five years old, especially in low‐income countries. Children who have diarrhoea often suffer from frequent and watery bowel movements, which might cause excessive loss of fluid and electrolytes (dehydration). Fluid replacement is recommended to prevent and treat dehydration caused by diarrhoea. Racecadotril has been used in addition to fluid replacement for treating diarrhoea in children, as it reduces release of water and electrolytes into the digestive tract. The drug is supposed to improve the symptoms of diarrhoea (shorten duration of diarrhoea or reduce the stool frequency) as well as reduce the risk of rehydration failure. However, it is not clear if racecadotril really works for children with diarrhoea. 
What are the main results? 
The review authors searched for available trials and included seven trials. The trials were conducted in a total of 1140 children aged from 3 months to 5 years. Children who were given racecadotril were compared to a control group (children who, instead of racecadotril, received a placebo (a dummy drug that contains no racecadotril) or no drug). The review shows that when children with diarrhoea were given racecadotril, compared to placebo or no drug: 
• racecadotril may reduce the risk of rehydration failure (low‐certainty evidence); • we are uncertain whether or not racecadotril shortens duration of diarrhoea (very low‐certainty evidence); • we are uncertain whether racecadotril influences the number of stools (very low‐certainty evidence); • racecadotril may reduce weight of stool output (low‐certainty evidence); • racecadotril may make little or no difference to length of hospital stay for inpatients (low‐certainty evidence); • racecadotril may make little or no difference to rates of side‐effect events (low‐certainty evidence) 
How up to date is this review? 
The review authors searched for trials published up to 4 March 2019.

Does a Drug Called Racecadotril Help Young Children with Diarrhea?

### **Rationale**
Diarrhea can be very serious for children under five years old. It causes them to have many watery poops. This can make them lose too much water and important body salts. When the body loses too much water, it is called being ""dried out,"" or dehydration. This is a big problem, especially in countries with less money.

The main way to help a child with diarrhea is to give them lots of fluids to drink. This replaces the water and salts they have lost. Doctors also sometimes use a drug called racecadotril. This drug is meant to help by stopping the gut from releasing so much water. The hope is that the drug will make the diarrhea end sooner.

However, we were not sure if racecadotril really works for young children. Researchers wanted to look at all the past studies on this drug. They wanted to find a clear answer about whether it helps children with diarrhea get better.

### **Trial Design**
This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers did a review. They searched for and combined all the best studies that had already been done. This helps give a stronger and more reliable answer.

The researchers found seven good studies to review. These studies included a total of 1,140 children. The children were between 3 months and 5 years old. All of them had diarrhea.

In each of the old studies, the children were put into groups. One group of children was given the real drug, racecadotril. Another group was given a placebo, which is a fake pill with no medicine in it, or they were given no drug at all. All of the children in all of the groups were still given fluids to drink. This is the normal and most important care for diarrhea.

### **Results**
The review found that we are still not sure if racecadotril is a helpful drug for young children with diarrhea. The evidence from the studies was not very strong.

Here is what the researchers found:
*   **Staying hydrated:** The drug might help keep children from getting too dried out. But the researchers were not very sure about this result.
*   **How long diarrhea lasts:** The researchers were very unsure if the drug helps the diarrhea go away any faster.
*   **Number of poops:** The researchers were also very unsure if the drug helps children have fewer watery poops each day.
*   **Amount of poop:** The drug might help reduce the total weight of the watery poop. But again, the researchers were not very sure about this.
*   **Staying in the hospital:** For children who were in the hospital, the drug did not seem to help them get home any sooner.
*   **Safety:** The drug appeared to be safe. Children who took racecadotril did not have more bad side effects than the children who took the fake pill.

In the end, the researchers concluded that racecadotril might help prevent children from getting too dried out. However, we cannot be sure if it helps with other symptoms of diarrhea. More and better studies are needed to know for sure if this drug should be given to young children.","Racecadotril to treat children under five years of age with acute diarrhoea

10.1002-14651858.CD013787,"Background
Specific diagnostic tests to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and resulting COVID‐19 disease are not always available and take time to obtain results. Routine laboratory markers such as white blood cell count, measures of anticoagulation, C‐reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin, are used to assess the clinical status of a patient. These laboratory tests may be useful for the triage of people with potential COVID‐19 to prioritize them for different levels of treatment, especially in situations where time and resources are limited. 
Objectives
To assess the diagnostic accuracy of routine laboratory testing as a triage test to determine if a person has COVID‐19. 
Search methods
On 4 May 2020 we undertook electronic searches in the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and the COVID‐19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, which is updated daily with published articles from PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID‐19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included both case‐control designs and consecutive series of patients that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of routine laboratory testing as a triage test to determine if a person has COVID‐19. The reference standard could be reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) alone; RT‐PCR plus clinical expertise or and imaging; repeated RT‐PCR several days apart or from different samples; WHO and other case definitions; and any other reference standard used by the study authors. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data from each included study. They also assessed the methodological quality of the studies, using QUADAS‐2. We used the 'NLMIXED' procedure in SAS 9.4 for the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) meta‐analyses of tests for which we included four or more studies. To facilitate interpretation of results, for each meta‐analysis we estimated summary sensitivity at the points on the SROC curve that corresponded to the median and interquartile range boundaries of specificities in the included studies. 
Main results
We included 21 studies in this review, including 14,126 COVID‐19 patients and 56,585 non‐COVID‐19 patients in total. Studies evaluated a total of 67 different laboratory tests. Although we were interested in the diagnotic accuracy of routine tests for COVID‐19, the included studies used detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection through RT‐PCR as reference standard. There was considerable heterogeneity between tests, threshold values and the settings in which they were applied. For some tests a positive result was defined as a decrease compared to normal vaues, for other tests a positive result was defined as an increase, and for some tests both increase and decrease may have indicated test positivity. None of the studies had either low risk of bias on all domains or low concerns for applicability for all domains. Only three of the tests evaluated had a summary sensitivity and specificity over 50%. These were: increase in interleukin‐6, increase in C‐reactive protein and lymphocyte count decrease. 
Blood count 
Eleven studies evaluated a decrease in white blood cell count, with a median specificity of 93% and a summary sensitivity of 25% (95% CI 8.0% to 27%; very low‐certainty evidence). The 15 studies that evaluated an increase in white blood cell count had a lower median specificity and a lower corresponding sensitivity. Four studies evaluated a decrease in neutrophil count. Their median specificity was 93%, corresponding to a summary sensitivity of 10% (95% CI 1.0% to 56%; low‐certainty evidence). The 11 studies that evaluated an increase in neutrophil count had a lower median specificity and a lower corresponding sensitivity. The summary sensitivity of an increase in neutrophil percentage (4 studies) was 59% (95% CI 1.0% to 100%) at median specificity (38%; very low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in monocyte count (4 studies) was 13% (95% CI 6.0% to 26%) at median specificity (73%; very low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of a decrease in lymphocyte count (13 studies) was 64% (95% CI 28% to 89%) at median specificity (53%; low‐certainty evidence). Four studies that evaluated a decrease in lymphocyte percentage showed a lower median specificity and lower corresponding sensitivity. The summary sensitivity of a decrease in platelets (4 studies) was 19% (95% CI 10% to 32%) at median specificity (88%; low‐certainty evidence). 
Liver function tests 
The summary sensitivity of an increase in alanine aminotransferase (9 studies) was 12% (95% CI 3% to 34%) at median specificity (92%; low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in aspartate aminotransferase (7 studies) was 29% (95% CI 17% to 45%) at median specificity (81%) (low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of a decrease in albumin (4 studies) was 21% (95% CI 3% to 67%) at median specificity (66%; low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in total bilirubin (4 studies) was 12% (95% CI 3.0% to 34%) at median specificity (92%; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Markers of inflammation 
The summary sensitivity of an increase in CRP (14 studies) was 66% (95% CI 55% to 75%) at median specificity (44%; very low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in procalcitonin (6 studies) was 3% (95% CI 1% to 19%) at median specificity (86%; very low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in IL‐6 (four studies) was 73% (95% CI 36% to 93%) at median specificity (58%) (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Other biomarkers 
The summary sensitivity of an increase in creatine kinase (5 studies) was 11% (95% CI 6% to 19%) at median specificity (94%) (low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in serum creatinine (four studies) was 7% (95% CI 1% to 37%) at median specificity (91%; low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in lactate dehydrogenase (4 studies) was 25% (95% CI 15% to 38%) at median specificity (72%; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Although these tests give an indication about the general health status of patients and some tests may be specific indicators for inflammatory processes, none of the tests we investigated are useful for accurately ruling in or ruling out COVID‐19 on their own. Studies were done in specific hospitalized populations, and future studies should consider non‐hospital settings to evaluate how these tests would perform in people with milder symptoms.

Can Common Blood Tests Help Find COVID-19?

**Rationale**

COVID-19 is a sickness caused by a virus. To know for sure if a person has COVID-19, they need a special test. But these tests can be slow to give results. Sometimes, they are hard to get.

Doctors often use simple blood tests to check a person’s general health. These tests are fast and are done all the time in hospitals. Researchers in this study wanted to know if these common blood tests could help find COVID-19.

Using these simple tests could help doctors quickly sort patients who might have the virus. This is very important when hospitals are busy and many people are sick. The main question was: Can common blood tests help tell who has COVID-19 and who does not?

**Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, the doctors looked at studies that were already finished. This is called a review. A review helps get a stronger answer by looking at a lot of information at once.

The doctors looked for studies that used common blood tests on people who might have COVID-19. They found 21 studies to include in their review. In total, these studies had information from over 70,000 people. About 14,000 of these people had COVID-19. The other people did not have COVID-19.

The doctors looked at the results from all these past studies. They put the results together to see how well different blood tests worked to find COVID-19.

**Results**

The doctors looked at the results of 67 different common blood tests. They found that no single blood test was good enough to accurately find COVID-19 on its own. The tests also could not be used to be sure that someone did not have COVID-19.

To see how well a test works, doctors look at two things:
*   How well it finds people who **do** have the sickness.
*   How well it finds people who **do not** have the sickness.

Most of the blood tests were not good at finding people who had COVID-19. Only three tests did a little better than the others. These tests look for signs of swelling in the body, which is called inflammation.

One of these tests was for a substance called C-reactive protein, or CRP.
*   When CRP levels were high, the test correctly found about 2 out of 3 people who had COVID-19.
*   But this test also gave wrong results for many people who did not have the virus.

Another test looked at a type of white blood cell called a lymphocyte.
*   When the number of these cells was low, the test correctly found about 2 out of 3 people who had COVID-19.
*   But this test also made mistakes and was not reliable on its own.

The doctors who did this review concluded that common blood tests can show if a person is generally sick or has inflammation. But these tests cannot tell if the sickness is COVID-19. More studies are needed to see if these tests could be helpful for people with milder sickness outside of a hospital.","How accurate are routine laboratory tests for diagnosis of COVID‐19?
What are routine laboratory tests? 
Routine laboratory tests are blood tests that assess the health status of a patient. Tests include counts of different types of white blood cells (these help the body fight infection), and detection of markers (proteins) that indicate organ damage, and general inflammation. These tests are widely available and in some places they may be the only tests available for diagnosis of COVID‐19. 
What did we want to find out? 
People with suspected COVID‐19 need to know quickly whether they are infected so that they can self‐isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. 
Currently, the standard test for COVID‐19 is usually the RT‐PCR test. In the RT‐PCR, samples from the nose and throat are sent away for testing, usually to a large, central laboratory with specialist equipment. Other tests include imaging tests, like X‐rays, which also require specialist equipment. 
We wanted to know whether routine laboratory tests were sufficiently accurate to diagnose COVID‐19 in people with suspected COVID‐19. We also wanted to know whether they were accurate enough to prioritize patients for different levels of treatment. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed the accuracy of routine laboratory tests to diagnose COVID‐19 compared with RT‐PCR or other tests. Studies could be of any design and be set anywhere in the world. Studies could include participants of any age or sex, with suspected COVID‐19, or use samples from people known to have – or not to have ‐ COVID‐19. 
What we found 
We found 21 studies that looked at 67 different routine laboratory tests for COVID‐19. Most of the studies looked at how accurately these tests diagnosed infection with the virus causing COVID‐19. Four studies included both children and adults, 16 included only adults and one study only children. Seventeen studies were done in China, and one each in Iran, Italy, Taiwan and the USA. All studies took place in hospitals, except one that used samples from a database. Most studies used RT‐PCR to confirm COVID‐19 diagnosis. 
Accuracy of tests is most often reported using ‘sensitivity’ and ‘specificity’. Sensitivity is the proportion of people with COVID‐19 correctly detected by the test; specificity is the proportion of people without COVID‐19 who are correctly identified by the test. The nearer sensitivity and specificity are to 100%, the better the test. A test to prioritize people for treatment would require a high sensitivity of more than 80%. 
Where four or more studies evaluated a particular test, we pooled their results and analyzed them together. Our analyses showed that only three of the tests had both sensitivity and specificity over 50%. Two of these were markers for general inflammation (increases in interleukin‐6 and C‐reactive protein). The third was for lymphocyte count decrease. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell where a low count might indicate infection. 
How reliable are the results? 
Our confidence in the evidence from this review is low because the studies were different from each other, which made them difficult to compare. For example, some included very sick people, while some included people with hardly any COVID‐19 symptoms. Also, the diagnosis of COVID‐19 was confirmed in different ways: RT‐PCR was sometimes used in combination with other tests. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Routine laboratory tests can be issued by most healthcare facilities. However, our results are probably not representative of most clinical situations in which these tests are being used. Most studies included very sick people with high rates of COVID‐19 virus infection of between 27% and 76%. In most primary healthcare facilities, this percentage will be lower. 
What does this mean? 
Routine laboratory tests cannot distinguish between COVID‐19 and other diseases as the cause of infection, inflammation or tissue damage. None of the tests performed well enough to be a standalone diagnostic test for COVID‐19 nor to prioritize patients for treatment. They will mainly be used to provide an overall picture about the health status of the patient. The final COVID‐19 diagnosis has to be made based on other tests. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We searched all COVID‐19 studies up to 4 May 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD013348.pub2,"Background
Cervical cancer ranks as the fourth leading cause of death from cancer in women. Historically, women with metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer have had limited treatment options. New anti‐angiogenesis therapies, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeting agents, offer an alternative strategy to conventional chemotherapy; they act by inhibiting the growth of new blood vessels, thereby restricting tumour growth by blocking the blood supply. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of VEGF targeting agents in the management of persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer. 
Search methods
We performed searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, online registers of clinical trials, and abstracts of scientific meetings up until 27 May 2020. 
Selection criteria
We examined randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the use of VEGF targeting agents alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapy or other VEGF targeting agents. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently screened the results of search strategies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and analysed data according to the standard methods expected by Cochrane. The certainty of evidence was assessed via the GRADE approach. 
Main results
A total of 1634 records were identified. From these, we identified four studies with a total of 808 participants for inclusion. We also identified two studies that were awaiting classification and nine ongoing studies. 
Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy 
Treatment with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy may result in lower risk of death compared to chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.95; 1 study, 452 participants; low‐certainty evidence). However, there are probably more specific adverse events when compared to chemotherapy alone, including gastrointestinal perforations or fistulae (risk ratio (RR) 18.00, 95% CI 2.42 to 133.67; 1 study, 440 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); serious thromboembolic events (RR 4.5, 95% CI 1.55 to 13.08; 1 study, 440 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); and hypertension (RR 13.75, 95% CI 5.07 to 37.29; 1 study, 440 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There may also be a higher incidence of serious haemorrhage (RR 5.00, 95% CI 1.11 to 22.56; 1 study, 440 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In addition, the incidence of serious adverse events is probably higher (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.79; 1 study, 439 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio was USD 295,164 per quality‐adjusted life‐year (1 study, 452 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Cediranib plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy 
Treatment with cediranib plus chemotherapy may or may not result in similar risk of death when compared to chemotherapy alone (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.65; 1 study, 69 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We found very uncertain results for the incidences of specific adverse events, including gastrointestinal perforations or fistulae (RR 3.27, 95% CI 0.14 to 77.57; 1 study, 67 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); serious haemorrhage (RR 5.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 109.49; 1 study, 67 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); serious thromboembolic events (RR 3.41, 95% CI 0.14 to 80.59; 1 study, 60 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); and serious hypertension (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.02 to 8.62; 1 study, 67 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In addition, there may or may not be a similar incidence of serious adverse events compared to chemotherapy alone (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.78; 1 study, 67 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Apatinib plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy/brachytherapy versus chemotherapy or chemotherapy/brachytherapy 
Treatment with apatinib plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy/brachytherapy may or may not result in similar risk of death compared to chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy/brachytherapy alone (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.60; 1 study, 52 participants; low‐certainty evidence). However, hypertension events may occur at a higher incidence as compared to chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy/brachytherapy alone (RR 5.14, 95% CI 1.28 to 20.73; 1 study, 52 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Pazopanib plus lapatinib versus lapatinib 
Treatment with pazopanib plus lapatinib may result in higher risk of death compared to lapatinib alone (HR 2.71, 95% CI 1.16 to 6.31; 1 study, 117 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We found very uncertain results for the incidences of specific adverse events, including gastrointestinal perforations or fistulae (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.59; 1 study, 152 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); haemorrhage (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.72 to 5.58; 1 study, 152 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); and thromboembolic events (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.50; 1 study, 152 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In addition, the incidence of hypertension events is probably higher (RR 12.00, 95% CI 2.94 to 49.01; 1 study, 152 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There may or may not be a similar incidence of serious adverse events as compared to lapatinib alone (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.26; 1 study, 152 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Pazopanib versus lapatinib 
Treatment with pazopanib may or may not result in similar risk of death as compared to lapatinib (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.38; 1 study, 152 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We found very uncertain results for the incidences of specific adverse events, including gastrointestinal perforations or fistulae (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.12; 1 study, 150 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); haemorrhage (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.31 to 3.40; 1 study, 150 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); and thromboembolic events (RR 3.08, 95% CI 0.13 to 74.42; 1 study, 150 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In addition, the incidence of hypertension events is probably higher (RR 11.81, 95% CI 2.89 to 48.33; 1 study, 150 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The risk of serious adverse events may or may not be similar as compared to lapatinib (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.07; 1 study, 150 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
We found low‐certainty evidence in favour of the use of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy. However, bevacizumab probably increases specific adverse events (gastrointestinal perforations or fistulae, thromboembolic events, hypertension) and serious adverse events. We found low‐certainty evidence that does not support the use of cediranib plus chemotherapy, apatinib plus chemotherapy, apatinib plus chemotherapy/brachytherapy, or pazopanib monotherapy. We found low‐certainty evidence suggesting that pazopanib plus lapatinib worsens outcomes. The VEGF inhibitors apatinib and pazopanib may increase the probability of hypertension events.

Looking at New Drugs for Cervical Cancer That Has Spread or Come Back

### **Rationale**

Cervical cancer is a serious illness for women. It is one of the main causes of death from cancer in women around the world.

When cervical cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it is called metastatic. When it comes back after treatment, it is called recurrent. It can be hard to treat cancer that has spread or come back. The usual cancer drugs, called chemotherapy, may not work well for long.

Doctors are looking for new ways to treat this cancer. One new idea is to stop the cancer from growing. Cancers need to grow their own blood vessels to get food and oxygen. A new type of drug tries to stop this. These drugs block the signals that tell blood vessels to grow. This can help starve the cancer and stop it from getting bigger.

This study looked at these new drugs. Researchers wanted to know if these drugs could help women with advanced cervical cancer. They also wanted to know if the drugs were safe to use.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at studies that were already finished. This is called a review. It helps bring all the information together in one place.

The researchers looked for the best type of study. These are called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, people are put into groups by chance. One group gets the new drug, and the other group gets the standard drug or a different treatment. This helps to fairly compare the treatments.

The researchers found 4 studies that met their standards. In total, these studies included 808 women. All the women had cervical cancer that had spread or had come back after treatment. The studies compared the new drugs to standard cancer drugs.

### **Results**

The researchers looked at the results for a few different drugs. Here is what they found for each one.

**Bevacizumab (a new drug) with standard cancer drugs**
One study looked at adding the new drug bevacizumab to standard cancer drugs. The results showed that women who got bevacizumab plus the standard drugs may have lived longer.

But this mix of drugs also had more side effects. Women taking bevacizumab had a much higher chance of serious problems. These problems included holes or tears in their stomach or gut. They also had a higher chance of serious blood clots and high blood pressure. The risk of serious bleeding was also higher.

The researchers said they were not very sure that this drug helps women live longer. But they were more sure that it causes these serious side effects.

**Cediranib (a new drug) with standard cancer drugs**
Another study looked at a drug called cediranib. The researchers were not sure if adding this drug to standard cancer drugs helped women live longer. They were also very unsure about its side effects. The information from this study was not strong enough to make a decision.

**Apatinib (a new drug) with standard cancer drugs**
A different study looked at the drug apatinib. The researchers were not sure if this drug helped women live longer. Women who took this drug did have a higher chance of getting high blood pressure.

**Pazopanib (a new drug) with another drug**
One study looked at two new drugs together: pazopanib and lapatinib. The results suggested this mix of drugs may be harmful. Women who took both drugs seemed to have a higher risk of dying than women who only took lapatinib.

This drug mix also had a much higher chance of causing high blood pressure. The researchers were not sure about other side effects because the evidence was not clear.

**Pazopanib (a new drug) by itself**
The same study also looked at pazopanib by itself. When compared to the drug lapatinib, researchers were not sure if pazopanib helped women live longer. Pazopanib did cause a much higher chance of high blood pressure.

**What the Researchers Concluded**
Based on all the studies, the researchers came to a few main points.

The drug bevacizumab may help women live longer when added to standard cancer drugs. But it also likely causes serious side effects. These include holes in the gut, blood clots, and high blood pressure.

The other new drugs studied did not seem to help women live longer. This includes cediranib and apatinib. The mix of pazopanib and lapatinib may even be harmful. The new drugs apatinib and pazopanib seem to cause high blood pressure.

The researchers said that more studies are needed. The evidence for some of these drugs was not very strong. This makes it hard to be sure about the benefits and harms.","Inhibition of blood vessel formation in advanced cervical cancer
What is the aim of this review?The aim of this Cochrane Review is to find out whether vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeting drugs, which inhibit the formation of new blood vessels, can improve survival in women with cervical cancer that has spread to distant sites (metastasised) or has not responded to or come back (recurred) after initial treatment. These drugs include bevacizumab, cediranib, apatinib, pazopanib, anlotinib, and nintedanib. 
Key messagesBevacizumab plus chemotherapy may improve survival and probably increases specific and serious adverse events, including gastrointestinal perforations through the gut wall, blood clot formation (thromboembolic events) in blood vessels, hypertension (increased blood pressure), and bleeding (haemorrhage). 
Cediranib or apatinib plus chemotherapy, or pazopanib alone, may make little to no difference in survival. Pazopanib plus lapatinib may reduce survival. 
What are the main results of the review?We found four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that met our inclusion criteria and enrolled 808 women. 
We found one study, which included 452 women, that assessed the use of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. The inclusion of bevacizumab may improve overall survival and probably increases the incidences of specific and serious adverse events. 
A second study analysed 69 women treated with cediranib plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. Cediranib may make little to no difference in survival, and it is uncertain whether it increases the incidences of specific or serious adverse events. 
Another study with 59 women reported data on the use of apatinib plus chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy) versus chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy alone. Apatinib may make little to no difference in survival, but it exhibited promising efficacy for progression‐free survival. 
We found one study with 228 women that compared pazopanib plus lapatinib versus only lapatinib, or pazopanib versus lapatinib: pazopanib plus lapatinib may reduce survival and probably increases the incidence of hypertension; pazopanib alone may make little to no difference in survival and probably increases the incidence of hypertension. 
Overall the quality (certainty) of the evidence was low, as each comparison included only one study and most studies were small.

10.1002-14651858.MR000013.pub6,"Background
Recruiting participants to trials can be extremely difficult. Identifying strategies that improve trial recruitment would benefit both trialists and health research. 
Objectives
To quantify the effects of strategies for improving recruitment of participants to randomised trials. A secondary objective is to assess the evidence for the effect of the research setting (e.g. primary care versus secondary care) on recruitment. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Methodology Review Group Specialised Register (CMR) in the Cochrane Library (July 2012, searched 11 February 2015); MEDLINE and MEDLINE In Process (OVID) (1946 to 10 February 2015); Embase (OVID) (1996 to 2015 Week 06); Science Citation Index & Social Science Citation Index (ISI) (2009 to 11 February 2015) and ERIC (EBSCO) (2009 to 11 February 2015). 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials of methods to increase recruitment to randomised trials. This includes non‐healthcare studies and studies recruiting to hypothetical trials. We excluded studies aiming to increase response rates to questionnaires or trial retention and those evaluating incentives and disincentives for clinicians to recruit participants. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data on: the method evaluated; country in which the study was carried out; nature of the population; nature of the study setting; nature of the study to be recruited into; randomisation or quasi‐randomisation method; and numbers and proportions in each intervention group. We used a risk difference to estimate the absolute improvement and the 95% confidence interval (CI) to describe the effect in individual trials. We assessed heterogeneity between trial results. We used GRADE to judge the certainty we had in the evidence coming from each comparison. 
Main results
We identified 68 eligible trials (24 new to this update) with more than 74,000 participants. There were 63 studies involving interventions aimed directly at trial participants, while five evaluated interventions aimed at people recruiting participants. All studies were in health care. 
We found 72 comparisons, but just three are supported by high‐certainty evidence according to GRADE. 
1. Open trials rather than blinded, placebo trials. The absolute improvement was 10% (95% CI 7% to 13%). 
2. Telephone reminders to people who do not respond to a postal invitation. The absolute improvement was 6% (95% CI 3% to 9%). This result applies to trials that have low underlying recruitment. We are less certain for trials that start out with moderately good recruitment (i.e. over 10%). 
3. Using a particular, bespoke, user‐testing approach to develop participant information leaflets. This method involved spending a lot of time working with the target population for recruitment to decide on the content, format and appearance of the participant information leaflet. This made little or no difference to recruitment: absolute improvement was 1% (95% CI −1% to 3%). 
We had moderate‐certainty evidence for eight other comparisons; our confidence was reduced for most of these because the results came from a single study. Three of the methods were changes to trial management, three were changes to how potential participants received information, one was aimed at recruiters, and the last was a test of financial incentives. All of these comparisons would benefit from other researchers replicating the evaluation. There were no evaluations in paediatric trials. 
We had much less confidence in the other 61 comparisons because the studies had design flaws, were single studies, had very uncertain results or were hypothetical (mock) trials rather than real ones. 
Authors' conclusions
The literature on interventions to improve recruitment to trials has plenty of variety but little depth. Only 3 of 72 comparisons are supported by high‐certainty evidence according to GRADE: having an open trial and using telephone reminders to non‐responders to postal interventions both increase recruitment; a specialised way of developing participant information leaflets had little or no effect. The methodology research community should improve the evidence base by replicating evaluations of existing strategies, rather than developing and testing new ones.

Finding Better Ways to Ask People to Join Health Studies

**Rationale**

Health studies, also called clinical trials, are very important. They help us find new ways to treat diseases. But it can be very hard to find enough people who are willing to join these studies. If a study does not have enough people, it can be hard for doctors to learn if a new medicine works. This can slow down the search for new treatments.

Researchers wanted to solve this problem. They looked at all the different ways that have been used to invite people to join a health study. Their goal was to see which ways worked best to get more people to sign up. This work is needed to help future studies find people more easily. This can help us get answers about new treatments faster.

**Trial Design**

This was a special type of study. The researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they did a ""study of studies."" They searched for and collected all the studies that had already tested different ways to invite people to join a trial.

The researchers found 68 different studies to look at. In total, these studies included more than 74,000 people. The people in these studies were all being asked to join a health study for a real health problem. The researchers carefully looked at the results from all 68 studies. They put the results together to find out what works best.

**Results**

The researchers found a few methods that helped get more people to join studies. There was strong proof for three key findings.

First, the type of study matters. Some studies are ""open."" This means everyone knows what medicine they are getting. Other studies are ""blinded."" This means you might get the real medicine or a fake one, like a sugar pill. People do not know which one they get. More people joined open studies. For every 100 people asked, about 10 more joined a study when it was open.

Second, phone calls can help. Some studies mail out invitations. The researchers found that calling people who did not reply to the letter helped a lot. For every 100 people who were invited by mail, about 6 more joined if they got a follow-up phone call. This worked best for studies that were having a hard time finding people.

Third, the information sheets given to patients were studied. Some researchers tried a special way to create these sheets. They worked closely with patients to decide what to write and how it should look. But this special method did not help much. It made little to no difference in how many people joined.

The researchers found some other ideas that might work, but the proof was not as strong. They concluded that we only have strong proof for a few ways to get more people to join studies. They believe we should do more research on the methods we already know about. This will help us be sure they work well before we try to invent new ones.","What improves trial recruitment?
Key messages 
We had high‐certainty evidence for three methods to improve recruitment, two of which are effective: 
1. Telling people what they are receiving in the trial rather than not telling them improves recruitment. 
2. Phoning people who do not respond to a postal invitation is also effective (although we are not certain this works as well in all trials). 
3. Using a tailored, user‐testing approach to develop participant information leaflets makes little or no difference to recruitment. 
Of the 72 strategies tested, only 7 involved more than one study. We need more studies to understand whether they work or not. 
Our question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of things trial teams do to try and improve recruitment to their trials. We found 68 studies involving more than 74,000 people. 
Background 
Finding participants for trials can be difficult, and trial teams try many things to improve recruitment. It is important to know whether these actually work. Our review looked for studies that examined this question using chance to allocate people to different recruitment strategies because this is the fairest way of seeing if one approach is better than another. 
Key results 
We found 68 studies including 72 comparisons. We have high certainty in what we found for only three of these. 
1. Telling people what they are receiving in the trial rather than not telling them improves recruitment. Our best estimate is that if 100 people were told what they were receiving in a randomised trial, and 100 people were not, 10 more would take part n the group who knew. There is some uncertainty though: it could be as few as 7 more per hundred, or as many as 13 more. 
2. Phoning people who do not respond to a postal invitation to take part is also effective. Our best estimate is that if investigators called 100 people who did not respond to a postal invitation, and did not call 100 others, 6 more would take part in the trial among the group who received a call. However, this number could be as few as 3 more per hundred, or as many as 9 more. 
3. Using a tailored, user‐testing approach to develop participant information leaflets did not make much difference. The researchers who tested this method spent a lot of time working with people like those to be recruited to decide what should be in the participant information leaflet and what it should look like. Our best estimate is that if 100 people got the new leaflet, 1 more would take part in the trial compared to 100 who got the old leaflet. However, there is some uncertainty, and it could be 1 fewer (i.e. worse than the old leaflet) per hundred, or as many as 3 more. 
We had moderate certainty in what we found for eight other comparisons; our confidence was reduced for most of these because the method had been tested in only one study. We had much less confidence in the other 61 comparisons because the studies had design flaws, were the only studies to look at a particular method, had a very uncertain result or were mock trials rather than real ones. 
Study characteristics 
The 68 included studies covered a very wide range of disease areas, including antenatal care, cancer, home safety, hypertension, podiatry, smoking cessation and surgery. Primary, secondary and community care were included. The size of the studies ranged from 15 to 14,467 participants. Studies came from 12 countries; there was also one multinational study involving 19 countries. The USA and UK dominated with 25 and 22 studies, respectively. The next largest contribution came from Australia with eight studies. 
The small print 
Our search updated our 2010 review and is current to February 2015. We also identified six studies published after 2015 outside the search. The review includes 24 mock trials where the researchers asked people about whether they would take part in an imaginary trial. We have not presented or discussed their results because it is hard to see how the findings relate to real trial decisions.

10.1002-14651858.CD004474.pub2,"Tongxinluo (a traditional Chinese medicine) capsules may help patients suffering from unstable angina 
Tongxinluo, in capsule form, is a traditional Chinese medicine which consists of herbs and insects. Traditionally it has been thought to have clinical benefits for patients with angina, including the reduction of the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and complications of some types of heart surgery. Some studies also suggest a possible benefit in reducing the frequency and severity of angina attacks and improving symptoms. However, none of these individual studies have been reviewed systematically. 
The review authors systematically reviewed evidence from 18 randomised controlled trials for the benefit of tongxinluo with or without other treatments, including routine care or placebo, for patients with unstable angina. All the trials were conducted in China. The total number of participants was 1413, ranging in age from 25 to 88 years. Most studies randomised patients to receive tongxinluo with conventional medication or conventional medications alone. 
There was some evidence from seven studies that tongxinluo improved the electrocardiogram (ECG) changes indicating ischaemia and reduced the number of people with no improvement or worsening of ECG (six studies). Some improvement in angina symptoms (10 studies) and reduced numbers of people showing no improvement or worsening of symptoms were apparent with tongxinluo. Tongxinluo appeared to be as effective as isosorbide mononitrate in three studies. A few cases of slight gastrointestinal discomfort were reported after giving tongxinluo in seven studies and three cases of breaking of tiny blood vessels under the skin (ecchymosis) in one study. 
The evidence suggested possible benefits relating to a range of outcomes among patients with unstable angina but all the studies were of poor quality and neither blinding nor allocation concealment were used. This makes it impossible to reach firm conclusions about the benefit of this treatment. Large, high quality, randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the possible benefit of tongxinluo for unstable angina and to suggest appropriate future use of this herbal medicine.

Does a Chinese medicine called Tongxinluo help with serious chest pain?

### **Rationale**

**What is unstable angina?**

Unstable angina is a type of serious chest pain. It happens when the heart muscle does not get enough blood and oxygen. This is often caused by blocked blood vessels that go to the heart. This condition can be scary and painful for patients. It is a warning sign that a person is at high risk for a heart attack.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

A traditional Chinese medicine called Tongxinluo is sometimes used for heart problems. It comes in a capsule and is made from a mix of herbs and insects. Some doctors believe it can help patients with chest pain. A few small studies suggested that it might reduce how often people have chest pain attacks.

However, no one had gathered all the information from these small studies to see what it all meant together. Researchers wanted to review all the past studies. They hoped to find out if Tongxinluo is truly a safe and helpful treatment for people with unstable angina.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, the researchers looked at studies that were already done. This is called a review. The researchers found 18 different studies that tested Tongxinluo for unstable angina. All of these studies took place in China.

**Who was in the studies?**

The 18 studies included a total of 1,413 people. The people in the studies were men and women between 25 and 88 years old. All of them had been diagnosed with unstable angina.

In most of the studies, the people were split into two groups. One group took Tongxinluo along with their usual heart medicine. The other group took only their usual heart medicine. By comparing the two groups, the researchers could see if adding Tongxinluo made a difference.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The review found some signs that Tongxinluo might help people with unstable angina.

Researchers looked at the results of heart tests called ECGs. An ECG checks the electrical signals of the heart and can show if the heart is getting enough blood. In 7 of the studies, people who took Tongxinluo had better ECG results. They also seemed to have fewer symptoms of chest pain.

In 3 of the studies, Tongxinluo appeared to work just as well as a common heart drug called isosorbide mononitrate. The medicine also seemed mostly safe. The main side effects were mild stomach upset. In one study, 3 people had small bruises form under their skin.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

Although some results looked good, the researchers found a very big problem. All 18 of the studies they reviewed were of poor quality. A good quality study must be done in a very careful way to make sure the results are fair and true. For example, patients should not know if they are getting the real medicine or a fake pill (a placebo). This was not done in the studies.

Because the studies were not done well, we cannot be sure if Tongxinluo really works. The results might look good, but we cannot trust them. The researchers concluded that we need new, large, and high-quality studies. These better studies are needed to find out for sure if Tongxinluo is a good treatment for unstable angina.","Tongxinluo (a traditional Chinese medicine) capsules may help patients suffering from unstable angina

10.1002-14651858.CD013192,"Background
Melanoma accounts for a small proportion of all skin cancer cases but is responsible for most skin cancer‐related deaths. Early detection and treatment can improve survival. Smartphone applications are readily accessible and potentially offer an instant risk assessment of the likelihood of malignancy so that the right people seek further medical attention from a clinician for more detailed assessment of the lesion. There is, however, a risk that melanomas will be missed and treatment delayed if the application reassures the user that their lesion is low risk. 
Objectives
To assess the diagnostic accuracy of smartphone applications to rule out cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants in adults with concerns about suspicious skin lesions. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Studies of any design evaluating smartphone applications intended for use by individuals in a community setting who have lesions that might be suspicious for melanoma or atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants versus a reference standard of histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up and expert opinion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). Due to scarcity of data and poor quality of studies, we did not perform a meta‐analysis for this review. For illustrative purposes, we plotted estimates of sensitivity and specificity on coupled forest plots for each application under consideration. 
Main results
This review reports on two cohorts of lesions published in two studies. Both studies were at high risk of bias from selective participant recruitment and high rates of non‐evaluable images. Concerns about applicability of findings were high due to inclusion only of lesions already selected for excision in a dermatology clinic setting, and image acquisition by clinicians rather than by smartphone app users. 
We report data for five mobile phone applications and 332 suspicious skin lesions with 86 melanomas across the two studies. Across the four artificial intelligence‐based applications that classified lesion images (photographs) as melanomas (one application) or as high risk or 'problematic' lesions (three applications) using a pre‐programmed algorithm, sensitivities ranged from 7% (95% CI 2% to 16%) to 73% (95% CI 52% to 88%) and specificities from 37% (95% CI 29% to 46%) to 94% (95% CI 87% to 97%). The single application using store‐and‐forward review of lesion images by a dermatologist had a sensitivity of 98% (95% CI 90% to 100%) and specificity of 30% (95% CI 22% to 40%). 
The number of test failures (lesion images analysed by the applications but classed as 'unevaluable' and excluded by the study authors) ranged from 3 to 31 (or 2% to 18% of lesions analysed). The store‐and‐forward application had one of the highest rates of test failure (15%). At least one melanoma was classed as unevaluable in three of the four application evaluations. 
Authors' conclusions
Smartphone applications using artificial intelligence‐based analysis have not yet demonstrated sufficient promise in terms of accuracy, and they are associated with a high likelihood of missing melanomas. Applications based on store‐and‐forward images could have a potential role in the timely presentation of people with potentially malignant lesions by facilitating active self‐management health practices and early engagement of those with suspicious skin lesions; however, they may incur a significant increase in resource and workload. Given the paucity of evidence and low methodological quality of existing studies, it is not possible to draw any implications for practice. Nevertheless, this is a rapidly advancing field, and new and better applications with robust reporting of studies could change these conclusions substantially.

### **Plain Title**

Can Smartphone Apps Find Skin Cancer?

### **Rationale**

**What is melanoma?**

Melanoma is a serious type of skin cancer. It is not as common as other skin cancers. But it causes the most deaths from skin cancer. Finding and treating melanoma early is the best way to save lives.

**Why did we do this study?**

Many people have smartphones. There are apps that say they can check a spot on your skin. These apps try to tell you if the spot might be cancer. This could help people know when they need to see a real doctor.

But these apps could also be risky. What if an app tells you a spot is safe, but it is really a melanoma? You might wait too long to see a doctor. This delay could be very dangerous. We needed to know if these apps are good at finding skin cancer. This study looked at past research to see how well these apps work.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

The researchers did not test these apps on new people. Instead, they looked for all the past studies that had already tested these apps. They gathered all the results from those studies to see what they said. This is called a review.

The studies they looked at included adults who had skin spots that a doctor thought looked odd. In the original studies, all these spots were already planned to be removed and tested in a lab. The researchers in our study looked at the results for 332 skin spots. Of these, 86 were melanomas.

In the past studies, doctors took the pictures of the skin spots. It was not regular people using the apps on their own. This is an important detail. The results might be different if people took the pictures themselves.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The researchers looked at the results for five different smartphone apps from two studies. The apps worked in two different ways.

**Apps that use a computer to check pictures**

Four of the apps used a computer program to check the pictures. This is sometimes called artificial intelligence, or AI. The computer program decided if a spot was high risk or low risk.

These apps were not very good at finding melanomas.
*   One app missed more than 9 out of 10 skin cancers.
*   The best app in this group still missed about 3 out of 10 skin cancers.
This means these apps could falsely tell you that a dangerous spot is safe.

**Apps that send pictures to a doctor**

One app worked differently. You would take a picture of your skin spot. The app would then send it to a skin doctor to look at later.

This app was much better at finding melanomas. The doctor found almost all of the skin cancers from the pictures. However, this app had a different problem. The doctor often thought a safe spot might be cancer. This means many people would be told to see a doctor when they did not really need to. This could cause a lot of worry. It would also create more work for doctors' offices.

**Other problems with the apps**

For all the apps, some pictures could not be used. The app would say the picture was not clear enough to check. In some cases, the picture that could not be read was of a real melanoma.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

The researchers who did this review concluded that smartphone apps are not yet a safe way to check for skin cancer.
*   The apps that use a computer program miss too many melanomas. This is very risky.
*   The app that sends a picture to a doctor is better at finding cancer. But it causes many false alarms.

Right now, there is not enough good research to tell people to use these apps. The studies that have been done have problems. This makes it hard to trust the results. This is a new area of technology, and better apps may be made in the future. But for now, if you are worried about a spot on your skin, the safest thing to do is to see a doctor.","How accurate are smartphone applications ('apps') for detecting melanoma in adults?
What is the aim of the review? 
We wanted to find out how well smartphone applications can help the general public understand whether their skin lesions might be melanoma. 
Why is improving the diagnosis of malignant melanoma skin cancer important? 
Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer. Not recognising a melanoma (a false negative test result) could delay seeking appropriate advice and surgery to remove it. This increases the risk of the cancer spreading to other organs in the body and possibly causing death. Diagnosing a skin lesion as a melanoma when it is not present (a false positive result) may cause anxiety and lead to unnecessary surgery and further investigations. 
What was studied in the review? 
Specialised applications ('apps') that provide advice on skin lesions or moles that might cause people concern are widely available for smartphones. Some apps allow people to photograph any skin lesion they might be worried about and then receive guidance on whether to get medical advice. Apps may automatically classify lesions as high or low risk, while others can act as store‐and‐forward devices where images are sent to an experienced professional, such as a dermatologist, who then makes a risk assessment based on the photo. Cochrane researchers found two studies, evaluating five apps that used automated analysis of images and one that used a store‐and‐forward approach, to evaluate suspicious skin lesions. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review included two studies with 332 lesions, including 86 melanomas, analysed by at least one smartphone application. Both studies used photographs of moles or skin lesions that were about to be removed because doctors had already decided they could be melanomas. The photographs were taken by doctors instead of people taking pictures of their lesions with their own smartphones. For these reasons, we are not able to make a reliable estimate about how well the apps actually work. 
Four apps that produce an immediate (automated) assessment of a skin lesion or mole that has been photographed by the smartphone missed between 7 and 55 melanomas. 
One app that sends the photograph of a mole or skin lesion to a dermatologist for assessment missed only one melanoma. Another 6 melanomas examined by the dermatologist via the application were not classified as high risk; instead the dermatologist was not able to classify the lesion as either 'atypical' (possibly a melanoma) or 'typical' (definitely not a melanoma). 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
The small number and poor quality of included studies reduces the reliability of findings. The people included were not typical of those who would use the applications in real life. The final diagnosis of melanoma was made by histology, which is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether patients really had melanoma*. However, the studies excluded between 2% and 18% of images because the applications failed to produce a recommendation. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies took place in the USA and Germany. They did not report key patient information such as age and gender. The percentage of people with a final diagnosis of melanoma was 18% and 35%, much higher than that observed in community settings. The definition of eligible patients was narrow in comparison to likely users of the applications. The photographs used were taken by doctors rather than by smartphone users, which seriously impacts the applicability of results. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Current smartphone applications using automated analysis are observed to have a high chance of missing melanomas (false negatives). Store‐and‐forward image applications could have a potential role in the timely identification of people with potentially malignant lesions by facilitating early engagement of those with suspicious skin lesions, but they have resource and workload implications. 
The development of applications to help identify people who might have melanoma is a fast‐moving field. The emergence of new applications, higher quality and better reported studies could change the conclusions of this review substantially. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies biopsy was the reference standard (means of establishing final diagnoses).

Evidence from disease epidemics shows that healthcare workers are at risk of developing short‐ and long‐term mental health problems. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned about the potential negative impact of the COVID‐19 crisis on the mental well‐being of health and social care professionals. Symptoms of mental health problems commonly include depression, anxiety, stress, and additional cognitive and social problems; these can impact on function in the workplace. The mental health and resilience (ability to cope with the negative effects of stress) of frontline health and social care professionals ('frontline workers' in this review) could be supported during disease epidemics by workplace interventions, interventions to support basic daily needs, psychological support interventions, pharmacological interventions, or a combination of any or all of these. 
Objectives
Objective 1: to assess the effects of interventions aimed at supporting the resilience and mental health of frontline health and social care professionals during and after a disease outbreak, epidemic or pandemic. 
Objective 2: to identify barriers and facilitators that may impact on the implementation of interventions aimed at supporting the resilience and mental health of frontline health and social care professionals during and after a disease outbreak, epidemic or pandemic. 
Search methods
On 28 May 2020 we searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Global Index Medicus databases and WHO Institutional Repository for Information Sharing. We also searched ongoing trials registers and Google Scholar. We ran all searches from the year 2002 onwards, with no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included studies in which participants were health and social care professionals working at the front line during infectious disease outbreaks, categorised as epidemics or pandemics by WHO, from 2002 onwards. For objective 1 we included quantitative evidence from randomised trials, non‐randomised trials, controlled before‐after studies and interrupted time series studies, which investigated the effect of any intervention to support mental health or resilience, compared to no intervention, standard care, placebo or attention control intervention, or other active interventions. For objective 2 we included qualitative evidence from studies that described barriers and facilitators to the implementation of interventions. Outcomes critical to this review were general mental health and resilience. Additional outcomes included psychological symptoms of anxiety, depression or stress; burnout; other mental health disorders; workplace staffing; and adverse events arising from interventions. 
Data collection and analysis
Pairs of review authors independently applied selection criteria to abstracts and full papers, with disagreements resolved through discussion. One review author systematically extracted data, cross‐checked by a second review author. For objective 1, we assessed risk of bias of studies of effectiveness using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. For objective 2, we assessed methodological limitations using either the CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme) qualitative study tool, for qualitative studies, or WEIRD (Ways of Evaluating Important and Relevant Data) tool, for descriptive studies. We planned meta‐analyses of pairwise comparisons for outcomes if direct evidence were available. Two review authors extracted evidence relating to barriers and facilitators to implementation, organised these around the domains of the Consolidated Framework of Implementation Research, and used the GRADE‐CERQual approach to assess confidence in each finding. We planned to produce an overarching synthesis, bringing quantitative and qualitative findings together. 
Main results
We included 16 studies that reported implementation of an intervention aimed at supporting the resilience or mental health of frontline workers during disease outbreaks (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): 2; Ebola: 9; Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS): 1; COVID‐19: 4). Interventions studied included workplace interventions, such as training, structure and communication (6 studies); psychological support interventions, such as counselling and psychology services (8 studies); and multifaceted interventions (2 studies). 
Objective 1: a mixed‐methods study that incorporated a cluster‐randomised trial, investigating the effect of a work‐based intervention, provided very low‐certainty evidence about the effect of training frontline healthcare workers to deliver psychological first aid on a measure of burnout. 
Objective 2: we included all 16 studies in our qualitative evidence synthesis; we classified seven as qualitative and nine as descriptive studies. We identified 17 key findings from multiple barriers and facilitators reported in studies. We did not have high confidence in any of the findings; we had moderate confidence in six findings and low to very low confidence in 11 findings. We are moderately confident that the following two factors were barriers to intervention implementation: frontline workers, or the organisations in which they worked, not being fully aware of what they needed to support their mental well‐being; and a lack of equipment, staff time or skills needed for an intervention. We are moderately confident that the following three factors were facilitators of intervention implementation: interventions that could be adapted for local needs; having effective communication, both formally and socially; and having positive, safe and supportive learning environments for frontline workers. We are moderately confident that the knowledge or beliefs, or both, that people have about an intervention can act as either barriers or facilitators to implementation of the intervention. 
Authors' conclusions
There is a lack of both quantitative and qualitative evidence from studies carried out during or after disease epidemics and pandemics that can inform the selection of interventions that are beneficial to the resilience and mental health of frontline workers. Alternative sources of evidence (e.g. from other healthcare crises, and general evidence about interventions that support mental well‐being) could therefore be used to inform decision making. When selecting interventions aimed at supporting frontline workers' mental health, organisational, social, personal, and psychological factors may all be important. Research to determine the effectiveness of interventions is a high priority. The COVID‐19 pandemic provides unique opportunities for robust evaluation of interventions. Future studies must be developed with appropriately rigorous planning, including development, peer review and transparent reporting of research protocols, following guidance and standards for best practice, and with appropriate length of follow‐up. Factors that may act as barriers and facilitators to implementation of interventions should be considered during the planning of future research and when selecting interventions to deliver within local settings.

How Can We Best Help Frontline Workers with Their Mental Health During Disease Outbreaks?

### **Rationale**

Frontline health and social care workers have very hard jobs. During disease outbreaks, like the COVID-19 pandemic, their work is even more stressful. This stress can harm their mental health.

Workers may feel sad, worried, or anxious. This can make it hard for them to do their jobs. We need to find ways to help them cope with stress. This will support their well-being.

This study looked at past research on this topic. The researchers wanted to learn two main things. First, what are the best ways to help the mental health of frontline workers? Second, what makes it easy or hard to provide this help in the workplace? Finding these answers can help us take better care of our frontline workers.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a study with new patients. Instead, the researchers reviewed studies that were already done. They looked for research from the year 2002 up to May 2020.

The researchers looked for studies about frontline health workers. The workers in the studies had to be working during a major disease outbreak. These outbreaks included SARS, Ebola, MERS, and COVID-19.

The researchers searched for two types of studies.
*   The first type tested a program to help workers’ mental health. These studies compared workers who got the help with workers who did not.
*   The second type of study talked about what made it easy or hard to run these support programs.

Two researchers read each study to decide if it should be in the review. This helps make sure the best studies were chosen.

### **Results**

The researchers found 16 studies to review. The programs in these studies tried to help workers in different ways. Some gave workers special training. Others offered counseling or other mental health services.

The main results of the review were:

**1. Do we know what programs work best?**
The researchers found very little proof about what works best. Only one study really tested a program to see if it helped. The proof from this one study was very weak. Because of this, we still do not know for sure what programs are best for helping the mental health of frontline workers.

**2. What makes it easy or hard to help workers?**
The researchers found a few things that made it harder to run support programs.
*   Workers and their bosses did not always know what kind of help was needed.
*   There was often not enough time, staff, or tools to run a program well.

The researchers also found some things that made it easier to run support programs.
*   It was helpful when programs could be changed to fit the needs of a specific workplace.
*   Good, clear talks between staff and leaders were very important.
*   Having a safe and supportive place to learn and talk was also a big help.

The researchers concluded that we need more and better research. We need to find the best ways to help frontline workers during a crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic gives us a chance to do these important studies. When planning ways to help workers, it is key to think about their workplace, their social needs, and their personal feelings.","What is the best way to support resilience and mental well‐being in frontline healthcare professionals during and after a pandemic? 
What is ‘resilience’? 
Working as a 'frontline' health or social care professional during a global disease pandemic, like COVID‐19, can be very stressful. Over time, the negative effects of stress can lead to mental health problems such as depression and anxiety, which, in turn, may affect work, family and other social relationships. ‘Resilience’ is the ability to cope with the negative effects of stress and so avoid mental health problems and their wider effects. 
Healthcare providers can use various strategies (interventions) to support resilience and mental well‐being in their frontline healthcare professionals. These could include work‐based interventions, such as changing routines or improving equipment; or psychological support interventions, such as counselling. 
What did we want to find out? 
First (objective 1), we wanted to know how successfully any interventions improved frontline health professionals’ resilience or mental well‐being. 
Second (objective 2), we wanted to know what made it easier (facilitators) or harder (barriers) to deliver these interventions. 
What did we do? 
We searched medical databases for any kind of study that investigated interventions designed to support resilience and mental well‐being in healthcare professionals working at the front line during infectious disease outbreaks. The disease outbreaks had to be classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as epidemics or pandemics, and take place from 2002 onwards (the year before the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak). 
What did we find? 
We found 16 relevant studies. These studies came from different disease outbreaks ‐ two were from SARS; nine from Ebola; one from Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); and four from COVID‐19. The studies mainly looked at workplace interventions that involved either psychological support (for example, counselling or seeing a psychologist) or work‐based interventions (for example, giving training, or changing routines). 
Objective 1: one study investigated how well an intervention worked. This study was carried out immediately after the Ebola outbreak, and investigated whether staff who were training to give other people (such as patients and their family members) 'psychological first aid' felt less ‘burnt out’. We had some concerns about the results that this study reported and about some of its methods. This means that our certainty of the evidence is very low and we cannot say whether the intervention helped or not. 
Objective 2: all 16 studies provided some evidence about barriers and facilitators to implement interventions. We found 17 main findings from these studies. We do not have high confidence in any of the findings; we had moderate confidence in six findings and low to very low confidence in 11 findings. 
We are moderately confident that the following two factors were barriers to implementation of an intervention: frontline workers, or the organisations in which they worked, not being fully aware of what they needed to support their mental well‐being; and a lack of equipment, staff time or skills needed for an intervention. 
We are moderately confident that the following three factors were facilitators to implementation of an intervention: interventions that could be adapted for a local area; having effective communication, both formally within an organisation and informal or social networks; and having positive, safe and supportive learning environments for frontline healthcare professionals. 
We are moderately confident that the knowledge and beliefs that frontline healthcare professionals have about an intervention can either help or hinder implementation of the intervention. 
Key messages 
We did not find any evidence that tells us about how well different strategies work at supporting the resilience and mental well‐being of frontline workers. We found some limited evidence about things that might help successful delivery of interventions. Properly planned research studies to find out the best ways to support the resilience and mental well‐being of health and social care workers are urgently required.

Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe and debilitating condition. Several pharmacological interventions have been proposed with the aim to prevent or mitigate it. These interventions should balance efficacy and tolerability, given that not all individuals exposed to a traumatic event will develop PTSD. There are different possible approaches to preventing PTSD; universal prevention is aimed at individuals at risk of developing PTSD on the basis of having been exposed to a traumatic event, irrespective of whether they are showing signs of psychological difficulties. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and acceptability of pharmacological interventions for universal prevention of PTSD in adults exposed to a traumatic event. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMDCTR), CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases and two trials registers (November 2020). We checked the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews. The search was last updated on 13 November 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised clinical trials on adults exposed to any kind of traumatic event. We considered comparisons of any medication with placebo or with another medication. We excluded trials that investigated medications as an augmentation to psychotherapy. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. In a random‐effects model, we analysed dichotomous data as risk ratios (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/NNTH). We analysed continuous data as mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD). 
Main results
We included 13 studies which considered eight interventions (hydrocortisone, propranolol, dexamethasone, omega‐3 fatty acids, gabapentin, paroxetine, PulmoCare enteral formula, Oxepa enteral formula and 5‐hydroxytryptophan) and involved 2023 participants, with a single trial contributing 1244 participants. Eight studies enrolled participants from emergency departments or trauma centres or similar settings. Participants were exposed to a range of both intentional and unintentional traumatic events. Five studies considered participants in the context of intensive care units with traumatic events consisting of severe physical illness. Our concerns about risk of bias in the included studies were mostly due to high attrition and possible selective reporting. We could meta‐analyse data for two comparisons: hydrocortisone versus placebo, but limited to secondary outcomes; and propranolol versus placebo. No study compared hydrocortisone to placebo at the primary endpoint of three months after the traumatic event. 
The evidence on whether propranolol was more effective in reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms compared to placebo at three months after the traumatic event is inconclusive, because of serious risk of bias amongst the included studies, serious inconsistency amongst the studies' results, and very serious imprecision of the estimate of effect (SMD ‐0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.61 to 0.59; I2 = 83%; 3 studies, 86 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No study provided data on dropout rates due to side effects at three months post‐traumatic event. The evidence on whether propranolol was more effective than placebo in reducing the probability of experiencing PTSD at three months after the traumatic event is inconclusive, because of serious risk of bias amongst the included studies, and very serious imprecision of the estimate of effect (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.92; 3 studies, 88 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No study assessed functional disability or quality of life.  
Only one study compared gabapentin to placebo at the primary endpoint of three months after the traumatic event, with inconclusive evidence in terms of both PTSD severity and probability of experiencing PTSD, because of imprecision of the effect estimate, serious risk of bias and serious imprecision (very low‐certainty evidence). We found no data on dropout rates due to side effects, functional disability or quality of life. 
For the remaining comparisons, the available data are inconclusive or missing in terms of PTSD severity reduction and dropout rates due to adverse events. No study assessed functional disability. 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides uncertain evidence only regarding the use of hydrocortisone, propranolol, dexamethasone, omega‐3 fatty acids, gabapentin, paroxetine, PulmoCare formula, Oxepa formula, or 5‐hydroxytryptophan as universal PTSD prevention strategies. Future research might benefit from larger samples, better reporting of side effects and inclusion of quality of life and functioning measures.

Can Medicines Stop PTSD After a Bad Event? A Review of Past Studies

**Rationale**

**What is PTSD?**

Post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, is a health problem. It can happen after a person goes through a very scary or bad event. This is called a traumatic event. PTSD can make a person’s life very hard. They may feel scared, sad, or angry for a long time after the event is over.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Researchers want to find ways to help people after a bad event. One idea is to give a medicine right away. The hope is that the medicine can stop PTSD from starting.

This is called “universal prevention.” It means giving a medicine to anyone who has been through a bad event. This is done even if they do not show any signs of PTSD yet.

It is important that any medicine used for this is safe. It should not have bad side effects. This is because not everyone who has a bad event will get PTSD. This study looked at past research to see if any medicines worked well and were safe to prevent PTSD.

**Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. The researchers did not do a new experiment with new people. Instead, they looked for all the good studies that had already been done. They wanted to combine the results from all these past studies to get a stronger answer.

The researchers found 13 studies to look at. In total, these studies included more than 2000 adults. These adults had all been through a bad event. Some were in the emergency room after things like a car crash. Others were very sick in the hospital’s intensive care unit.

In the studies, people were put into groups by chance. One group got a real medicine. The other group got a placebo. A placebo is a pill with no medicine in it, like a sugar pill. This helps researchers see if the real medicine works better than nothing. The researchers looked at how people were doing about 3 months after the bad event.

**Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The researchers did not find a clear answer. The information from the 13 studies was not strong enough to say if any medicine can prevent PTSD. The evidence was very uncertain.

The review looked at eight different medicines and special food formulas. For most of them, there was not enough information to make any decision.

For a medicine called propranolol, the results were mixed. The studies that tested it had different findings. Because of this, the researchers could not tell if propranolol worked better than a sugar pill to prevent PTSD.

There were some problems with the studies that were reviewed. In many of them, people dropped out before the study was over. Some studies also may not have reported all of their results. These problems make it hard to be sure about the findings. Also, the studies did not report much about side effects. They also did not ask people if the medicine helped them get back to their normal daily life.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

The authors of this review concluded that we still do not know if any of these medicines can stop PTSD from starting. The evidence is not clear enough.

More and better research is needed to find an answer. Future studies should include more people. They also need to do a better job of tracking side effects. It is also important for new studies to ask people about their quality of life to see if a treatment is truly helpful.","Medicines for preventing post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
Why is this review important? 
Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe and disabling condition which may develop in people exposed to traumatic events. Such events can have long‐lasting negative repercussions on the lives of those who have experienced them, as well as on the lives of loved ones. 
Research has shown that there are some alterations in how the brain works in people with PTSD. Some researchers have thus proposed using medicines to target these alterations soon after a traumatic event, as a way to prevent the development of PTSD. However, the majority of people who experience a traumatic event will not develop PTSD. Therefore, medicines that can be given soon after exposure to a traumatic event must be carefully evaluated for their effectiveness, including balancing the risk of side effects against the risk of developing PTSD. 
Who will be interested? 
‐ People exposed to traumatic events and their family, friends, and loved ones
‐ Professionals working in mental health 
‐ Professionals working in traumatology and emergency medicine
‐ People caring for victims of traumatic experiences and veterans of the armed forces
What questions did this review try to answer? 
For people exposed to a traumatic event, whether or not they have psychological symptoms, are some medicines more effective than other medicines or placebo (dummy pills) in: 
‐ reducing the severity of symptoms of PTSD?
‐ reducing the number of people stopping the medication because of side effects?
‐ reducing the probability of developing PTSD?
Which studies were included? 
We searched scientific databases for studies in which participants were randomly assigned to a medicine with the aim of preventing PTSD and its symptoms or reducing severity. We included studies published up until November 2020. We selected studies in adults who had experienced any kind of traumatic event, and which provided treatment, regardless of whether or not the participants had psychological symptoms. 
We included 13 studies, with a total of 2023 participants. One study alone contributed 1244 participants. The studies took place in different settings and involved people exposed to a wide range of traumatic events. Some studies took place in emergency departments and considered people whose trauma resulted from intentional harm or unintentional harm. Other studies focused on life‐threatening illness as the source of trauma, including major surgeries or being admitted to intensive care units. The medicines most commonly given to participants in the studies included: hydrocortisone (which reduces the body's immune response), propranolol (used to treat heart problems and anxiety, amongst other conditions), and gabapentin (a medicine primarily used to treat seizures and nerve pain). 
What did the evidence tell us? 
We found four trials comparing hydrocortisone to placebo. These trials did not report how participants were doing at three months after a traumatic event, a time point that is usually useful to assess the evolution of PTSD symptoms. 
We found very low‐certainty evidence about propranolol compared to placebo three months after a traumatic event. This evidence does not tell us whether or not propranolol is more effective than placebo in reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms and the probability of developing PTSD. We did not find evidence on the probability of people stopping the medication because of side effects, quality of life, or functional disability (a measure of how much one’s life is limited by symptoms). 
We found very low‐certainty evidence about gabapentin compared to placebo three months after a traumatic event. This evidence does not tell us whether or not gabapentin is more effective than placebo in reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms and the probability of developing PTSD. We did not find evidence on the probability of people stopping the medication because of side effects, quality of life, or functional disability. 
We found studies on additional medicines, for which information about the reduction of PTSD severity and the probability of people stopping the medication was either inconclusive or missing. 
None of the included studies measured the functional disability of participants.
What should happen next? 
The evidence we found does not support the use of any medicines for the prevention of PTSD in people exposed to a traumatic event, regardless of whether or not they have psychological symptoms. More higher quality studies involving more people are needed to draw conclusions about these treatments.

Background 
Flare ups of symptoms (exacerbations) in people with cystic fibrosis are treated aggressively to prevent further damage to the lungs.

**Plain Title**

How Long Should a Person with Cystic Fibrosis Get IV Antibiotics for a Chest Infection?

**Rationale**

Cystic fibrosis is a health problem that people are born with. It causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the body. This mucus can clog the lungs. This makes it hard to breathe. It also makes it easy for germs to grow in the lungs.

When germs grow in the lungs, it can cause a bad chest infection. These infections are sometimes called flare-ups. A flare-up can make a person cough more and feel very sick. Flare-ups can also cause more damage to the lungs over time. To stop this damage, doctors treat these infections right away with strong medicines.

Doctors use medicines called antibiotics to fight the germs. For bad flare-ups, these antibiotics are often given through a small tube in a vein. This is called IV treatment. The medicine goes right into the blood. This helps it work quickly.

The main question is how long people need this IV treatment. Right now, there are no clear rules for doctors to follow. Some doctors give the medicine for 10 days. Other doctors give it for 14 days. If a person is not getting better, they may get the medicine for 21 days. We did this review to find out what science says is the best length of time for treatment.

**Trial Design**

This was not a study where we gave medicine to patients. Instead, we did a review. A review means we look for all the studies that have already been done on a topic. We wanted to find studies that compared different lengths of IV antibiotic treatment.

For example, we looked for a study where one group of people with cystic fibrosis got medicine for 10 days. Then, another group would get the same medicine for 14 days. The study would then see which group did better.

Our review looked for studies with people of any age who have cystic fibrosis. These people had to be getting IV antibiotics for a chest flare-up. We searched for all studies that were published up to May 2019.

**Results**

What were the main results of our review? We did not find any finished studies that answered our question. This was a surprise. It means that we still do not have clear proof about the best length of time for treatment.

We did learn that one study on this topic is happening now. When that study is finished, we hope to add its results to our review. Until then, doctors and patients must decide on the length of treatment without clear guidance from research.

This is important because the length of treatment matters. A shorter treatment time could have benefits. It might be easier for a person to finish the full treatment. It could also cost less money. Being on IV antibiotics for a shorter time may also lead to fewer side effects from the medicine.

But there are also questions about shorter treatments. We do not know if a shorter treatment time is strong enough to clear the infection fully. If the infection is not cleared, it might come back sooner. This could lead to a person having flare-ups more often. More research is needed to find the right balance.

Our final conclusion is that we need new studies. These studies must compare shorter and longer IV antibiotic treatments. This research will help us find the safest and best way to treat chest flare-ups in people with cystic fibrosis.","Length of time needed for antibiotic treatment given directly into the blood stream to clear acute chest infections in people with cystic fibrosis

10.1002-14651858.CD011106.pub2,"The usefulness of protocols for reducing the time newborn infants spend on mechanical ventilation in the neonatal intensive care unit 
Review question 
Are protocols useful for reducing the time newborn infants spend on mechanical ventilation in the neonatal intensive care unit?  Background 
Mechanical ventilation is used to help newborns to breath when they are too sick or born too premature to breath on their own. However, mechanical ventilation is not without risk, and can cause (permanent) damage to the lungs. For example, the pressure needed to fill the lungs with air may destroy the very fragile air sacs, and result in scaring of the lungs. For this reason, it is important to recognize when a newborn is mature and strong enough to start breathing for himself/herself, and to reduce (wean) the ventilator support. There is, unfortunately, no current agreement on the best way to wean newborns off the ventilator. Researchers have studied the usefulness of standardized protocols to guide the process of weaning off the ventilator in adults and children. In adults, 17 studies of weaning protocols have shown benefit in helping the doctors and nurses wean adults off the ventilator in a safe and timely manner. In children, three studies of weaning protocols have shown they are beneficial in reducing time on the ventilator, but the studies were too few to show harms.

Looking for the Best Way to Help Newborn Babies Breathe on Their Own

### **Rationale**

**Why did we need this study?**

Some babies are born too early. Other babies are born very sick. These babies can be too weak to breathe well on their own. They need help from a special machine called a ventilator. This machine breathes for them. It gives them time to get stronger. Babies who need this help are cared for in a special part of the hospital. This part is called the neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU.

A breathing machine can save a baby’s life. But using the machine for too long can also cause problems. A baby’s lungs are very small and can be hurt easily. The air from the machine can damage the tiny air sacs in the lungs. This can cause scars in the lungs that may last a long time.

Because of this risk, doctors want to take babies off the breathing machine as soon as they are strong enough to breathe by themselves. The process of slowly taking a baby off the machine is called “weaning.”

Right now, doctors have different ways to wean babies from a breathing machine. There is no agreement on which way is best. For adults and older children, studies show that using a set of rules, called a protocol, helps. A protocol gives doctors and nurses clear steps to follow. This helps them wean patients off the machine safely and as quickly as possible. We wanted to know if a set of rules would also help newborn babies.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a study that tested a treatment on new patients. Instead, the researchers looked for studies that had already been done. This kind of study is called a review. Think of it like going to a library to find all the books ever written on one topic. The researchers’ goal was to find all the past studies that looked at using a set of rules for weaning newborn babies off breathing machines.

The researchers searched for studies that included only newborn babies. A newborn is a baby in the first 28 days of life. They looked for studies that compared weaning with a set of rules to weaning without a set of rules. By bringing all the results together, the researchers hoped to see if using a set of rules was better for newborns.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The researchers looked very carefully for past studies. After searching, they found no studies that looked at using a set of rules for weaning in just newborn babies.

They did find two studies that included some newborns. But those studies also included older babies and children. The results for the newborns were mixed in with the results for the older children. This meant the researchers could not look at the information for just the newborns.

Because no studies were found, we still do not know if using a set of rules to wean babies from a breathing machine is helpful or harmful. There is no proof either way.

This review shows that there is a big gap in medical research. New studies are needed to find the safest and best way to help newborn babies get off breathing machines and breathe on their own.","The usefulness of protocols for reducing the time newborn infants spend on mechanical ventilation in the neonatal intensive care unit 
Review question 
Are protocols useful for reducing the time newborn infants spend on mechanical ventilation in the neonatal intensive care unit?  Background 
Mechanical ventilation is used to help newborns to breath when they are too sick or born too premature to breath on their own. However, mechanical ventilation is not without risk, and can cause (permanent) damage to the lungs. For example, the pressure needed to fill the lungs with air may destroy the very fragile air sacs, and result in scaring of the lungs. For this reason, it is important to recognize when a newborn is mature and strong enough to start breathing for himself/herself, and to reduce (wean) the ventilator support. There is, unfortunately, no current agreement on the best way to wean newborns off the ventilator. Researchers have studied the usefulness of standardized protocols to guide the process of weaning off the ventilator in adults and children. In adults, 17 studies of weaning protocols have shown benefit in helping the doctors and nurses wean adults off the ventilator in a safe and timely manner. In children, three studies of weaning protocols have shown they are beneficial in reducing time on the ventilator, but the studies were too few to show harms. As yet, we do not know if weaning protocols in neonates provide benefits or harms. However, these standardized protocols have supplied us with firm evidence for their usefulness in weaning from mechanical ventilation in the care of children.  Study characteristics 
The purpose of this review was to look at weaning protocol studies in newborn infants to see if we could draw conclusions on their usefulness for weaning practice in neonatal care.  Key results  We found no studies that involved newborn infants before the 28th day of life. We found two studies with a subpopulation of newborns, but we were not able to extract the data from this subgroup out of the total group studied.  Quality of evidence

Pressure ulcers (also known as pressure injuries, pressure sores and bed sores) are localised injuries to the skin or underlying soft tissue, or both, caused by unrelieved pressure, shear or friction. Specific kinds of beds, overlays and mattresses are widely used with the aim of preventing and treating pressure ulcers. 
Objectives
To summarise evidence from Cochrane Reviews that assess the effects of beds, overlays and mattresses on reducing the incidence of pressure ulcers and on increasing pressure ulcer healing in any setting and population. 
To assess the relative effects of different types of beds, overlays and mattresses for reducing the incidence of pressure ulcers and increasing pressure ulcer healing in any setting and population. 
To cumulatively rank the different treatment options of beds, overlays and mattresses in order of their effectiveness in pressure ulcer prevention and treatment. 
Methods
In July 2020, we searched the Cochrane Library. Cochrane Reviews reporting the effectiveness of beds, mattresses or overlays for preventing or treating pressure ulcers were eligible for inclusion in this overview. Two review authors independently screened search results and undertook data extraction and risk of bias assessment using the ROBIS tool. We summarised the reported evidence in an overview of reviews. Where possible, we included the randomised controlled trials from each included review in network meta‐analyses. We assessed the relative effectiveness of beds, overlays and mattresses for preventing or treating pressure ulcers and their probabilities of being, comparably, the most effective treatment. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We include six Cochrane Reviews in this overview of reviews, all at low or unclear risk of bias. 
Pressure ulcer prevention: four reviews (of 68 studies with 18,174 participants) report direct evidence for 27 pairwise comparisons between 12 types of support surface on the following outcomes: pressure ulcer incidence, time to pressure ulcer incidence, patient comfort response, adverse event rates, health‐related quality of life, and cost‐effectiveness. Here we focus on outcomes with some evidence at a minimum of low certainty. 
(1) Pressure ulcer incidence: our overview includes direct evidence for 27 comparisons that mostly (19/27) have very low‐certainty evidence concerning reduction of pressure ulcer risk. We included 40 studies (12,517 participants; 1298 participants with new ulcers) in a network meta‐analysis involving 13 types of intervention. Data informing the network are sparse and this, together with the high risk of bias in most studies informing the network, means most network contrasts (64/78) yield evidence of very low certainty. There is low‐certainty evidence that, compared with foam surfaces (reference treatment), reactive air surfaces (e.g. static air overlays) (risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 0.75), alternating pressure (active) air surfaces (e.g. alternating pressure air mattresses, large‐celled ripple mattresses) (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.93), and reactive gel surfaces (e.g. gel pads used on operating tables) (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.01) may reduce pressure ulcer incidence. The ranking of treatments in terms of effectiveness is also of very low certainty for all interventions. It is unclear which treatment is best for preventing ulceration. 
(2) Time to pressure ulcer incidence: four reviews had direct evidence on this outcome for seven comparisons. We included 10 studies (7211 participants; 699 participants with new ulcers) evaluating six interventions in a network meta‐analysis. Again, data from most network contrasts (13/15) are of very low certainty. There is low‐certainty evidence that, compared with foam surfaces (reference treatment), reactive air surfaces may reduce the hazard of developing new pressure ulcers (hazard ratio (HR) 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.05). The ranking of all support surfaces for preventing pressure ulcers in terms of time to healing is uncertain. 
(3) Cost‐effectiveness: this overview includes direct evidence for three comparisons. For preventing pressure ulcers, alternating pressure air surfaces are probably more cost‐effective than foam surfaces (moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Pressure ulcer treatment: two reviews (of 12 studies with 972 participants) report direct evidence for five comparisons on: complete pressure ulcer healing, time to complete pressure ulcer healing, patient comfort response, adverse event rates, and cost‐effectiveness. Here we focus on outcomes with some evidence at a minimum of low certainty. 
(1) Complete pressure ulcer healing: our overview includes direct evidence for five comparisons. There is uncertainty about the relative effects of beds, overlays and mattresses on ulcer healing. The corresponding network meta‐analysis (with four studies, 397 participants) had only three direct contrasts and a total of six network contrasts. Again, most network contrasts (5/6) have very low‐certainty evidence. There was low‐certainty evidence that more people with pressure ulcers may heal completely using reactive air surfaces than using foam surfaces (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.80). We are uncertain which surfaces have the highest probability of being the most effective (all very low‐certainty evidence). 
(2) Time to complete pressure ulcer healing: this overview includes direct evidence for one comparison: people using reactive air surfaces may be more likely to have healed pressure ulcers compared with those using foam surfaces in long‐term care settings (HR 2.66, 95% CI 1.34 to 5.17; low‐certainty evidence). 
(3) Cost‐effectiveness: this overview includes direct evidence for one comparison: compared with foam surfaces, reactive air surfaces may cost an extra 26 US dollars for every ulcer‐free day in the first year of use in long‐term care settings (low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Compared with foam surfaces, reactive air surfaces may reduce pressure ulcer risk and may increase complete ulcer healing. Compared with foam surfaces, alternating pressure air surfaces may reduce pressure ulcer risk and are probably more cost‐effective in preventing pressure ulcers. Compared with foam surfaces, reactive gel surfaces may reduce pressure ulcer risk, particularly for people in operating rooms and long‐term care settings. There are uncertainties for the relative effectiveness of other support surfaces for preventing and treating pressure ulcers, and their efficacy ranking. 
More high‐quality research is required; for example, for the comparison of reactive air surfaces with alternating pressure air surfaces. Future studies should consider time‐to‐event outcomes and be designed to minimise any risk of bias. 
","Here is the Plain Language Summary of the biomedical study:

### **Plain Title**

Which Beds and Mattresses Are Best to Prevent and Heal Bed Sores?

### **Rationale**

Bed sores are painful wounds on the skin. They are also called pressure sores. They can happen when you stay in one position for too long. This often happens to people who must stay in bed or in a wheelchair. The pressure cuts off blood flow to the skin, causing damage. These sores can be very serious and hard to heal.

Doctors often use special beds, mattresses, or pads to help. These are called support surfaces. They are designed to spread out a person's weight and take the pressure off their skin. There are many different types of these surfaces. We do not know for sure which type works best.

This study looked at past research on this topic. The researchers wanted to compare all the different types of beds and mattresses. Their goal was to find out which ones work best to stop bed sores from forming. They also wanted to see which ones are best for healing sores that are already there.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with its own patients. Instead, the researchers gathered and reviewed studies that were already completed. This type of study is called an overview of reviews. It helps to combine the results from many studies to get a bigger and clearer picture.

The researchers looked at 68 past studies. These studies included over 18,000 people to see how to prevent bed sores. The studies also included almost 1,000 people to see how to treat existing bed sores. The people in these studies were in places like hospitals and nursing homes. They were at risk of getting bed sores or already had them. Because this was a review of many studies, the amount of time people were followed was different in each one.

The researchers grouped the different support surfaces. The main types they looked at were:
*   Standard foam mattresses.
*   Special air mattresses where the air pockets stay filled.
*   Special air mattresses where the air pockets fill and empty in a cycle.
*   Special mattresses or pads made with gel.

### **Results**

The researchers compared the special surfaces to a standard foam mattress. They were careful to say how sure they were about the results. For many findings, they were not very sure. This means that more research is needed to know for sure.

**What did the study find about stopping bed sores?**

*   Special air mattresses where the air pockets stay filled may lower the risk of getting a bed sore compared to foam.
*   Special air mattresses that have air moving in cycles may also lower the risk of getting a bed sore. These mattresses were also found to be a good value for the money.
*   Pads made of gel may lower the risk of getting a sore. This seemed to be especially true for people during surgery.

**What did the study find about healing bed sores?**

*   Special air mattresses where the air pockets stay filled may help sores heal completely.
*   These same air mattresses may also help sores heal faster than a standard foam mattress.

**What is the main takeaway?**

This review suggests that some special surfaces may work better than a standard foam mattress. Special mattresses that use air or gel may help both prevent and heal bed sores. However, the researchers could not say that one type was the very best.

The researchers concluded that we still need more high-quality studies. Future research will help doctors and patients be more certain about which bed or mattress is the right choice to prevent and treat painful bed sores.","What are the benefits and risks of beds, mattresses and overlays for preventing and treating pressure ulcers? 
The overview presents a lot of data from randomised controlled trials and contains an advanced analysis called 'network meta‐analysis'. The analysis allows comparisons of all types of support surfaces for preventing or treating pressure ulcers. This interactive tool may help with navigation of the datahttps://stopthepressure.shinyapps.io/Cochrane_support_surface_reviews/. 
Key messages 
Static air mattresses or overlays, alternating pressure air mattresses or overlays, and gel pads used on operating tables may be better than foam mattresses for preventing pressure ulcers. 
Compared with foam mattresses, alternating pressure air mattresses or overlays probably result in health benefits that outweigh their costs in preventing pressure ulcers. 
Static air mattresses or overlays may be better than foam mattresses for ulcer healing, but may cost more. 
It is unclear what the best treatment is for either preventing or treating pressure ulcers; what the effects of these treatment options are on people’s comfort and quality of life; and whether or not there are any unwanted effects. 
What are pressure ulcers? 
Pressure ulcers (also known as pressure sores or bed sores) are wounds to the skin and underlying tissue caused by prolonged pressure or rubbing. People who have mobility problems or who lie in bed for long periods are at risk of developing pressure ulcers. 
What did we want to find out? 
There are many types of beds, mattresses and overlays specifically designed for people with pressure ulcers. These can be made from a range of materials (such as foam, air cells and gel pads) and are divided into two groups: 
‐ reactive (static) surfaces that apply a constant pressure to the skin; and
‐ active (alternating pressure) surfaces that regularly redistribute the pressure under the body. 
We wanted to find out if different types of reactive and active surfaces:
‐ prevent pressure ulcers;
‐ help ulcers to heal;
‐ are comfortable and improve people’s quality of life;
‐ have health benefits that outweigh their costs; and
‐ have any unwanted effects.
We also wanted to find out what the best treatment options are for either preventing or healing pressure ulcers. 
What did we do? 
We searched for Cochrane Reviews that summarised the results of all available carefully designed studies (controlled trials) evaluating different beds, mattresses and overlays in preventing and treating pressure ulcers. A Cochrane Review provides a high level of evidence on the effectiveness of healthcare interventions. We summarised the results of these reviews in a single document (called an overview of reviews). 
We also collected studies included in these reviews and compared all available treatments at the same time in a single analysis (called network meta‐analysis). We then summarised these results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
Effects in preventing pressure ulcers  
We found four reviews on the use of beds, mattresses and overlays for preventing pressure ulcers. From these, we included 40 studies (12,517 people) in a network meta‐analysis evaluating reduction of pressure ulcer risk. The network meta‐analysis evidence suggests that static (reactive) air overlays, alternating pressure air mattresses, and (reactive) gel pads used on operating tables may reduce pressure ulcer risk compared with foam mattresses. 
We also included 10 studies (7211 people) in a network meta‐analysis evaluating the time taken for new ulcers to develop. The network meta‐analysis evidence suggests that reactive air surfaces may reduce the chances of developing new ulcers compared with foam surfaces. 
Effects in treating pressure ulcers  
We found two reviews on pressure ulcer healing. From these, we included four studies (397 people) in a network meta‐analysis. The network meta‐analysis evidence suggests that more people with ulcers may heal completely using reactive air surfaces than foam surfaces. 
The overview evidence suggests that, if the time needed to completely heal an ulcer is looked at, reactive air surfaces may improve the chances of pressure ulcers healing when compared with foam mattresses. 
However, it is unclear which treatment is best for either preventing or treating pressure ulcers. 
Other effects in preventing and treating pressure ulcers  
The overview evidence suggests that:
‐ compared with foam mattresses, alternating pressure air surfaces probably result in health benefits that outweigh their costs in preventing pressure ulcers; 
‐ reactive air‐filled surfaces may cost more than foam mattresses in healing ulcers; and 
‐ the other benefits and risks of these beds, mattresses and mattress overlays are unclear. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Although the reviews we found used reliable methods, most of the studies in them were small and used methods likely to introduce errors in their results. 
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
The evidence in this overview is current to July 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD013495.pub2,"Background
Depression and anxiety are the most frequent indication for which antidepressants are prescribed. Long‐term antidepressant use is driving much of the internationally observed rise in antidepressant consumption. Surveys of antidepressant users suggest that 30% to 50% of long‐term antidepressant prescriptions had no evidence‐based indication. Unnecessary use of antidepressants puts people at risk of adverse events. However, high‐certainty evidence is lacking regarding the effectiveness and safety of approaches to discontinuing long‐term antidepressants. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of approaches for discontinuation versus continuation of long‐term antidepressant use for depressive and anxiety disorders in adults. 
Search methods
We searched all databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) until January 2020.
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing approaches to discontinuation with continuation of antidepressants (or usual care) for people with depression or anxiety who are prescribed antidepressants for at least six months. Interventions included discontinuation alone (abrupt or taper), discontinuation with psychological therapy support, and discontinuation with minimal intervention. Primary outcomes were successful discontinuation rate,relapse (as defined by authors of the original study), withdrawal symptoms, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, quality of life, social and occupational functioning, and severity of illness. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. 
Main results
We included 33 studies involving 4995 participants. Nearly all studies were conducted in a specialist mental healthcare service and included participants with recurrent depression (i.e. two or more episodes of depression prior to discontinuation). All included trials were at high risk of bias. The main limitation of the review is bias due to confounding withdrawal symptoms with symptoms of relapse of depression. Withdrawal symptoms (such as low mood, dizziness) may have an effect on almost every outcome including adverse events, quality of life, social functioning, and severity of illness. 
Abrupt discontinuation  
Thirteen studies reported abrupt discontinuation of antidepressant.
Very low‐certainty evidence suggests that abrupt discontinuation without psychological support may increase risk of relapse (hazard ratio (HR) 2.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.59 to 2.74; 1373 participants, 10 studies) and there is insufficient evidence of its effect on adverse events (odds ratio (OR) 1.11, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.99; 1012 participants, 7 studies; I² = 37%) compared to continuation of antidepressants, without specific assessment of withdrawal symptoms. Evidence about the effects of abrupt discontinuation on withdrawal symptoms (1 study) is very uncertain. 
None of these studies included successful discontinuation rate as a primary endpoint. 
Discontinuation by ""taper""  
Eighteen studies examined discontinuation by ""tapering"" (one week or longer). Most tapering regimens lasted four weeks or less. 
Very low‐certainty evidence suggests that ""tapered"" discontinuation may lead to higher risk of relapse (HR 2.97, 95% CI 2.24 to 3.93; 1546 participants, 13 studies) with no or little difference in adverse events (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.38; 1479 participants, 7 studies; I² = 0%) compared to continuation of antidepressants, without specific assessment of withdrawal symptoms. Evidence about the effects of discontinuation on withdrawal symptoms (1 study) is very uncertain. 
Discontinuation with psychological support  
Four studies reported discontinuation with psychological support. Very low‐certainty evidence suggests that initiation of preventive cognitive therapy (PCT), or MBCT, combined with ""tapering"" may result in successful discontinuation rates of 40% to 75% in the discontinuation group (690 participants, 3 studies). Data from control groups in these studies were requested but are not yet available. 
Low‐certainty evidence suggests that discontinuation combined with psychological intervention may result in no or little effect on relapse (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.19; 690 participants, 3 studies) compared to continuation of antidepressants. Withdrawal symptoms were not measured. Pooling data on adverse events was not possible due to insufficient information (3 studies). 
Discontinuation with minimal intervention  
Low‐certainty evidence from one study suggests that a letter to the general practitioner (GP) to review antidepressant treatment may result in no or little effect on successful discontinuation rate compared to usual care (6% versus 8%; 146 participants, 1 study) or on relapse (relapse rate 26% vs 13%; 146 participants, 1 study). No data on withdrawal symptoms nor adverse events were provided. 
None of the studies used low‐intensity psychological interventions such as online support or a changed pharmaceutical formulation that allows tapering with low doses over several months. Insufficient data were available for the majority of people taking antidepressants in the community (i.e. those with only one or no prior episode of depression), for people aged 65 years and older, and for people taking antidepressants for anxiety. 
Authors' conclusions
Currently, relatively few studies have focused on approaches to discontinuation of long‐term antidepressants. We cannot make any firm conclusions about effects and safety of the approaches studied to date. The true effect and safety are likely to be substantially different from the data presented due to assessment of relapse of depression that is confounded by withdrawal symptoms. All other outcomes are confounded with withdrawal symptoms. Most tapering regimens were limited to four weeks or less. In the studies with rapid tapering schemes the risk of withdrawal symptoms may be similar to studies using abrupt discontinuation which may influence the effectiveness of the interventions. Nearly all data come from people with recurrent depression.   
There is an urgent need for trials that adequately address withdrawal confounding bias, and carefully distinguish relapse from withdrawal symptoms. Future studies should report key outcomes such as successful discontinuation rate and should include populations with one or no prior depression episodes in primary care, older people, and people taking antidepressants for anxiety and use tapering schemes longer than 4 weeks.

A Review of Studies on How to Safely Stop Taking Antidepressant Drugs

**Rationale**

Depression and anxiety are common health problems. Many people take medicines called antidepressants to help with these conditions. These medicines can work very well and help people feel better.

Today, more people use these drugs for a long time, sometimes for many years. But some people may not need to stay on them for their whole life. Taking any medicine for a long time can lead to unwanted side effects. We need to be sure that people only take them when they are needed.

When a person wants to stop taking an antidepressant, it can be difficult. We do not have clear proof about the safest and best ways to stop. This makes it hard for doctors to give good advice. Researchers did this study to look at all the past research. They wanted to find out what we know about stopping these important medicines.

**Trial Design**

The researchers did not do a new study with new patients. Instead, they looked for all the studies that were already done on this topic. They gathered information from 33 different studies.

These studies included about 5,000 adults who had depression or anxiety. Everyone in the studies had been taking antidepressants for at least six months. Most of them had experienced depression more than once in their lives.

The studies compared different ways of stopping the medicine. Some people continued taking their medicine as usual. Others tried to stop. The ways of stopping included:
*   Stopping the medicine all at once.
*   Slowly lowering the dose over time. This is called “tapering”.
*   Getting talk therapy to help them while they were tapering the medicine.

Researchers looked at how many people were able to stop the medicine. They also checked to see if the depression came back. And they looked at side effects and other problems people might have when stopping, called withdrawal symptoms.

**Results**

The researchers found it was very hard to get clear answers from the studies. This was because the studies had a big problem. They often confused two different things: withdrawal symptoms and a return of depression.

Withdrawal can happen when you stop a medicine your body is used to. It can cause symptoms like low mood, feeling dizzy, or feeling sick. A return of depression, called a relapse, is when the original illness comes back. Because the studies mixed these two things up, their results are very uncertain.

Here is what the review found about the different ways to stop:

*   **Stopping suddenly:** This seemed to raise the risk that depression would come back.
*   **Stopping slowly (tapering):** Most studies only used a short tapering plan of four weeks or less. This also seemed to raise the risk of depression coming back. This may be because the plan to lower the dose was too fast.
*   **Stopping with talk therapy:** This approach seemed to be more helpful. In these studies, about 4 to 7 out of every 10 people who got talk therapy were able to stop taking their medicine. This method did not seem to raise the risk of depression coming back.

The researchers concluded that we urgently need more and better studies on this topic. The information we have now is not strong enough to guide doctors and patients. They believe the high risk of relapse reported in many studies might be wrong. It may actually be the result of withdrawal symptoms that were not managed well.

New studies are needed. These studies must be careful to tell the difference between withdrawal and relapse. They should also test much slower plans for lowering the dose. And they need to include people who are often left out of research. This includes older adults, people with anxiety, and those who have had only one episode of depression.","Stopping long‐term antidepressants in people with depression or anxiety
Review question 
We aimed to find out if it is effective and safe to stop antidepressants for people with depression or anxiety who have been taking them for six months or longer. 
We compared different approaches for stopping long‐term antidepressants versus continuation. We looked at benefits (e.g. successful discontinuation rate) and harms, such as return of the depressive or anxiety episode (relapse), side effects, and withdrawal symptoms (i.e. symptoms people experience when stopping an antidepressant). 
Background 
Antidepressants are widely used for depression and anxiety. Guidelines recommend that an antidepressant should be continued for at least six months after people start to feel better, and for at least two years if they have had two or more periods of depression. Many people take antidepressants for much longer, and as they can cause unpleasant side effects, long‐term use puts people at risk of harm that may outweigh the benefits. 
Study characteristics 
Our search up until January 2020 found 33 studies, which included 4995 adult participants. Most people in these studies had recurrent depression (two or more episodes of depression before stopping antidepressants), and most were recruited from specialist mental healthcare services. In 13 studies, the antidepressant was stopped abruptly; in 18 studies, the antidepressant was stopped gradually over several weeks (""tapering""); in four studies, psychological therapy support was also offered; and in one study, stopping was prompted by a letter to the GP with guidance on tapering. Most tapering schemes lasted four weeks or less. 
Key results 
We found very low‐certainty evidence suggesting that abrupt stopping may lead to higher risk of relapse and there was insufficient evidence of its effect on occurrence of side effects compared to continuation of the antidepressant. 
We found very low‐certainty evidence suggesting that ""tapering"" over a few weeks may lead to higher risk of a return and again may have little or no effect on side effects compared to continuation. 
We found evidence of very low to low certainty to suggest that stopping the antidepressant in combination with providing preventive cognitive therapy (PCT), or MBCT, was possible for 40% to 75% of participants in the group tapering the antidepressant and may show no difference in effects on relapse. 
We found low‐certainty evidence suggesting that a prompt letter and guidance on tapering sent to the GP may have no effect on the number of people who stop their antidepressant. 
We were unable to draw conclusions about withdrawal symptoms after abrupt or gradual stopping of an antidepressant, as this generally was not assessed. 
None of the studies used very slow tapering schemes beyond a few weeks, tapered liquid forms of antidepressants, or used tapering strips (to allow tapering with very low doses). 
None of the identified studies investigated stopping combined with providing supportive therapy such as online support or self‐help therapy. 
Certainty of evidence 
Overall, the certainty of evidence was low to very low. This means we have limited or little confidence in the results, and new research is likely to change our conclusions. The main reasons for this assessment of evidence certainty were that trials did not distinguish between symptoms of relapse of depression and symptoms of withdrawal. Also, most studies used no tapering or very ""rapid"" tapering schedules (four weeks or less), and nearly all studies included people with recurrent depression (more than two episodes). 
Conclusions 
We found few studies that examined stopping long‐term antidepressants. We are uncertain if the approaches for stopping long‐term antidepressants studied to date are effective and safe in people with recurrent depression. People should discuss with their doctor when they want to stop their antidepressant. 
Future studies should include people in primary care with only one or no earlier episodes of depression, older people, and people taking antidepressants for anxiety. Studies should taper antidepressants slowly while taking care to distinguish withdrawal symptoms from relapse.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological cause of disability in young adults. Off‐label rituximab for MS is used in most countries surveyed by the International Federation of MS, including high‐income countries where on‐label disease‐modifying treatments (DMTs) are available.  
Objectives
To assess beneficial and adverse effects of rituximab as 'first choice' and as 'switching' for adults with MS. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and trial registers for completed and ongoing studies on 31 January 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled non‐randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) comparing rituximab with placebo or another DMT for adults with MS. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We used the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias. We rated the certainty of evidence using GRADE for: disability worsening, relapse, serious adverse events (SAEs), health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), common infections, cancer, and mortality. We conducted separate analyses for rituximab as 'first choice' or as 'switching', relapsing or progressive MS, comparison versus placebo or another DMT, and RCTs or NRSIs. 
Main results
We included 15 studies (5 RCTs, 10 NRSIs) with 16,429 participants of whom 13,143 were relapsing MS and 3286 progressive MS. The studies were one to two years long and compared rituximab as 'first choice' with placebo (1 RCT) or other DMTs (1 NRSI), rituximab as 'switching' against placebo (2 RCTs) or other DMTs (2 RCTs, 9 NRSIs). The studies were conducted worldwide; most originated from high‐income countries, six from the Swedish MS register. Pharmaceutical companies funded two studies. We identified 14 ongoing studies. 
Rituximab as 'first choice' for relapsing MS 
Rituximab versus placebo: no studies met eligibility criteria for this comparison.
Rituximab versus other DMTs: one NRSI compared rituximab with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate, dimethyl fumarate, natalizumab, or fingolimod in active relapsing MS at 24 months' follow‐up. Rituximab likely results in a large reduction in relapses compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (hazard ratio (HR) 0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.39; 335 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Rituximab may reduce relapses compared with dimethyl fumarate (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.00; 206 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and natalizumab (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.00; 170 participants; low‐certainty evidence). It may make little or no difference on relapse compared with fingolimod (HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.69; 137 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The study reported no deaths over 24 months. The study did not measure disability worsening, SAEs, HRQoL, and common infections. 
Rituximab as 'first choice' for progressive MS 
One RCT compared rituximab with placebo in primary progressive MS at 24 months' follow‐up. Rituximab likely results in little to no difference in the number of participants who have disability worsening compared with placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.71, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.11; 439 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Rituximab may result in little to no difference in recurrence of relapses (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.99; 439 participants; low‐certainty evidence), SAEs (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.20; 439 participants; low‐certainty evidence), common infections (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.73; 439 participants; low‐certainty evidence), cancer (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.07 to 3.59; 439 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and mortality (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.77; 439 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The study did not measure HRQoL. 
Rituximab versus other DMTs: no studies met eligibility criteria for this comparison.
Rituximab as 'switching' for relapsing MS  
One RCT compared rituximab with placebo in relapsing MS at 12 months' follow‐up. Rituximab may decrease recurrence of relapses compared with placebo (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.93; 104 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of rituximab relative to placebo on SAEs (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.92; 104 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), common infections (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.24; 104 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), cancer (OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.06 to 39.15; 104 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), and mortality (OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.06 to 39.15; 104 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The study did not measure disability worsening and HRQoL.  
Five NRSIs compared rituximab with other DMTs in relapsing MS at 24 months' follow‐up. The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of rituximab relative to interferon beta or glatiramer acetate on disability worsening (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.42; 1 NRSI, 853 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Rituximab likely results in a large reduction in relapses compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.49; 1 NRSI, 1383 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); and fingolimod (HR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.32; 1 NRSI, 256 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of rituximab relative to natalizumab on relapses (HR 1.0, 95% CI 0.2 to 5.0; 1 NRSI, 153 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Rituximab likely increases slightly common infections compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.62; 1 NRSI, 5477 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); and compared with natalizumab (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.32; 2 NRSIs, 5001 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Rituximab may increase slightly common infections compared with fingolimod (OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.77; 3 NRSIs, 5187 participants; low‐certainty evidence). It may make little or no difference compared with ocrelizumab (OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.40; 1 NRSI, 472 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of rituximab on mortality compared with fingolimod (OR 5.59, 95% CI 0.22 to 139.89; 1 NRSI, 136 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and natalizumab (OR 6.66, 95% CI 0.27 to 166.58; 1 NRSI, 153 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The included studies did not measure SAEs, HRQoL, and cancer. 
Authors' conclusions
For preventing relapses in relapsing MS, rituximab as 'first choice' and as 'switching' may compare favourably with a wide range of approved DMTs. A protective effect of rituximab against disability worsening is uncertain. There is limited information to determine the effect of rituximab for progressive MS.  
The evidence is uncertain about the effect of rituximab on SAEs. They are relatively rare in people with MS, thus difficult to study, and they were not well reported in studies. There is an increased risk of common infections with rituximab, but absolute risk is small.  
Rituximab is widely used as off‐label treatment in people with MS; however, randomised evidence is weak. In the absence of randomised evidence, remaining uncertainties on beneficial and adverse effects of rituximab for MS might be clarified by making real‐world data available. 
","Here is the Plain Language Summary of the biomedical study:

### **Plain Title**

Does the drug rituximab help people with multiple sclerosis (MS)?

### **Rationale**

Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is a disease that affects the brain and nerves. It can make it hard to walk, see, or think clearly. MS is a common reason for disability in young adults.

There are two main types of MS. In one type, called relapsing MS, people have attacks, also called relapses. During an attack, symptoms get worse. In the other type, called progressive MS, the disability gets worse slowly over time.

A drug called rituximab is often used to treat MS. But the drug was not first approved for this use. This is called “off-label” use. Doctors want to know if this drug really helps people with MS and if it is safe.

Researchers did this study to look at all the past research on rituximab for MS. They wanted to find out if rituximab works well as a first drug for MS. They also wanted to know if it helps people who switch to it from other MS drugs.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results from 15 older studies. This is called a review. It helps to bring all the information together in one place.

The studies included a total of about 16,500 adults with MS. Most of these people had the relapsing type of MS. A smaller number of people had the progressive type of MS.

The studies compared rituximab to other treatments. Some people got rituximab. Others got a fake treatment, called a placebo. A placebo has no medicine in it. In other studies, people who took rituximab were compared to people who took other approved drugs for MS.

The studies that the researchers looked at lasted for one to two years.

### **Results**

Here is what the researchers found when they looked at all the studies.

**For people with relapsing MS (the type with attacks):**
*   Rituximab seemed to work well to prevent attacks.
*   When used as a first drug, people taking rituximab had a lot fewer attacks than people taking some other MS drugs.
*   When people switched to rituximab from another drug, they also had a lot fewer attacks.

**For people with progressive MS (the type that gets worse over time):**
*   Rituximab did not seem to help much.
*   In one study, the drug did not seem to slow down how fast people’s disability got worse when compared to a fake treatment.

**Side effects and safety:**
*   People who took rituximab had a slightly higher chance of getting common infections, like a cold. But the total risk of this was small.
*   The researchers did not have enough information to know about serious side effects. They could not be sure if rituximab caused serious health problems, cancer, or death.

**What the researchers concluded:**
The researchers who did this review think that rituximab helps prevent attacks in people with relapsing MS. However, they are not sure if the drug can stop disability from getting worse in either type of MS.

More research is needed to be sure about all the good and bad effects of rituximab. The researchers said that better studies would help us understand how to best use this drug for people with MS.","Rituximab for people with multiple sclerosis
Key messages 
– Rituximab may offer moderate‐to‐large benefit against a range of other medicines in preventing relapses in relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). Compared with no medicines, the desirable effects would be greater. 
– There is limited information to determine the effect of rituximab for preventing disability worsening in all forms of MS.  
– Serious harmful effects are relatively rare in people with MS making them difficult to study, and they were also not well reported in studies. 
What is the issue? 
Rituximab is a medicine administered by intravenous (by a vein) infusion that can suppress certain immune cells. The immune system fights infections and consists of many immune cells; it is affected in MS. 
Rituximab is currently used in many low‐ to middle‐income countries that have major barriers for accessing approved medicines for MS. However, rituximab is not always reimbursed by health systems because it is not licensed for MS by marketing authorities.  
Rituximab is considered a feasible treatment option as it is considered a highly effective treatment (similar to other approved medicines used to treat MS) but has considerably lower cost and less frequent dosing. Treatment with rituximab requires specialist care and infusion facilities, but other approved medicines do too. 
What did we want to find out? 
We aimed to investigate the beneficial and unwanted effects of rituximab for people with MS, when is used as a 'first choice' or as 'switching' (in other words, used when other medicines do not work well or become contraindicated). 
We wanted to find out if rituximab was better than other medicines to prevent disability worsening and recurrence of relapse, and to improve well‐being. 
We also wanted to find out if rituximab was associated with any unwanted or harmful effects, for example, serious harmful effects, common infections, cancer, and mortality (death). 
What did we do?  
We searched for studies that investigated rituximab compared with all other approved medicines for MS. We searched the literature up to January 2021. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and quality. 
What did we find?  
We found 15 studies that involved about 16,000 people with MS and lasted one or two years. The biggest study was of 6421 people and the smallest study was of 27 people. The studies were conducted worldwide; most originated from high‐income countries, six from the Swedish MS register. Pharmaceutical companies funded two included studies. 
Main results 
Rituximab as a first choice treatment in relapsing MS: 
– likely results in a large reduction in the number of people who have relapses compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (evidence from one study in 335 people); 
– may reduce the number of people who have relapses compared with dimethyl fumarate and natalizumab, but the evidence is uncertain (evidence from one study). 
There was no usable information on disability worsening, well‐being, and serious harmful effects. 
Rituximab as a first choice treatment in progressive MS: 
– likely results in little to no difference in the number of participants who have disability worsening over 24 months compared with pretend treatment (evidence from one study of 439 people); 
– the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of rituximab on well‐being and serious harmful effects. 
Rituximab as 'switching' for relapsing MS: 
– likely results in a large reduction in the number of people who have relapses compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (evidence from one study of 1383 people), and fingolimod (evidence from one study of 256 people). The evidence is very uncertain on the comparison of rituximab with natalizumab; 
– the evidence is very uncertain on disability worsening;
– likely increases slightly the number of people who have common infections compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (evidence from one study of 5477 people), and natalizumab (evidence from two studies of 5001 people). The evidence is uncertain for the comparisons of rituximab with fingolimod and ocrelizumab. 
There was no usable information on well‐being and serious harmful effects.
Rituximab as 'switching' for progressive MS 
Only three small studies investigated rituximab in secondary progressive MS. The evidence is uncertain about the effect of rituximab on disability worsening, well‐being, and serious harmful effects. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
– Limited confidence about the effect of rituximab on disability worsening in all forms of MS. 
– Limited information to determine the effect of rituximab for progressive forms of MS. 
– Studies were short with a median duration of 24 months.
How up to date is the evidence? 
This review is up to day to 31 January 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013367.pub2,"Background
Humour‐based interventions are defined as any intervention that promotes health and wellness by stimulating a playful discovery, expression, or appreciation of the absurdity or incongruity of life's situations. Humour‐based interventions can be implemented in different settings, including hospitals, nursing homes and day care centres. They have been posed as an adjunct to usual care for people with schizophrenia, but a summary of the evidence is lacking. 
Objectives
To examine the effects of humour‐based interventions as an add‐on intervention to standard care for people with schizophrenia. 
Search methods
On 31 July 2019 and 10 February 2021 we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's study‐based register of trials, which is based on CENTRAL, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.Gov, Embase, ISRCTN, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and WHO ICTRP. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials comparing humour‐based interventions with active controls, other psychological interventions, or standard care for people with schizophrenia. We excluded studies fulfilling our prespecified selection criteria but without useable data from further quantitative synthesis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data and appraised study quality, following the guidance from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. For binary outcomes we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes we calculated the mean differences (MDs) and their 95% CIs. We assessed risks of bias for included studies and created summary of findings tables using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included three studies in this review for qualitative synthesis, although one study did not report any relevant outcomes. We therefore include two studies (n = 96) in our quantitative synthesis. No data were available on the following prespecified primary outcomes: clinically‐important change in general mental state, clinically‐important change in negative symptoms, clinically‐important change in overall quality of life, and adverse effects. As compared with active control, humour‐based interventions may not improve the average endpoint score of a general mental state scale (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score: MD −1.70, 95% CI −17.01 to 13.61; 1 study, 30 participants; very low certainty of evidence); positive symptoms (PANSS positive symptom score: MD 0.00, 95% CI −2.58 to 2.58; 1 study, 30 participants; low certainty of evidence), negative symptoms (PANSS negative symptom score: MD −0.70, 95% CI −4.22 to 2.82; 1 study, 30 participants; very low certainty of evidence) and anxiety (State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI): MD −2.60, 95% CI −5.76 to 0.56; 1 study, 30 participants; low certainty of evidence). Due to the small sample size, we remain uncertain about the effect of humour‐based interventions on leaving the study early as compared with active control (no event, 1 study, 30 participants; very low certainty of evidence). On the other hand, humour‐based interventions may reduce depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory (BDI): MD −6.20, 95% CI −12.08 to −0.32; 1 study, 30 participants; low certainty of evidence). Compared with standard care, humour‐based interventions may not improve  depressive symptoms (BDI second edition: MD 0.80, 95% CI −2.64 to 4.24; 1 study, 59 participants; low certainty of evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of humour‐based interventions on leaving the study early for any reason compared with standard care (risk ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.80; 1 study, 66 participants; very low certainty of evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
We are currently uncertain whether the evidence supports the use of humour‐based interventions in people with schizophrenia. Future research with rigorous and transparent methodology investigating clinically important outcomes is warranted.

Can Laughter and Humor Help People with Schizophrenia? A Review of Past Studies

**Rationale**

*   **What is humor therapy?**
    Humor therapy is a treatment that uses laughter and fun to help people. It helps them find and appreciate the funny or silly parts of life. The goal is to improve a person's health and make them feel better. This kind of therapy can happen in many places, like hospitals or community centers.

*   **What is schizophrenia?**
    Schizophrenia is a serious mental health condition. It affects how a person thinks, feels, and acts. Living with schizophrenia can be very hard for patients and their families. People with this condition receive what is called ""standard care."" This is the usual mix of medicines and talk therapy that doctors provide.

*   **Why did we do this study?**
    Researchers have thought that humor therapy might be a good ""add-on"" treatment. This means it could be used together with standard care to help people more. But it was not clear if this idea was supported by science. No one had gathered all the research in one place to see what it said. We wanted to find and review all the past studies on this topic. Our main goal was to see if the evidence shows that humor therapy helps people with schizophrenia.

**Trial Design**

*   **How did we look for answers?**
    We did not work with new patients for this research. Instead, we did a special kind of study called a review. This means we searched for all the scientific studies that had already been done on this topic. We looked in many different places online to find them.

*   **What kind of studies did we look for?**
    We only included the best type of studies, called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, people are put into different groups by chance, like flipping a coin. This helps make the results fair. We looked for studies that compared people with schizophrenia who received humor therapy to those who did not.

    The people who got humor therapy also continued their standard care. The people in the other groups either got their standard care alone or standard care plus a different kind of therapy. This helped us see if humor therapy made a real difference.

*   **What studies did we find?**
    Our search found three studies that seemed to fit. However, one study did not report its results in a way we could use. So, we could only look at the results from two small studies. Together, these two studies included 96 people. Because there were so few people in the studies, it is hard to be sure about the results.

**Results**

*   **What were the main results of our review?**
    After looking at the two small studies, we found that the evidence is not clear. We are still uncertain if humor therapy is a helpful treatment for people with schizophrenia. The studies were too small to give us strong answers.

*   **Did humor therapy help with symptoms?**
    The studies measured symptoms in several ways. They checked if humor therapy helped a person’s overall mental health. They also checked for specific symptoms of schizophrenia. The results showed that humor therapy may not have improved these things. It also did not seem to reduce feelings of worry.

*   **Did humor therapy help with feelings of sadness?**
    One of the two studies did find a possible benefit. It showed that people who got humor therapy felt less sad afterward. This is a good sign. However, the other study did not find this same benefit. Because the results were different, we cannot be sure if humor therapy truly helps with sadness.

*   **What else did we look at?**
    We also wanted to know if humor therapy had any bad effects, but the studies did not report any. We also checked if people in the humor therapy groups were more likely to finish the study. The information was not clear enough to answer this question either.

*   **What do these results mean?**
    Right now, we cannot say for sure if humor therapy helps people with schizophrenia. There is not enough good research to support its use. The studies we have are too small, and their results are not strong enough.

    We need more and better research to get a clear answer. Future studies should include more people. They also need to be designed very carefully. This will help doctors and patients know if humor therapy should be added to standard care for schizophrenia.","Humour‐based interventions for people with schizophrenia
Review question 
Are humour‐based interventions effective in treating people with schizophrenia?
Background 
Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness. It is a disorder of thought, namely firm fixed false beliefs despite there being evidence to the contrary, loss of reality ties, and altered perception. These symptoms are further classified as (i) positive symptoms, such as speech without order, illusions or mistaken and persistent ideas; and (ii) negative symptoms, a lack of emotion or restricted quantity of speech; and decline in cognitive function, including attention, memory, and behavior control. The standard treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications. Treatment with humour‐based interventions, such as watching humorous movies, funny videos, or comedies, has been proposed as an add‐on treatment that promotes health and wellness by stimulating a playful discovery, expression, or appreciation of the irrationality or inconsistency of life's situations. 
Searching for evidence 
We ran an electronic search in February 2021 for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive humour‐based interventions in addition to usual care, or to receive usual care only, another psychological intervention or a control condition. We found eight records and checked them for suitability to include in our review. 
Evidence found 
Three trials met the review requirements and two low‐quality trials (total number of participants = 96) provided useable data. Compared with active control, humour‐based interventions may not improve positive symptoms and anxiety, but may improve depressive symptoms. However, when compared with standard care, humour‐based intervention may not improve the depressive symptoms. Current evidence is very limited and is of low to very low quality. We are uncertain as to whether humour‐based interventions may lead to clinically‐important improvement in mental state or quality of life in people with schizophrenia. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient research evidence to support the use of humour‐based interventions in people with schizophrenia.

10.1002-14651858.CD013186,"Background
Early accurate detection of all skin cancer types is essential to guide appropriate management and to improve morbidity and survival. Melanoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) are high‐risk skin cancers which have the potential to metastasise and ultimately lead to death, whereas basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is usually localised with potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue. Anxiety around missing early curable cases needs to be balanced against inappropriate referral and unnecessary excision of benign lesions. Computer‐assisted diagnosis (CAD) systems use artificial intelligence to analyse lesion data and arrive at a diagnosis of skin cancer. When used in unreferred settings ('primary care'), CAD may assist general practitioners (GPs) or other clinicians to more appropriately triage high‐risk lesions to secondary care. Used alongside clinical and dermoscopic suspicion of malignancy, CAD may reduce unnecessary excisions without missing melanoma cases. 
Objectives
To determine the accuracy of CAD systems for diagnosing cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants, BCC or cSCC in adults, and to compare its accuracy with that of dermoscopy. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Studies of any design that evaluated CAD alone, or in comparison with dermoscopy, in adults with lesions suspicious for melanoma or BCC or cSCC, and compared with a reference standard of either histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). We contacted authors of included studies where information related to the target condition or diagnostic threshold were missing. We estimated summary sensitivities and specificities separately by type of CAD system, using the bivariate hierarchical model. We compared CAD with dermoscopy using (a) all available CAD data (indirect comparisons), and (b) studies providing paired data for both tests (direct comparisons). We tested the contribution of human decision‐making to the accuracy of CAD diagnoses in a sensitivity analysis by removing studies that gave CAD results to clinicians to guide diagnostic decision‐making. 
Main results
We included 42 studies, 24 evaluating digital dermoscopy‐based CAD systems (Derm–CAD) in 23 study cohorts with 9602 lesions (1220 melanomas, at least 83 BCCs, 9 cSCCs), providing 32 datasets for Derm–CAD and seven for dermoscopy. Eighteen studies evaluated spectroscopy‐based CAD (Spectro–CAD) in 16 study cohorts with 6336 lesions (934 melanomas, 163 BCC, 49 cSCCs), providing 32 datasets for Spectro–CAD and six for dermoscopy. These consisted of 15 studies using multispectral imaging (MSI), two studies using electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and one study using diffuse‐reflectance spectroscopy. Studies were incompletely reported and at unclear to high risk of bias across all domains. Included studies inadequately address the review question, due to an abundance of low‐quality studies, poor reporting, and recruitment of highly selected groups of participants. 
Across all CAD systems, we found considerable variation in the hardware and software technologies used, the types of classification algorithm employed, methods used to train the algorithms, and which lesion morphological features were extracted and analysed across all CAD systems, and even between studies evaluating CAD systems. Meta–analysis found CAD systems had high sensitivity for correct identification of cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants in highly selected populations, but with low and very variable specificity, particularly for Spectro–CAD systems. Pooled data from 22 studies estimated the sensitivity of Derm–CAD for the detection of melanoma as 90.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 84.0% to 94.0%) and specificity as 74.3% (95% CI 63.6% to 82.7%). Pooled data from eight studies estimated the sensitivity of multispectral imaging CAD (MSI–CAD) as 92.9% (95% CI 83.7% to 97.1%) and specificity as 43.6% (95% CI 24.8% to 64.5%). When applied to a hypothetical population of 1000 lesions at the mean observed melanoma prevalence of 20%, Derm–CAD would miss 20 melanomas and would lead to 206 false‐positive results for melanoma. MSI–CAD would miss 14 melanomas and would lead to 451 false diagnoses for melanoma. Preliminary findings suggest CAD systems are at least as sensitive as assessment of dermoscopic images for the diagnosis of invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants. We are unable to make summary statements about the use of CAD in unreferred populations, or its accuracy in detecting keratinocyte cancers, or its use in any setting as a diagnostic aid, because of the paucity of studies. 
Authors' conclusions
In highly selected patient populations all CAD types demonstrate high sensitivity, and could prove useful as a back‐up for specialist diagnosis to assist in minimising the risk of missing melanomas. However, the evidence base is currently too poor to understand whether CAD system outputs translate to different clinical decision–making in practice. Insufficient data are available on the use of CAD in community settings, or for the detection of keratinocyte cancers. The evidence base for individual systems is too limited to draw conclusions on which might be preferred for practice. Prospective comparative studies are required that evaluate the use of already evaluated CAD systems as diagnostic aids, by comparison to face–to–face dermoscopy, and in participant populations that are representative of those in which the test would be used in practice.

Can Computers Help Doctors Find Skin Cancer? A Review of Past Studies

### **Rationale**

Skin cancer is a common health problem. Finding it early is the best way to treat it. There are different types of skin cancer. Some types, like melanoma, are very serious. They can spread to other parts of the body. Other types are less likely to spread but can still damage the skin.

Doctors want to find every skin cancer. But this can be hard. Sometimes, a normal mole or spot on the skin can look like cancer. This means doctors may remove skin spots that are not harmful. This can cause worry for patients and lead to unneeded surgeries.

This review looked at a new tool that could help. This tool is a computer system that uses artificial intelligence. This means it is a ""smart computer"" that is trained to spot signs of cancer in pictures of skin spots. Researchers wanted to know if these computer systems are good at finding skin cancer. They hoped these tools could help doctors make better choices. This could help patients get the right care and avoid unneeded procedures.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at studies that were already done. This is called a review.

The researchers searched for all studies about computer systems for finding skin cancer. They looked at studies done up to August 2016. In total, they found 42 studies to review.

These studies tested how well computer systems could spot the most common types of skin cancer in adults. The computers looked at pictures of skin spots. The researchers in this review gathered the results from all 42 studies. They wanted to see how accurate the computer systems were. They also compared the computers to a special tool doctors use called a dermoscope. A dermoscope is a handheld magnifying glass that helps doctors see skin spots more clearly.

### **Results**

The review found that the computer systems were very good at one thing. They were good at spotting serious skin cancers when they were really there. The computers did not miss many cancers.

However, the computer systems were not good at another task. They often flagged safe skin spots as being cancer. This means they made a lot of mistakes by saying a spot was cancer when it was really harmless.

Here is an example to explain this. Imagine a doctor looks at 1000 skin spots. Let's say 200 of those spots are a serious skin cancer called melanoma.
*   One type of computer system would find 180 of the 200 cancers. But it would also wrongly say that 206 safe spots were cancer.
*   Another type of computer system would find 186 of the 200 cancers. But it would wrongly flag 451 safe spots as cancer.

The early results also showed that the computer systems were at least as good as the special magnifying tool at finding serious skin cancers.

The researchers who did this review reached a few main conclusions. They said that these computer systems could be useful tools for skin doctors. They might help doctors double-check their work to make sure they do not miss a serious cancer.

However, the studies they reviewed were not of high quality. Most of the studies looked at special groups of patients, not people in a regular doctor’s office. There was not enough information to know if these computers can find the less serious types of skin cancer.

Because the computers flagged so many safe spots as cancer, they could cause unneeded worry and skin removals if used by general doctors. The researchers said that we need more and better studies. These new studies should test the computer systems in real clinics with regular patients to see if they truly help.","What is the diagnostic accuracy of computer‐assisted diagnosis techniques for the detection of skin cancer in adults? 
Why is improving the diagnosis of skin cancer important? 
There are a number of different types of skin cancer, including melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms. If it is not recognised early treatment can be delayed and this risks the melanoma spreading to other organs in the body and may eventually lead to death. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and BCC are considered less dangerous, as they are localised (less likely to spread to other parts of the body compared to melanoma). However, cSCC can spread to other parts of the body and BCC can cause disfigurement if not recognised early. Diagnosing a skin cancer when it is not actually present (a false‐positive result) might result in unnecessary surgery and other investigations and can cause stress and anxiety to the patient. Missing a diagnosis of skin cancer may result in the wrong treatment being used or lead to a delay in effective treatment. 
What is the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate computer–assisted diagnosis (CAD) is for diagnosing melanoma, BCC or cSCC. The review also compared the accuracy of two different types of CAD, and compared the accuracy of CAD with diagnosis by a doctor using a handheld illuminated microscope (a dermatoscope or ‘dermoscopy’). We included 42 studies to answer these questions. 
What was studied in the review? 
A number of tools are available to skin cancer specialists which allow a more detailed examination of the skin compared to examination by the naked eye alone. Currently a dermatoscope which magnifies the skin lesion (a mole or area of skin with an unusual appearance in comparison with the surrounding skin) using a bright light source is used by most skin cancer specialists. CAD tests are computer systems that analyse information about skin lesions obtained from a dermatoscope or other techniques that use light to describe the features of a skin lesion (spectroscopy) to produce a result indicating whether skin cancer is likely to be present. We included CAD systems that get their information from dermoscopic images of lesions (Derm–CAD), or that use data from spectroscopy. Most of the spectroscopy studies used data from multispectral imaging (MSI–CAD) and are the main focus here. When a skin cancer specialist finds a lesion is suspicious using visual examination with or without additional dermoscopy, results from CAD systems can be used alone to make a diagnosis of skin cancer (CAD–based diagnosis), or can be used by doctors in addition to their visual inspection examination of a skin lesion to help them reach a diagnosis (CAD–aided diagnosis). Researchers examined how useful CAD systems are to help diagnose skin cancers in addition to visual inspection and dermoscopy. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review included 42 studies looking at CAD systems for the diagnosis of melanoma. There was not enough evidence to determine the accuracy of CAD systems for the diagnosis of BCC (3 studies) or cSCC (1 study). 
Derm‐CAD results for diagnosis of melanoma  
The main results for Derm‐CAD are based on 22 studies including 8992 lesions.
Applied to a group of 1000 skin lesions, of which 200 (20%) are given a final diagnosis* of melanoma, the results suggest that: 
‐ An estimated 386 people will have a Derm–CAD result suggesting that a melanoma is present, and of these 206 (53%) will not actually have a melanoma (false‐positive result) 
‐ Of the 614 people with a Derm–CAD result indicating that no melanoma is present, 20 (3%) will in fact actually have a melanoma (false‐negative result) 
There was no evidence to suggest that dermoscopy or Derm–CAD was different in its ability to detect or rule out melanoma. 
MSI‐CAD results for diagnosis of melanoma  
The main results for MSI–CAD are based on eight studies including 2401 lesions. In a group of 1000 people, of whom 200 (20%) actually do have melanoma*, then: 
‐ An estimated 637 people will have an MSI–CAD result suggesting that a melanoma is present, and of these 451 (71%) will not actually have a melanoma (false‐positive result) 
‐ Of the 363 people with an MSI–CAD result indicating that no melanoma is present, 14 (4%) will in fact have a melanoma (false‐negative result) 
MSI–CAD detects more melanomas, but possibly produces more false‐positive results (an increase in unnecessary surgery). 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
Incomplete reporting of studies made it difficult for us to judge how reliable they were. Many studies had important limitations. Some studies only included particular types of skin lesions or excluded lesions that were considered difficult to diagnose. Importantly, most of the studies only included skin lesions with a biopsy result, which means that only a sample of lesions that would be seen by a doctor in practice were included. These characteristics may result in CAD systems appearing more or less accurate than they actually are. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies were largely conducted in Europe (29, 69%) and North America (8, 19%). Mean age (reported in 6/42 studies) ranged from 32 to 49 years for melanoma. The percentage of people with a final diagnosis of melanoma ranged from 1% to 52%. It was not always possible to tell whether suspicion of skin cancer in study participants was based on clinical examination alone, or both clinical and dermoscopic examinations. Almost all studies were done in people with skin lesions who were seen at specialist clinics rather than by doctors in primary care. 
What are the implications of this review? 
CAD systems appear to be accurate for identification of melanomas in skin lesions that have already been selected for excision on the basis of clinical examination (visual inspection and dermoscopy). It is possible that some CAD systems identify more melanomas than doctors using dermoscopy images. However, CAD systems also produced far more false‐positive diagnoses than dermoscopy, and could lead to considerable increases in unnecessary surgery. The performance of CAD systems for detecting BCC and cSCC skin cancers is unclear. More studies are needed to evaluate the use of CAD by doctors for the diagnosis of skin cancer in comparison to face‐to‐face diagnosis using dermoscopy, both in primary care and in specialist skin cancer clinics. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies, biopsy, clinical follow up, or specialist clinician diagnosis were the reference standards (means of establishing the final diagnosis). 
"
10.1002-14651858.CD013193,"Background
Early accurate detection of all skin cancer types is essential to guide appropriate management and to improve morbidity and survival. Melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are high‐risk skin cancers which have the potential to metastasise and ultimately lead to death, whereas basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is usually localised with potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue. Anxiety around missing early curable cases needs to be balanced against inappropriate referral and unnecessary excision of benign lesions. Teledermatology provides a way for generalist clinicians to access the opinion of a specialist dermatologist for skin lesions that they consider to be suspicious without referring the patients through the normal referral pathway. Teledermatology consultations can be 'store‐and‐forward' with electronic digital images of a lesion sent to a dermatologist for review at a later time, or can be live and interactive consultations using videoconferencing to connect the patient, referrer and dermatologist in real time. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of teledermatology for the detection of any skin cancer (melanoma, BCC or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC)) in adults, and to compare its accuracy with that of in‐person diagnosis. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, CPCI, Zetoc, Science Citation Index, US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Studies evaluating skin cancer diagnosis for teledermatology alone, or in comparison with face‐to‐face diagnosis by a specialist clinician, compared with a reference standard of histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up and expert opinion. We also included studies evaluating the referral accuracy of teledermatology compared with a reference standard of face‐to‐face diagnosis by a specialist clinician. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). We contacted authors of included studies where there were information related to the target condition of any skin cancer missing. Data permitting, we estimated summary sensitivities and specificities using the bivariate hierarchical model. Due to the scarcity of data, we undertook no covariate investigations for this review. For illustrative purposes, we plotted estimates of sensitivity and specificity on coupled forest plots for diagnostic threshold and target condition under consideration. 
Main results
The review included 22 studies reporting diagnostic accuracy data for 4057 lesions and 879 malignant cases (16 studies) and referral accuracy data for reported data for 1449 lesions and 270 'positive' cases as determined by the reference standard face‐to‐face decision (six studies). Methodological quality was variable with poor reporting hindering assessment. The overall risk of bias was high or unclear for participant selection, reference standard, and participant flow and timing in at least half of all studies; the majority were at low risk of bias for the index test. The applicability of study findings were of high or unclear concern for most studies in all domains assessed due to the recruitment of participants from secondary care settings or specialist clinics rather than from primary or community‐based settings in which teledermatology is more likely to be used and due to the acquisition of lesion images by dermatologists or in specialist imaging units rather than by primary care clinicians. 
Seven studies provided data for the primary target condition of any skin cancer (1588 lesions and 638 malignancies). For the correct diagnosis of lesions as malignant using photographic images, summary sensitivity was 94.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 90.1% to 97.4%) and summary specificity was 84.3% (95% CI 48.5% to 96.8%) (from four studies). Individual study estimates using dermoscopic images or a combination of photographic and dermoscopic images generally suggested similarly high sensitivities with highly variable specificities. Limited comparative data suggested similar diagnostic accuracy between teledermatology assessment and in‐person diagnosis by a dermatologist; however, data were too scarce to draw firm conclusions. For the detection of invasive melanoma or atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants both sensitivities and specificities were more variable. Sensitivities ranged from 59% (95% CI 42% to 74%) to 100% (95% CI 48% to 100%) and specificities from 30% (95% CI 22% to 40%) to 100% (95% CI 93% to 100%), with reported diagnostic thresholds including the correct diagnosis of melanoma, classification of lesions as 'atypical' or 'typical, and the decision to refer or to excise a lesion. 
Referral accuracy data comparing teledermatology against a face‐to‐face reference standard suggested good agreement for lesions considered to require some positive action by face‐to‐face assessment (sensitivities of over 90%). For lesions considered of less concern when assessed face‐to‐face (e.g. for lesions not recommended for excision or referral), agreement was more variable with teledermatology specificities ranging from 57% (95% CI 39% to 73%) to 100% (95% CI 86% to 100%), suggesting that remote assessment is more likely recommend excision, referral or follow‐up compared to in‐person decisions. 
Authors' conclusions
Studies were generally small and heterogeneous and methodological quality was difficult to judge due to poor reporting. Bearing in mind concerns regarding the applicability of study participants and of lesion image acquisition in specialist settings, our results suggest that teledermatology can correctly identify the majority of malignant lesions. Using a more widely defined threshold to identify 'possibly' malignant cases or lesions that should be considered for excision is likely to appropriately triage those lesions requiring face‐to‐face assessment by a specialist. Despite the increasing use of teledermatology on an international level, the evidence base to support its ability to accurately diagnose lesions and to triage lesions from primary to secondary care is lacking and further prospective and pragmatic evaluation is needed.

Can Doctors Find Skin Cancer by Looking at Pictures?

### **Rationale**

Skin cancer is a common health problem. Finding it early is the best way to treat it. There are a few types of skin cancer. Some types, like melanoma, are very serious. They can spread to other parts of the body. Other types are less serious but can still harm the skin around them.

Doctors want to find skin cancer early. But it can be hard to tell if a skin spot is cancer or just a harmless mole. This can cause worry. It can also lead to extra doctor visits and skin tests that are not needed.

One idea to help is called teledermatology. This is when your family doctor takes a picture of a skin spot. They then send the picture to a skin specialist, called a dermatologist. The specialist can look at the picture and give their opinion from far away. This could help people get an expert opinion faster.

This study looked at past research to see if teledermatology is a good way to find skin cancer. Researchers wanted to know if looking at pictures is as accurate as seeing a doctor in person.

### **Trial Design**

This was a review study. This means the researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they gathered and looked at studies that were already done by other people. They wanted to combine the results from many studies to get a better answer.

The researchers searched for studies about teledermatology and skin cancer. They looked at studies published up to August 2016.

They found 22 studies that fit what they were looking for. These studies included thousands of adults and their skin spots. In the studies, doctors used teledermatology to check the skin spots. To know for sure if a spot was cancer, a small piece of the skin was looked at under a microscope. This is the best way to know if a spot is cancer.

### **Results**

The review found that teledermatology is good at finding skin cancer. When doctors used photos to check for any type of skin cancer, they correctly found about 95 out of 100 cancers. This means the method is very unlikely to miss a cancer.

However, the method was not as good at telling which skin spots were harmless. It sometimes flagged a harmless spot as something to worry about. This could mean that some people are sent to a specialist even if their skin spot is not cancer.

For melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer, the results were mixed. Some studies found that teledermatology worked well to find it, but others did not.

The study also looked at how well teledermatology worked for deciding who needs to see a specialist. The results showed that it was very good at this. Almost everyone who needed to see a specialist in person was correctly identified using the photos.

The researchers who did this review concluded that teledermatology seems like a useful tool. It can help find most skin cancers. But they also pointed out that the studies they looked at were small. More and better research is needed to know for sure how well teledermatology works in a normal family doctor’s office.","What is the diagnostic accuracy of teledermatology for the diagnosis of skin cancer in adults? 
Why is improving the diagnosis of skin cancer important? 
There are different types of skin cancer. Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms and it is important to identify it early so that it can be removed. If it is not recognised when first brought to the attention of doctors (also known as a false‐negative test result) treatment can be delayed resulting in the melanoma spreading to other organs in the body and possibly causing early death. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) are usually localised skin cancers, although cSCC can spread to other parts of the body and BCC can cause disfigurement if not recognised early. Calling something a skin cancer when it is not really a skin cancer (a false‐positive result) may result in unnecessary surgery and other investigations that can cause stress and worry to the patient. Making the correct diagnosis is important. Mistaking one skin cancer for another can lead to the wrong treatment being used or lead to a delay in effective treatment. 
What is the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether teledermatology is accurate enough to identify which people with skin lesions need to be referred to see a specialist dermatologist (a doctor concerned with disease of the skin) and who can be safely reassured that their lesion (damage or change of the skin) is not malignant. We included 22 studies to answer this question. 
What was studied in the review? 
Teledermatology means sending pictures of skin lesions or rashes to a specialist for advice on diagnosis or management. It is a way for primary care doctors (general practitioners (GPs)) to get an opinion from a specialist dermatologist without having to refer patients through the normal referral pathway. Teledermatology can involve sending photographs or magnified images of a skin lesion taken with a special camera (dermatoscope) to a skin specialist to look at or it might involve immediate discussion about a skin lesion between a GP and a skin specialist using videoconferencing. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review included 22 studies, 16 studies comparing teledermatology diagnoses to the final lesion diagnoses (diagnostic accuracy) for 4057 lesions and 879 malignant cases and five studies comparing teledermatology decisions to the decisions that would be made with the patient present (referral accuracy) for 1449 lesions and 270 'positive' cases. 
The studies were very different from each other in terms of the types of people with suspicious skin cancer lesions included and the type of teledermatology used. A single reliable estimate of the accuracy of teledermatology could not be made. For the correct diagnosis of a lesion to be a skin cancer, data suggested that less than 7% of malignant skin lesions were missed by teledermatology. Study results were too variable to tell us how many people would be referred unnecessarily for a specialist dermatology appointment following a teledermatology consultation. Without access to teledermatology services however, most of the lesions included in these studies would likely be referred to a dermatologist. 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
In the included studies, the final diagnosis of skin cancer was made by lesion biopsy (taking a small sample of the lesion so it could be examined under a microscope) and the absence of skin cancer was confirmed by biopsy or by follow‐up over time to make sure the skin lesion remained negative for melanoma. This is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether people really had skin cancer. In a few studies, a diagnosis of no skin cancer was made by a skin specialist rather than biopsy. This is less likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether people really had skin cancer*. Poor reporting of what was done in the study made it difficult for us to say how reliable the study results are. Selecting some patients from specialist clinics instead of primary care along with different ways of doing teledermatology were common problems. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies were conducted in: Europe (64%), North America (18%), South America (9%) or Oceania (9%). The average age of people who were studied was 52 years; however, several studies included at least some people under the age of 16 years. The percentage of people with skin cancer ranged between 2% and 88% with an average of 30%, which is much higher than would be observed in a primary care setting in the UK. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Teledermatology is likely to be a good way of helping GPs to decide which skin lesions need to be seen by a skin specialist. Our review suggests that using magnified images, in addition to photographs of the lesion, improves accuracy. More research is needed to establish the best way of providing teledermatology services. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies, biopsy, clinical follow‐up or specialist clinician diagnosis were the reference comparisons.

10.1002-14651858.CD013479,"Background
Uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in many countries, although the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines given as a three‐dose schedule are effective in the prevention of precancerous lesions of the cervix in women. Simpler immunisation schedules, such as those with fewer doses, might reduce barriers to vaccination, as may programmes that include males. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity, and harms of different dose schedules and different types of HPV vaccines in females and males. 
Search methods
We conducted electronic searches on 27 September 2018 in Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in the Cochrane Library), and Ovid Embase. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov (both 27 September 2018), vaccine manufacturer websites, and checked reference lists from an index of HPV studies and other relevant systematic reviews. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with no language restriction. We considered studies if they enrolled HIV‐negative males or females aged 9 to 26 years, or HIV‐positive males or females of any age. 
Data collection and analysis
We used methods recommended by Cochrane. We use the term 'control' to refer to comparator products containing an adjuvant or active vaccine and 'placebo' to refer to products that contain no adjuvant or active vaccine. Most primary outcomes in this review were clinical outcomes. However, for comparisons comparing dose schedules, the included RCTs were designed to measure antibody responses (i.e. immunogenicity) as the primary outcome, rather than clinical outcomes, since it is unethical to collect cervical samples from girls under 16 years of age. We analysed immunogenicity outcomes (i.e. geometric mean titres) with ratios of means, clinical outcomes (e.g. cancer and intraepithelial neoplasia) with risk ratios or rate ratios and, for serious adverse events and deaths, we calculated odds ratios. We rated the certainty of evidence with GRADE. 
Main results
We included 20 RCTs with 31,940 participants. The length of follow‐up in the included studies ranged from seven months to five years. 
Two doses versus three doses of HPV vaccine in 9‐ to 15‐year‐old females 
Antibody responses after two‐dose and three‐dose HPV vaccine schedules were similar after up to five years of follow‐up (4 RCTs, moderate‐ to high‐certainty evidence). No RCTs collected clinical outcome data. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing dose schedules was of very low‐certainty owing to imprecision and indirectness (three doses 35/1159; two doses 36/1158; 4 RCTs). One death was reported in the three‐dose group (1/898) and none in the two‐dose group (0/899) (low‐certainty evidence). 
Interval between doses of HPV vaccine in 9‐ to 14‐year‐old females and males 
Antibody responses were stronger with a longer interval (6 or 12 months) between the first two doses of HPV vaccine than a shorter interval (2 or 6 months) at up to three years of follow‐up (4 RCTs, moderate‐ to high‐certainty evidence). No RCTs collected data about clinical outcomes. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing intervals was of very low‐certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness. No deaths were reported in any of the studies (0/1898, 3 RCTs, low‐certainty evidence). 
HPV vaccination of 10‐ to 26‐year‐old males 
In one RCT there was moderate‐certainty evidence that quadrivalent HPV vaccine, compared with control, reduced the incidence of external genital lesions (control 36 per 3081 person‐years; quadrivalent 6 per 3173 person‐years; rate ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.38; 6254 person‐years) and anogenital warts (control 28 per 2814 person‐years; quadrivalent 3 per 2831 person‐years; rate ratio 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.38; 5645 person‐years). The quadrivalent vaccine resulted in more injection‐site adverse events, such as pain or redness, than control (537 versus 601 per 1000; risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.18, 3895 participants, high‐certainty evidence). There was very low‐certainty evidence from two RCTs about serious adverse events with quadrivalent vaccine (control 12/2588; quadrivalent 8/2574), and about deaths (control 11/2591; quadrivalent 3/2582), owing to imprecision and indirectness. 
Nonavalent versus quadrivalent vaccine in 9‐ to 26‐year‐old females and males 
Three RCTs were included; one in females aged 9‐ to 15‐years (n = 600), one in females aged 16‐ to 26‐years (n = 14,215), and one in males aged 16‐ to 26‐years (n = 500). The RCT in 16‐ to 26‐year‐old females reported clinical outcomes. There was little to no difference in the incidence of the combined outcome of high‐grade cervical epithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, or cervical cancer between the HPV vaccines (quadrivalent 325/6882, nonavalent 326/6871; OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16; 13,753 participants; high‐certainty evidence). The other two RCTs did not collect data about clinical outcomes. There were slightly more local adverse events with the nonavalent vaccine (905 per 1000) than the quadrivalent vaccine (846 per 1000) (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.08; 3 RCTs, 15,863 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Comparative evidence about serious adverse events in the three RCTs (nonavalent 243/8234, quadrivalent 192/7629; OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.61) was of low certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness. 
HPV vaccination for people living with HIV 
Seven RCTs reported on HPV vaccines in people with HIV, with two small trials that collected data about clinical outcomes. Antibody responses were higher following vaccination with either bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine than with control, and these responses could be demonstrated to have been maintained for up to 24 months in children living with HIV (low‐certainty evidence). The evidence about clinical outcomes and harms for HPV vaccines in people with HIV is very uncertain (low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence), owing to imprecision and indirectness. 
Authors' conclusions
The immunogenicity of two‐dose and three‐dose HPV vaccine schedules, measured using antibody responses in young females, is comparable. The quadrivalent vaccine probably reduces external genital lesions and anogenital warts in males compared with control. The nonavalent and quadrivalent vaccines offer similar protection against a combined outcome of cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions or cancer. In people living with HIV, both the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines result in high antibody responses. For all comparisons of alternative HPV vaccine schedules, the certainty of the body of evidence about serious adverse events reported during the study periods was low or very low, either because the number of events was low, or the evidence was indirect, or both. Post‐marketing surveillance is needed to continue monitoring harms that might be associated with HPV vaccines in the population, and this evidence will be incorporated in future updates of this review. Long‐term observational studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of reduced‐dose schedules against HPV‐related cancer endpoints, and whether adopting these schedules improves vaccine coverage rates.

Comparing Different Schedules for the HPV Vaccine

**Rationale**

A common virus called HPV can cause certain types of cancer. One of these cancers is cancer of the cervix. The cervix is the lower part of a woman's womb.

There is a vaccine that can stop people from getting the HPV virus. The normal plan for this vaccine is three shots. But getting all three shots can be hard for some people. Because of this, many people do not finish their HPV shots.

Researchers wanted to know if a simpler plan with fewer shots would work just as well. A simpler plan could help more people get the vaccine. Researchers also wanted to see how well the vaccine works for boys and for people living with HIV.

**Trial Design**

This was not a new study. Instead, researchers looked at the results of 20 past studies. In total, these studies included about 32,000 people.

The people in the studies were boys and girls, and men and women. Most were between 9 and 26 years old. Some of the studies also included people with HIV.

In each study, people were put into different groups by chance. This helps make the results fair. The studies compared different vaccine plans. Some people got two shots. Others got three shots. Some groups had a longer wait time between shots than others. The studies also compared different types of HPV vaccines. Some people got a pretend shot with no vaccine in it. The studies followed people for up to 5 years to see what happened.

**Results**

Here is what the researchers found when they looked at all the studies together.

**Two shots versus three shots**
For young girls, getting two shots of the HPV vaccine worked as well as getting three shots. Both plans helped the body build a strong defense against the HPV virus. The studies did not check for cancer in these young girls. It is not right to test young girls for this.

**The time between shots**
A longer wait time between the first and second shots worked better. When there were 6 to 12 months between shots, the body had a stronger defense against the virus. This was better than a shorter wait of only 2 months.

**The vaccine for boys**
The vaccine helped protect boys from getting sores and warts on their private parts. Boys who got the vaccine had more side effects like pain or redness where they got the shot. This was compared to boys who got a shot with no vaccine in it.

**A newer vaccine versus an older vaccine**
Researchers also compared a newer HPV vaccine to an older one. Both vaccines worked equally well. They both helped stop spots that can turn into cancer. The newer vaccine caused a few more side effects right at the spot of the shot.

**The vaccine for people with HIV**
The HPV vaccine also worked well for people who have HIV. The vaccine helped their bodies build a strong defense against the HPV virus.

**What the researchers learned**
The researchers concluded that a two-shot plan for the HPV vaccine can work as well as a three-shot plan for young people. This may make it easier for more people to get fully vaccinated. The vaccine can also help protect boys from HPV.

The researchers said that we still need to watch for any rare or serious health problems from the vaccines over a long time. We also need more studies to know for sure if two shots prevent cancer many years later.","Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines and the number of doses administered to prevent HPV‐related disease in females and males 
Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are a group of viruses that infect the skin and mucous membranes. Some types of HPV are sexually transmitted and are common in young people. Most infections will be cleared by the immune system, but some people will experience persistent infection with certain HPV types that go on to cause abnormalities in infected cells. These changes are called 'precancerous' because they can develop into cancers of the cervix, vagina, vulva, anal canal, penis, and head and neck. Infection with other HPV types causes warts in the genital area or around the anus. 
Vaccination aims to prevent future HPV infections. Three HPV vaccines are in use – a bivalent one (protects against two HPV types), a quadrivalent one (protects against four HPV types), and a nonavalent one (protects against nine HPV types). In women, three doses of the bivalent or the quadrivalent HPV vaccines protect against precancer of the cervix caused by the HPV types contained in the vaccine. Evidence about the nonavalent vaccine, about the effects of the quadrivalent vaccine in males, and about the effects of HPV vaccines in people with HIV infection, has not yet been reviewed thoroughly. Uptake of HPV vaccines remains low in many countries. Simpler vaccine schedules, or giving the vaccine to both girls and boys, could increase the number of people being vaccinated. 
Trials of HPV vaccines are not always designed to collect data about precancer and cancer, for several reasons. Firstly, HPV vaccine is routinely given before girls become sexually active, and it is not ethical to take specimens from the cervix of girls who have not had sex. Secondly, HPV‐related precancer and cancer are rare and do not develop until years after HPV infection has occurred. Thirdly, participants in a trial will be offered treatment if precancer develops, so progression to cervical cancer would be even rarer, even without vaccination. An international committee of experts states that, in some circumstances, antibody levels (i.e. showing a strong immune system response), can be used to demonstrate protection against cervical and anal cancer. The antibody levels following vaccination in a trial should not be lower than those found in other studies on adults in whom the vaccine has been shown to protect against severe HPV‐related cervical or anal disease. 
Review question(s) 
How effective or harmful are different HPV vaccine schedules (i.e. number and timing of doses) and different HPV vaccines in females and males? 
Main results 
These results are based on research evidence to 27 September 2018. We analysed 20 studies involving 31,940 people. 
Studies comparing two doses of HPV vaccine to three doses, or comparing the time interval between doses, focus on immune system responses rather than infection or disease outcomes. Two doses of HPV vaccine result in similar immune system responses to three doses, and a longer interval (up to 12 months) between doses gives a stronger immune system response than a shorter interval. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference between the vaccine schedules for serious adverse events and death. 
In 16‐ to 26‐year‐old men, one study showed evidence of moderate certainty that a quadrivalent HPV vaccine provides better protection against external genital lesions and genital warts than a dummy treatment (control). In 16‐ to 26‐year‐old women, one study showed that the nonavalent and quadrivalent vaccines provide the same levels of protection against cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions and cancer (high‐certainty evidence). 
There was evidence that the quadrivalent vaccine resulted in more local adverse events (such as pain, swelling, and redness at the injection site) than a control treatment in males, and that the nonavalent vaccine resulted in more local adverse events than the quadrivalent vaccine in males and females. Evidence about serious adverse events and deaths from studies comparing different HPV vaccine types or dose schedules was of low or very low‐certainty. 
In people living with HIV, HPV vaccines result in reasonable levels of immune system response, but evidence about their effects on persistent HPV infection or HPV‐related disease outcomes and harms is limited. 
Certainty of the evidence 
No major issues were identified with the methodological quality of the studies for the measurements of infection and disease outcomes, or for immune system responses. Our certainty in the evidence about serious harms and deaths across all the studies comparing different HPV vaccines and vaccine schedules is low, either because of their low frequency, or because the evidence is indirect, or both. Evidence graded as high certainty means that we were confident that further research is unlikely to change our findings. Moderate‐certainty evidence means that there is a possibility that further research may have an important effect on our findings, whilst low‐certainty evidence means that our confidence was limited and further research may have an important impact on our findings. Very low‐certainty evidence means that we were uncertain about the result. 
Conclusion 
A two‐dose schedule of HPV vaccines in young females results in immune system responses that are comparable with a three‐dose schedule. In males, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine appears to be effective in the prevention of external genital lesions and genital warts. Quadrivalent and nonavalent HPV vaccines in young women result in similar levels of protection against cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions and cancer. Evidence about the efficacy and harms in people living with HIV is limited. Further long‐term population‐level studies are needed to continue monitoring safety of these vaccines, to determine for how long two doses of vaccine can provide protection against HPV‐related disease, the effect against HPV‐related cancer, and whether a two‐dose immunisation schedule will increase vaccine coverage.

Human African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, is a severe disease affecting people in the poorest parts of Africa. It is usually fatal without treatment. Conventional treatments require days of intravenous infusion, but a recently developed drug, fexinidazole, can be given orally. Another oral drug candidate, acoziborole, is undergoing clinical development and will be considered in subsequent editions.   
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of currently used drugs for treating second‐stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense trypanosomiasis (gambiense human African trypanosomiasis, g‐HAT). 
Search methods
On 14 May 2021, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database, BIOSIS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also searched reference lists of included studies, contacted researchers working in the field, and contacted relevant organizations. 
Selection criteria
Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials that included adults and children with second‐stage g‐HAT, treated with anti‐trypanosomal drugs currently in use. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors extracted data and assessed risk of bias; a third review author acted as an arbitrator if needed. The included trial only reported dichotomous outcomes, which we presented as risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).   
Main results
We included one trial comparing fexinidazole to nifurtimox combined with eflornithine (NECT). This trial was conducted between October 2012 and November 2016 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic, and included 394 participants. The study reported on efficacy and safety, with up to 24 months' follow‐up.  We judged the study to be at low risk of bias in all domains except blinding;  as the route of administration and dosing regimens differed between treatment groups,  participants and personnel were not blinded, resulting in a high risk of performance bias.   
Mortality with fexinidazole may be higher at 24 months compared to NECT. There were 9/264 deaths in the fexinidazole group and 2/130 deaths in the NECT group (RR 2.22, 95% CI 0.49 to 10.11; 394 participants; low‐certainty evidence). None of the deaths were related to treatment. 
Fexinidazole likely results in an increase in the number of people relapsing during follow‐up, with 14 participants in the fexinidazole group (14/264) and none in the NECT group (0/130) relapsing at 24 months (RD 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.08; 394 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
 We are uncertain whether there is any difference between the drugs regarding the incidence of serious adverse events at 24 months. (31/264 with fexinidazole and 13/130 with NECT group at 24 months). Adverse events were common with both drugs (247/264 with fexinidazole versus 121/130 with NECT), with no difference between groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.06; 394 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
Authors' conclusions
Oral treatment with fexinidazole is much easier to administer than conventional treatment, but deaths and relapse appear to be more common. However, the advantages or an oral option are considerable, in terms of convenience, avoiding hospitalisation and multiple intravenous infusions, thus increasing adherence.

A Study Comparing a New Pill to the Usual Treatment for Sleeping Sickness

**Rationale**

**What is sleeping sickness?**
Sleeping sickness is a very serious disease. People get it from the bite of a tsetse fly in some parts of Africa. If a person does not get treatment, they can die. This illness is a big problem for people living in poor areas.

**What is the usual treatment?**
The usual treatment for sleeping sickness is hard for patients. A person must go to a hospital or clinic. A doctor gives them medicine through a needle in their arm for many days. This is called an IV. This can be very hard for people who live far from a hospital. It also means they have to stay in the hospital, away from their families and jobs.

**Why was this study done?**
Researchers wanted to find an easier way to treat sleeping sickness. They made a new medicine that comes as a pill. The pill is called fexinidazole. A pill is much simpler to take. People can take it at home and do not need to stay in a hospital or get needles.

This study was done to compare the new pill to the usual IV treatment. The researchers wanted to see if the new pill worked as well as the old treatment. They also checked to see if the pill was safe for people to take.

**Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**
This study was a clinical trial. A clinical trial is a special type of study that tests new treatments in people. The researchers carefully planned the study to make it fair.

They used a method like flipping a coin to put people into two groups. This helps make sure the groups are compared fairly. One group took the new pill, fexinidazole. The other group got the usual IV treatment. The usual treatment is a mix of two drugs called NECT.

**Who was in the study?**
The study included 394 people. These people were both adults and children. They all had a more serious, later stage of sleeping sickness. The study took place in two countries in Africa where this sickness is common. These countries were the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic.

**How long did the study last?**
Doctors and nurses checked on the people in the study for a long time. One group had 264 people who took the pill. The other group had 130 people who got the IV treatment. The doctors followed them for up to 2 years after their treatment ended. This was to see if the sickness came back or if they had any long-term health problems.

**Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**
The study looked at how the two treatments worked. Researchers wanted to know which treatment was better at curing the sickness. They also looked at the side effects of each treatment. Side effects are health problems that a medicine can cause.

**Which treatment worked better?**
The usual IV treatment seemed to work better at getting rid of the sickness for good. When the sickness comes back after treatment, it is called a relapse. In the group that took the new pill, the sickness came back in 14 out of 264 people. In the group that got the IV treatment, the sickness did not come back for anyone.

**Were the treatments safe?**
Sadly, some people in the study died. There were more deaths in the group that took the pill. In that group, 9 out of 264 people died. In the IV treatment group, 2 out of 130 people died. The study doctors checked why they died. They found that the deaths were not caused by the medicines themselves.

Many people in both groups had side effects. These could be things like feeling sick to your stomach or having headaches. There was no big difference in the number of side effects between the pill group and the IV group.

**What did the researchers conclude?**
The researchers said that the new pill is much easier to give to people. Taking a pill at home is much better than staying in a hospital for many days to get an IV. But, the study showed that the IV treatment might be better at making sure the sickness does not come back.

Even so, having a pill that works is a big step forward. It can help many more people get treatment for this deadly disease. The great benefit of a pill is that it is simple to use. This makes it more likely that people will be able to get and finish their full treatment.","Medicines for second‐stage human African trypanosomiasis
What is the aim of this review? 
Gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (g‐HAT), or sleeping sickness, is a severe disease transmitted through the bite of infected tsetse flies found in rural parts of sub‐Saharan Africa. Sleeping sickness has two clinical stages. This review only examines treating the second‐stage, where people develop symptoms caused by invasion of the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in changes in the nervous system. Death is inevitable without treatment. Drugs for treatment are few, often require intravenous infusion every day over several weeks, and have serious side effects. In this review we aimed to compare the effects of current drugs for gambiense sleeping sickness and we examined nifurtimox‐eflornithine combination (NECT) with a new drug, fexinidazole, that can be taken orally. 
Key messages 
Whilst fexinidazole cures some people, deaths from any cause and treatment failure rates are higher than with conventional treatment. Adverse events were common in both groups. Fexinidazole is more practical to give, and means less time in hospital for intravenous treatment infusion. 
What was studied in this review? 
We looked at the evidence about the benefits and harms of current drugs used in people with second stage g‐HAT. We searched for randomized trials, which provide robust evidence about the various treatments. We aimed to determine whether any drug provides a definite advantage over the other, measured in terms of clinical outcomes and in relation to the severity of adverse effects. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We only identified one suitable trial, which included 394 people and was conducted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic. The trial showed that deaths from any cause at 24 months may be higher with fexinidazole compared with NECT. Nine of the 264 people who took fexinidazole died, compared with two of the 130 people who took NECT. Fexinidazole probably increases the number of people who relapse during two years. Fourteen people in the fexinidazole group relapsed, and none in the NECT group. Adverse events were very common in both groups over the two years, and there is not likely to be much difference between the two drugs (247/264 in the fexinidazole group and 121/130 in the NECT group). We do not know about the effect of fexinidazole on serious adverse events, as the evidence is very uncertain. There were 31/264 serious adverse events in the fexinidazole group and 13/130 in the NECT group at 24 months.  
How up to date is this review? 
The evidence is current to 14 May 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013860.pub2,"Background
Physicians often prescribe opioids for pain in the acute care setting. Nausea and vomiting are well‐described adverse events, occurring in over one‐third of patients. Prophylactic antiemetics may be one option to reduce opioid‐associated nausea and vomiting. However, these medications also have their own adverse effects, so it is important to understand their efficacy and safety prior to routine use. This is a review of randomized controlled trials comparing prophylactic antiemetics versus placebo or standard care for preventing opioid‐associated nausea and vomiting. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of prophylactic antiemetics for nausea and vomiting in adults (aged 16 years or older) receiving intravenous opioids in the acute care setting. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID) from inception to January 2022, and Google Scholar (17 January 2022). We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and screened reference lists. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials of prophylactic antiemetics versus placebo or standard care in adults prior to receiving an intravenous opioid. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (MG, JNC) independently determined the eligibility of each study according to the inclusion criteria. Two review authors (MG, GDP) then independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and determined the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Our primary outcomes were the occurrence of nausea, vomiting, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes included nausea severity, number of vomiting episodes, and number of participants requiring antiemetic rescue therapy. We presented outcomes as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data (e.g. presence of vomiting, presence of nausea, number of participants requiring rescue medication, adverse events) and mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference for continuous data (e.g. number of vomiting episodes, nausea severity) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). 
Main results
We included three studies involving 527 participants (187 women and 340 men) with a mean age of 42 years.  All studies used intravenous metoclopramide (10 mg) as the intervention and a placebo for the comparator. No studies assessed any other antiemetic or compared the intervention to standard care. 
Compared to placebo, metoclopramide did not reduce vomiting (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.26 to 5.32; low‐certainty evidence) or nausea (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.15 to 2.03; low‐certainty evidence) and there was no difference in adverse events (RR 2.34, 95% CI 0.47 to 11.61; low‐certainty evidence).  No data were available regarding the number of vomiting episodes. Metoclopramide did reduce the severity of nausea compared with placebo (MD −0.49, 95% CI −0.75 to −0.23; low‐certainty evidence) but did not reduce the need for rescue medication (RR 1.86, 95% CI 0.17 to 20.16; low‐certainty evidence).  
Two studies were at unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation, one for blinding of outcome assessors, one for incomplete outcome data, and two for selective reporting. The studies were at low risk of bias for all remaining components. 
Authors' conclusions
There was no evidence that prophylactic metoclopramide affected the risk of vomiting, nausea, or the need for rescue medication when provided prior to intravenous opioids in the acute care setting. There was a clinically insignificant difference in nausea severity when comparing prophylactic metoclopramide with placebo. Overall, the evidence was of low certainty. Future research could better delineate the effects of prophylactic antiemetics on specific populations, and new studies are needed to evaluate the use of other prophylactic antiemetic agents, for which there were no data.

Does a medicine to prevent sickness help people who take strong pain drugs in the hospital? A review of studies.

**Rationale**

When people have a lot of pain in the hospital, doctors may give them strong pain drugs. These drugs are often called opioids. They can work well for pain. But they also have side effects.

A common side effect is feeling sick to your stomach. People may also throw up. This happens to about 1 in 3 people who take these pain drugs. Feeling sick can make a hard time in the hospital even worse.

Doctors wanted to know if they could prevent this sickness. One idea was to give an anti-sickness medicine *before* giving the pain drug. The hope was that this would stop the sickness before it started.

But the anti-sickness medicines can also have their own side effects. So, it is important to know if they really work and if they are safe. This review of past studies was done to find out if giving an anti-sickness drug first is a good idea.

**Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked for all the good studies that were already done on this topic. This is called a review. It helps to bring all the information together.

The researchers looked for a special type of study. In these studies, patients were put into groups by chance. This helps make the results fair.

In the studies they found, there were two groups of patients. One group got an anti-sickness drug before they got the pain drug. The other group got a placebo. A placebo is a fake treatment, like a shot of salt water. It has no medicine in it. This lets researchers see if the real medicine works better than nothing.

The review found three studies to look at. A total of 527 adults were in these studies. There were 187 women and 340 men. The average age of the people in the studies was 42 years old. In all three studies, the anti-sickness drug used was metoclopramide. It was given to patients through a needle in a vein.

**Results**

The main goal was to see if the anti-sickness drug worked better than the placebo. The researchers looked at what happened to the people in both groups.

They found that the anti-sickness drug did not stop people from throwing up. The number of people who threw up was about the same in both groups. The drug also did not stop people from feeling sick to their stomach.

The researchers also looked at how sick people felt. The drug did seem to make the feeling of sickness a little less strong. But this difference was very small. It was likely not a big enough change for patients to feel much better.

Sometimes, if a medicine does not work, doctors give a different one. This is called a rescue medicine. The anti-sickness drug did not lower the number of people who needed a rescue medicine.

The researchers also checked for side effects. There was no real difference in side effects between the real drug and the placebo.

Based on these three studies, the researchers did not find proof that the anti-sickness drug helped. It did not seem to prevent sickness or throwing up from pain drugs. The researchers said they were not very sure about these results. This is because the studies were small. More research in the future could change these findings. New studies are needed to test other kinds of anti-sickness drugs.","Prophylactic antiemetics for adults receiving intravenous opioids in the acute care setting 
Key messages 
Metoclopramide did not reduce the risk of vomiting, nausea, or the need for rescue medication when provided prior to intravenous opioids in the emergency department.  
In terms of the severity of nausea, metoclopramide did not help patients any more than placebo (sham treatment). 
What is opioid‐induced emesis? 
Physicians often give patients opioids for pain in emergency departments, but over a third experience the side effects of nausea and vomiting (emesis). Some experts have suggested that taking antiemetics before receiving the opioid (that is, as a prophylactic) could prevent these symptoms from occurring. However, these medications have their own side effects, so it is important to understand whether they are effective and safe before routinely using them. 
What did we want to find out? 
This review looks at whether taking antiemetics (medications to treat or prevent nausea and vomiting) before receiving an intravenous opioid reduces the risk of experiencing nausea and vomiting as side effects. 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies involving adults (aged 16 years or older) who received prophylactic antiemetics compared with either placebo or standard care before receiving an intravenous opioid. 
What did we find? 
We found three studies with a total of 527 patients. All the studies used metoclopramide as the antiemetic. Compared with placebo, metoclopramide did not reduce the risk of vomiting, nausea, or the need for an antiemetic later on. There was also no difference in side effects between those who received antiemetics and those who did not. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
The studies investigated only one medication (metoclopramide) and did not report all the information we were interested in. The intervention probably makes little or no difference in terms of experiencing nausea or vomiting. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
This evidence is up to date to 17 January 2022.

Finding the Best Ways to Help People with Lung Disease (COPD) Get More Active

### **Rationale**

**What is COPD?**
Some people have a long-term lung problem called COPD. The full name is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This illness can make it very hard to breathe. Simple things like walking up stairs can make a person feel tired and out of breath.

**Why is being active important?**
Moving our bodies is good for everyone’s health. It keeps our hearts and muscles strong. For people with COPD, being active can be very helpful for their health. But it can also be very hard to do because of their breathing problems.

**Why was this research needed?**
Doctors and researchers want to find the best ways to support people with COPD. They want to help them be more active in a safe and helpful way. Right now, we do not know for sure what works best. This study was needed to look at all the research that has already been done. By gathering all the results in one place, researchers hoped to find the most helpful ideas.

### **Trial Design**

**How did the researchers study this?**
This study was a review. This means the researchers did not do a new experiment with patients. Instead, they looked for all the studies that had already been done on this topic. They gathered and carefully read 76 different studies to get a bigger picture.

**Who was in these studies?**
In total, the 76 studies included more than 8,000 people. Every person in these studies had COPD. The time people spent in each study was different.

**What was a challenge with this study?**
It was hard to compare all the different studies. Each study measured being active in its own way. The plans to help people get active were also very different from each other. This made it difficult for the researchers to mix all the results together to find a clear answer.

### **Results**

**What ideas have been tested?**
The researchers found that many different methods have been tried to help people with COPD. Some studies tested special exercise programs for the lungs. These programs are often called pulmonary rehabilitation. Other studies looked at different types of exercise training. Some studies also taught people how to manage their own health better.

**What were the main results?**
Some methods did seem to help people become more active. The ideas that seemed to work best were exercise training and talking to a counselor about being active. Some COPD medicines also seemed to help people move more.

**How much more active did people get?**
In the studies that showed good results, people moved more each day. They did about 6 to 24 extra minutes of activity. This activity was at least medium-hard. People in these studies also walked for longer or took more steps each day.

**What did the researchers conclude?**
Even though some things seemed to work, the researchers are still not sure what is best. The proof from the studies was not very strong. This was because many studies were small or were not described clearly. It was hard to know exactly what made a difference.

**What about staying active long-term?**
Very few studies checked on people after the program ended. Because of this, we do not know if these methods help people stay active for a long time. To get health benefits, people need to stay active for months and years. The researchers said that we need more and better studies. This will help us find clear answers to support all people with COPD.","What are the most effective ways to encourage people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to be more physically active?

Human milk as compared to formula reduces morbidity in preterm infants but requires fortification to meet their nutritional needs and to reduce the risk of extrauterine growth failure. Standard fortification methods are not individualized to the infant and assume that breast milk is uniform in nutritional content. Strategies for individualizing fortification are available; however it is not known whether these are safe, or if they improve outcomes in preterm infants. 
Objectives
To determine whether individualizing fortification of breast milk feeds in response to infant blood urea nitrogen (adjustable fortification) or to breast milk macronutrient content as measured with a milk analyzer (targeted fortification) reduces mortality and morbidity and promotes growth and development compared to standard, non‐individualized fortification for preterm infants receiving human milk at < 37 weeks' gestation or at birth weight < 2500 grams. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 9), in the Cochrane Library; Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Daily and Versions(R); and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), on September 20, 2019. We also searched clinical trials databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles for pertinent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomized trials. 
Selection criteria
We considered randomized, quasi‐randomized, and cluster‐randomized controlled trials of preterm infants fed exclusively breast milk that compared a standard non‐individualized fortification strategy to individualized fortification using a targeted or adjustable strategy. We considered studies that examined any use of fortification in eligible infants for a minimum duration of two weeks, initiated at any time during enteral feeding, and providing any regimen of human milk feeding. 
Data collection and analysis
Data were collected using the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal. Two review authors evaluated the quality of the studies and extracted data. We reported analyses of continuous data using mean differences (MDs), and dichotomous data using risk ratios (RRs). We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
Data were extracted from seven RCTs, resulting in eight publications (521 total participants were enrolled among these studies), with duration of study interventions ranging from two to seven weeks. As compared to standard non‐individualized fortification, individualized (targeted or adjustable) fortification of enteral feeds probably increased weight gain during the intervention (typical mean difference [MD] 1.88 g/kg/d, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.26 to 2.50; 6 studies, 345 participants), may have increased length gain during the intervention (typical MD 0.43 mm/d, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.53; 5 studies, 242 participants), and may have increased head circumference gain during the intervention (typical MD 0.14 mm/d, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.23; 5 studies, 242 participants). Compared to standard non‐individualized fortification, targeted fortification probably increased weight gain during the intervention (typical MD 1.87 g/kg/d, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.58; 4 studies, 269 participants) and may have increased length gain during the intervention (typical MD 0.45 mm/d, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.57; 3 studies, 166 participants). Adjustable fortification probably increased weight gain during the intervention (typical MD 2.86 g/kg/d, 95% CI 1.69 to 4.03; 3 studies, 96 participants), probably increased gain in length during the intervention (typical MD 0.54 mm/d, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.7; 3 studies, 96 participants), and increased gain in head circumference during the intervention (typical MD 0.36 mm/d, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.5; 3 studies, 96 participants). We are uncertain whether there are differences between individualized versus standard fortification strategies in the incidence of in‐hospital mortality, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, culture‐proven late‐onset bacterial sepsis, retinopathy of prematurity, osteopenia, length of hospital stay, or post‐hospital discharge growth. No study reported severe neurodevelopmental disability as an outcome. One study that was published after our literature search was completed is awaiting classification. 
Authors' conclusions
We found moderate‐ to low‐certainty evidence suggesting that individualized (either targeted or adjustable) fortification of enteral feeds in very low birth weight infants increases growth velocity of weight, length, and head circumference during the intervention compared with standard non‐individualized fortification. Evidence showing important in‐hospital and post‐discharge clinical outcomes was sparse and of very low certainty, precluding inferences regarding safety or clinical benefits beyond short‐term growth.

Personalizing Nutrition for Babies Born Early: Does It Help Them Grow Better?

**Rationale**

**Why is good nutrition important for babies born early?**

Babies who are born too early, also called preterm babies, need special care to grow healthy and strong. Mother's milk is the best food for them. But sometimes, mother's milk alone does not have enough of the nutrients these tiny babies need. Nutrients include things like protein, vitamins, and minerals.

To help them grow well, doctors add extra nutrients to the mother's milk. This is called ""fortification."" It makes the milk stronger and richer in what the baby needs. This can help prevent babies from having problems with growth after they are born.

**What was this study about?**

Usually, doctors add the same amount of extra nutrients for all preterm babies. This is called ""standard fortification."" But we know that every mother's milk is a little different. And every baby's needs are different. The standard way might not be the best way for every single baby.

Researchers wanted to know if a more personal way of adding nutrients would work better. This is called ""individualized fortification."" They looked at two personal ways to do this:
*   One way is to test the mother's milk to see exactly how much protein, fat, and sugar is in it. Then, doctors add just what is needed.
*   Another way is to do a blood test on the baby. This test shows if the baby is getting enough protein. Doctors can then change the amount of nutrients based on the test results.

This study looked at whether these personal ways of adding nutrients helped babies grow better and were safer than the standard way.

**Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

The researchers did not do a new experiment with babies. Instead, they did a special type of study called a review. This means they looked for all the good medical studies that had already been done on this topic. They combined the results from all these studies to get a stronger answer.

The researchers looked for studies that compared the standard way of adding nutrients to the two personal ways. In these studies, babies were put into different groups by chance. Some babies got the standard food, and others got the food with nutrients added just for them.

**Who was in the studies?**

The review looked at 7 different studies. In total, 521 babies were part of these studies. All the babies were born early (before 37 weeks of pregnancy) or were very small when they were born.

The babies in these studies received the special food for about 2 to 7 weeks while they were in the hospital. The researchers checked to see how well they grew during this time.

**Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The review found that adding nutrients in a personal way helped babies grow better in the short term.

Babies who received food with nutrients added just for them had better growth.
*   They gained more weight each day.
*   They grew longer.
*   Their heads grew bigger. A baby's head growth is an important sign of brain growth.

This was true for both personal methods. It worked when doctors checked the mother’s milk and when they checked the baby’s blood to decide on the right amount of nutrients.

**What about other health problems?**

The researchers also wanted to know if the personal way of adding nutrients was safer. They looked at serious health problems that can affect preterm babies. But the studies did not have enough information to give a clear answer. The researchers are not sure if the personal way is better or worse than the standard way for preventing these health problems.

The studies also did not look at how the babies' brains developed as they grew up. There was not much information about how the babies grew after they went home from the hospital.

**What do these results mean?**

This review shows that personalizing nutrition can help very small babies grow faster while they are in the hospital. This is an important finding.

However, we still need more research. We need to know if this better growth leads to better health in the long run. Future studies should also check to make sure there are no risks and see how these babies develop years later.","Individualized versus standard diet fortification for growth and development in very low birth weight infants receiving human milk 
Review question: does individualized rather than standard, non‐individualized addition of nutrients and calories to breast milk feeds safely improve growth and other outcomes in preterm infants? 
Background: preterm infants are at risk for poor growth following birth. Breast milk reduces their risk of illness but does not meet their nutritional needs. Therefore, breast milk fed to preterm infants must be fortified with extra nutrients. Usual methods of fortifying breast milk treat all breast milk and all preterm infants the same. However, two methods are available for individualizing fortification for each preterm infant. Targeted fortification adds nutrients to breast milk based on the results of breast milk analysis. Adjustable fortification adds nutrients based on the results of preterm infant laboratory results. Individualized fortification may improve preterm infant growth or other outcomes. However, it is not known whether targeted or adjustable fortification is safe or improves outcomes for preterm infants compared with the standard method. 
Study characteristics: through literature searches updated to September 2019, we found seven studies that tested the effects of targeted or adjustable fortification of breast milk feeds compared to standard fortification in preterm infants, yielding eight publications (521 total participants were enrolled in these studies). One study that was published after our literature search was completed is awaiting classification. 
Key results: targeted or adjustable fortification improves short‐term growth compared to standard fortification in preterm infants. Determining the best way to customize breast milk feeds is necessary, as is clarifying its safety and effects on other clinical outcomes. 
Certainty of evidence: very low to moderate. Moderate certainty means that the true effect of individualized fortification on growth in preterm infants is likely to be close to the result of this review but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Low certainty means that the true effect may be substantially different from the results of this review. Very low certainty means that the true effect of individualized fortification on growth in preterm infants is likely to be substantially different from the results of this review. Certainty of evidence was downgraded most often in this review due to small numbers of participants in included studies and significant differences in study design and outcome measures among included studies.

10.1002-14651858.CD014698,"Background
Ultrasound examination of pregnancy before 24 weeks gestation may lead to more accurate dating and earlier diagnosis of pathology, but may also give false reassurance. It can be used to monitor development or diagnose conditions of an unborn baby. This review compares the effect of routine or universal, ultrasound examination, performed before 24 completed weeks' gestation, with selective or no ultrasound examination.  
Objectives
To assess the effect of routine pregnancy ultrasound before 24 weeks as part of a screening programme, compared to selective ultrasound or no ultrasound, on the early diagnosis of abnormal pregnancy location, termination for fetal congenital abnormality, multiple pregnancy, maternal outcomes and later fetal compromise. 
To assess the effect of first trimester (before 14 weeks) and second trimester (14 to 24 weeks) ultrasound, separately. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 11 August 2020. We also examined the reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, cluster‐RCTs and RCTs published in abstract form. We included all trials with pregnant women who had routine or revealed ultrasound versus selective ultrasound, no ultrasound, or concealed ultrasound, before 24 weeks' gestation. All eligible studies were screened for scientific integrity and trustworthiness. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and risk of bias, extracted data and checked extracted data for accuracy. Two review authors independently used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome 
Main results
Our review included data from 13 RCTs including 85,265 women. The review included four comparisons. Four trials were assessed to be at low risk of bias for both sequence generation and allocation concealment and two as high risk. The nature of the intervention made it impossible to blind women and staff providing care to treatment allocation.  Sample attrition was low in the majority of trials and outcome data were available for most women. Many trials were conducted before it was customary for trials to be registered and protocols published. 
First trimester routine versus selective ultrasound: four studies, 1791 women, from Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US). 
First trimester scans probably reduce short‐term maternal anxiety about pregnancy (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 0.99; moderate‐certainty evidence). We do not have information on whether the reduction was sustained.  
The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of first trimester scans on perinatal loss (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.73; 648 participants; one study; low‐certainty evidence) or induction of labour for post‐maturity (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.37; 1474 participants; three studies; low‐certainty evidence). 
The effect of routine first trimester ultrasound on birth before 34 weeks or termination of pregnancy for fetal abnormality was not reported. 
Second trimester routine versus selective ultrasound: seven studies, 36,053 women, from Finland, Norway, South Africa, Sweden and the US. 
Second trimester scans probably make little difference to perinatal loss (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.20; 17,918 participants, three studies; moderate‐certainty evidence) or intrauterine fetal death (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.42; 29,584 participants, three studies; low‐certainty evidence). 
Second trimester scans may reduce induction of labour for post‐maturity (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.73; 24,174 participants, six studies; low‐certainty evidence), presumably by more accurate dating. 
Routine second trimester ultrasound may improve detection of multiple pregnancy (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.16; 274 participants, five studies; low‐certainty evidence). 
Routine second trimester ultrasound may increase detection of major fetal abnormality before 24 weeks (RR 3.45, 95% CI 1.67 to 7.12; 387 participants, two studies; low‐certainty evidence) and probably increases the number of women terminating pregnancy for major anomaly (RR 2.36, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.93; 26,893 participants, four studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Long‐term follow‐up of children exposed to scans before birth did not indicate harm to children's physical or intellectual development (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.34; 603 participants, one study; low‐certainty evidence). 
The effect of routine second trimester ultrasound on birth before 34 weeks or maternal anxiety was not reported. 
Standard care plus two ultrasounds and referral for complications versus standard care: one cluster‐RCT, 47,431 women, from Democratic Republic of Congo, Guatemala, Kenya, Pakistan and Zambia. 
This trial included a co‐intervention, training of healthcare workers and referral for complications and was, therefore, assessed separately. 
Standard pregnancy care plus two scans, and training and referral for complications, versus standard care probably makes little difference to whether women with complications give birth in a risk appropriate setting with facilities for caesarean section (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.19; 11,680 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  The intervention also probably makes little to no difference to low birthweight (< 2500 g) (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.13; 47,312 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about whether the community intervention (including ultrasound) makes any difference to maternal mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.55; 46,768 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Revealed ultrasound results (communicated to both patient and doctor) versus concealed ultrasound results (blinded to both patient and doctor at any time before 24 weeks): one study, 1095 women, from the UK. 
The evidence was very uncertain for all results relating to revealed versus concealed ultrasound scan (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Early scans probably reduce short term maternal anxiety. 
Later scans may reduce labour induction for post‐maturity. They may improve detection of major fetal abnormalities and increase the number of women who choose termination of pregnancy for this reason. They may also reduce the number of undetected twin pregnancies. All these findings accord with observational data.  
Neither type of scan appears to alter other important maternal or fetal outcomes, but our review may underestimate the effect in modern practice because trials were mostly  from relatively early in the development of the technology, and many control participants also had scans. The trials were also underpowered to show an effect on other important maternal or fetal outcomes.

Are Early Ultrasound Scans in Pregnancy Helpful for Mothers and Babies?

**Rationale**
An ultrasound is a scan that uses sound waves to create a picture of a baby in the womb. This scan is safe for both the mother and the baby. Doctors use these pictures to check on a baby’s health and growth during pregnancy. The scan can show if the baby is developing as expected. It can also help find any health problems early.

In some places, every pregnant woman is offered a scan. This is called a routine scan. In other places, a woman gets a scan only if her doctor thinks it is needed. This is called a selective scan. People have wondered which way is better for mothers and their babies.

Researchers wanted to find a clear answer to this question. They did a study to learn about the effects of routine scans. They wanted to know if these scans help find problems, like twins or other health issues, sooner. They also wanted to know if scans change how mothers feel about their pregnancy.

**Trial Design**
This study was a review. This means the researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they gathered and studied the results of 13 older studies that had already been done. By looking at all the studies together, they hoped to get a stronger answer.

The 13 studies were large. In total, they included more than 85,000 pregnant women. These women were from many different countries all over the world. This helps make the results useful for many people.

In the original studies, women were placed into different groups by chance. One group of women was offered a routine ultrasound scan before they were 24 weeks pregnant. The other group of women only had a scan if their doctor saw a special reason for it. The researchers then looked at what happened to the mothers and babies in each group.

**Results**
The researchers found that the timing of the scan seemed to matter. The effects were different for scans done very early in pregnancy compared to scans done a bit later.

**What did early scans show?**
Early scans are those done in the first three months of pregnancy, before 14 weeks. The study found that mothers who had an early scan were likely to feel less worried about their pregnancy right after the scan.

But, the study could not tell if this feeling of relief lasted for the whole pregnancy. There was also not enough information to know if early scans helped in other ways. For example, it was not clear if they helped prevent losing a baby around the time of birth.

**What did later scans show?**
Later scans are those done between 14 and 24 weeks of pregnancy. These scans seemed to have several benefits. They helped doctors get a very accurate due date for the baby. This was important for the mother’s care.

Because the due date was more accurate, fewer women needed to have their labor started by a doctor. This happens when a doctor thinks a baby is overdue. A good due date helps avoid starting labor when it is not truly needed.

These later scans were also much better at finding out if a woman was pregnant with twins or triplets. Finding this out early helps doctors and parents prepare. The scans also helped find major health problems that a baby might be born with.

When a major health problem was found on a scan, more women made the difficult choice to end their pregnancy. It is also important to know if scans are safe in the long run. The review found no evidence that the children who had scans before birth had any problems with their physical growth or their ability to learn later in life.

**What did the researchers conclude?**
In summary, getting an ultrasound scan early in pregnancy can be helpful. An early scan may help a mother feel less worried. A scan done a bit later can give a better due date, find twins, and spot major health problems.

The researchers added a note of caution. Most of the studies they looked at were quite old. The ultrasound machines used in those studies are not as good as the ones we have today. Also, many women in the ""no scan"" groups still got scans. These things may have made it harder to see the true benefits. More research with modern tools is needed to be sure about all the effects.","Routine ultrasound scans for babies before 24 weeks of pregnancy.
We set out to determine the effect of routine ultrasound scans early in pregnancy (before 24 weeks). This was in comparison to no scan at all, or scans only when a clinical problem was suspected, such as if the woman has vaginal bleeding, or the baby is at high risk of having an abnormality. 
What is the issue? 
Ultrasound scans send out high‐frequency sound waves directed to the area being examined, and use the reflected sound to make an image. This review considers two types of scan in the first half of pregnancy.  Early scans (before 14 weeks) mainly aim to count the number of babies, to check they are growing in the correct place and check the pregnancy dates.  Later scans, typically done around 18 to 24 weeks, recheck all the above, and also examine the baby's anatomy and whether the placenta (afterbirth) is in the correct place. Both types of scan may cause parental anxiety and a false positive diagnoses could lead to harm. The aim of this review is to compare routine with selective or no scans. 
Why is this important? 
It has been assumed that routine scans before 24 weeks' gestation will result in the earlier detection of problems and improve management and the pregnancy outcome. The alternative is selective scans for specific reasons. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials. We found 13 studies including 85,265 women. We included two main comparisons. 
Routine early scanning  
Ultrasound scans in the first 14 weeks reduced short‐term maternal worries about the pregnancy. There was no evidence of a clear effect on induction of labour to prevent the pregnancy going overdue, loss of the baby, early birth (before 34 weeks) or mothers choosing termination for baby abnormalities. 
Routine later scanning  
Second trimester scans, at 14 to 24 weeks, increased detection of baby abnormalities, and more women chose termination of pregnancy for this reason. There was no evidence of an effect on perinatal loss. Induction of labour to prevent the pregnancy going overdue was reduced. No studies reported how it affected maternal anxiety. Multiple pregnancies were more likely to be detected by 24 weeks. Long‐term follow‐up of children exposed to these scans did not indicate that they were harmful to children's physical or intellectual development. 
We also found one trial from a group of low and middle income countries, comparing a combination of two scans and specialist training of health professionals and referral of women with complications, with selective scans and routine care. The intervention did not alter the number of women delivering in a hospital with caesarean section facility. Nor did it appear to reduce maternal deaths or the numbers of low‐birthweight babies, although the evidence was very uncertain. 
We also found one trial where all women underwent scans but the results were revealed to the health care professionals in half the cases. This trial showed no important effect of revealing the scan results but the evidence was very uncertain. 
Most studies were carried out relatively early in the development of scan technology and when training in its use was less advanced. In most trials a large proportion of women in the control groups received a scan too. 
What does this mean? 
Early scans probably reduce maternal worries about the baby in the short term. Later scans may reduce labour induction to prevent the pregnancy going overdue. They may also improve detection of major abnormalities in the baby and increase the number of women who choose pregnancy termination for this reason. They may also reduce the number of undetected twin pregnancies. All these findings accord with common sense.  
Although neither type of scan appears to alter other important outcomes, our review may underestimate the effect in modern practice because the trials were mostly from relatively early in the development of scan technology, and many participants in the control arms also had scans.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the PD‐1/PD‐L1 axis have changed the first‐line treatment of people with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Single‐agent pembrolizumab (a PD‐1 inhibitor) is currently the standard of care as monotherapy in patients with PD‐L1 expression ≥ 50%, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy when PD‐L1 expression is less than 50%. Atezolizumab (PD‐L1 inhibitor) has also been approved in combination with chemotherapy and bevacizumab (an anti‐angiogenic antibody) in first‐line NSCLC regardless of PD‐L1 expression. The combination of first‐line PD‐1/PD‐L1 inhibitors with anti‐CTLA‐4 antibodies has also been shown to improve survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC, particularly in people with high tumour mutational burden (TMB). The association of ipilimumab (an anti CTLA4) and nivolumab (PD‐1 inhibitor) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in all patients with PD‐L1 expression ≥1%. Although these antibodies are currently used in clinical practice, some questions remain unanswered, such as the best‐treatment strategy, the role of different biomarkers for treatment selection and the effectiveness of immunotherapy according to specific clinical characteristics. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of first‐line immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), as monotherapy or in combination, compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab for people with advanced NSCLC, according to the level of PD‐L1 expression. 
Search methods
We performed an electronic search of the main databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase) from inception until 31 December 2020 and conferences meetings from 2015 onwards. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the efficacy or safety of first‐line ICI treatment for adults with advanced NSCLC who had not previously received any anticancer treatment. We included trials comparing single‐ or double‐ICI treatment to standard first‐line therapy (platinum‐based chemotherapy +/‐ bevacizumab). All data come from ‘international multicentre studies involving adults, age 18 or over, with histologically‐confirmed stage IV NSCLC. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently assessed the search results and a fourth review author resolved any disagreements. Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS); secondary outcomes were overall objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST v 1.1, grade 3 to 5 treatment‐related adverse events (AEs) (CTCAE v 5.0) and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). We performed meta‐analyses where appropriate using the random‐effects model for hazard ratios (HRs) or risk ratios (RRs), with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), and used the I² statistic to investigate heterogeneity. 
Main results
Main results 
We identified 15 trials for inclusion, seven completed and eight ongoing trials. We obtained data for 5893 participants from seven trials comparing first‐line single‐ (six trials) or double‐ (two trials) agent ICI with platinum‐based chemotherapy, one trial comparing both first‐line single‐ and double‐agent ICsI with platinum‐based chemotherapy. All trials were at low risk of selection and detection bias, some were classified at high risk of performance, attrition or other source of bias. The overall certainty of evidence according to GRADE ranged from moderate‐to‐low because of risk of bias, inconsistency, or imprecision. The majority of the included trials reported their outcomes by PD‐L1 expressions, with PD‐L1 ≥ 50 being considered the most clinically useful cut‐off level for decision makers. Also, iIn order to avoid overlaps between various PDL‐1 expressions we prioritised the review outcomes according to PD‐L1 ≥ 50. 
Single‐agent ICIIn the PD‐L1 expression ≥ 50% group single‐agent ICI probably improved OS compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (hazard ratio (HR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.76, 6 RCTs, 2111 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). In this group, single‐agent ICI also may improve PFS (HR: 0.68, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.88, 5 RCTs, 1886 participants, low‐certainty evidence) and ORR (risk ratio (RR):1.40, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.75, 4 RCTs, 1672 participants, low‐certainty evidence). HRQoL data were available for only one study including only people with PD‐L1 expression ≥ 50%, which suggested that single‐agent ICI may improve HRQoL at 15 weeks compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (RR: 1.51, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.10, 1 RCT, 297 participants, low‐certainty evidence).In the included studies, treatment‐related AEs were not reported according to PD‐L1 expression levels. Grade 3‐4 AEs may be less frequent with single‐agent ICI compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (RR: 0.41, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.50, I² = 62%, 5 RCTs, 3346 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
More information about efficacy of single‐agent ICI compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy according to the level of PD‐L1 expression and to TMB status or specific clinical characteristics is available in the full text. 
Double‐agent ICI Double‐ICI treatment probably prolonged OS compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy in people with PD‐L1 expression ≥50% (HR: 0.72, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.89 2 RCTs, 612 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence).Trials did not report data on HRQoL, PFS and ORR according to PD‐L1 groups.Treatment related AEs were not reported according to PD‐L1 expression levels. The frequency of grade 3‐4 AEs may not differ between double‐ICI treatment and platinum‐based chemotherapy (RR: 0.78, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.09, I² = 81%, 2 RCTs, 1869 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
More information about efficacy of double‐agent ICI according to the level of PD‐L1 expression and to TMB status is available in the full text. 
Authors' conclusions
Authors' conclusions 
The evidence in this review suggests that single‐agent ICI in people with NSCLC and PD‐L1 ≥50% probably leads to a higher overall survival rate and may lead to a higher progression‐free survival and overall response rate when compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy and may also lead to a lower rate of adverse events and higher HRQoL. Combined ICI in people with NSCLC and PD‐L1 ≥50% also probably leads to a higher overall survival rate when compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy, but its effect on progression‐free survival, overall response rate and HRQoL is unknown due to a lack of data. The rate of adverse events may not differ between groups. 
This review used to be a living review. It is transitioned out of living mode because current research is exploring ICI in association with chemotherapy or other immunotherapeutic drugs versus ICI as single agent rather than platinum based chemotherapy.

New Drugs Versus Chemotherapy for a Type of Lung Cancer

### **Rationale**

A common type of lung cancer is called advanced non-small cell lung cancer. This can be a serious illness that is hard to treat. For a long time, the main treatment has been chemotherapy. Chemotherapy uses strong drugs to kill cancer cells. But it can also cause difficult side effects.

Newer drugs are now available. These drugs are a type of treatment called immunotherapy. Immunotherapy does not kill cancer cells directly. Instead, it helps your body's own defense system, called the immune system, fight the cancer.

Cancer cells can make signals that help them hide from your immune system. The new immunotherapy drugs block these signals. This allows your immune system to find and attack the cancer cells. This study was done to see if these new drugs work better than the usual chemotherapy. The researchers wanted to know if using one new drug, or two new drugs together, helps people live longer and have a better life.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a single study where new patients were treated. Instead, the researchers looked at the results of many other studies that were already completed. They combined all the information from these past studies to get a clearer and stronger answer.

The studies they looked at included adults, age 18 and older. All the people in these studies had advanced non-small cell lung cancer. It was the first time they were being treated for this cancer.

Each study compared one or two of the new immunotherapy drugs to the standard chemotherapy treatment. By looking at all these studies together, the researchers could see the bigger picture of how well the new drugs work.

### **Results**

The researchers found that the new drugs worked best for people whose cancer had a lot of a certain marker. This marker is called PD-L1. When cancer cells have a lot of PD-L1, they are very good at hiding from the immune system.

**One New Drug Versus Chemotherapy**

For people whose cancer had a lot of the PD-L1 marker, the study found good results.
*   People who took one new immunotherapy drug probably lived longer than people who got chemotherapy.
*   The new drug also seemed to stop the cancer from growing for a longer time.
*   Tumors were more likely to shrink in people who took the new drug.
*   People who took the new drug had fewer serious side effects than those on chemotherapy.
*   The new drug may also lead to a better quality of life for patients.

**Two New Drugs Versus Chemotherapy**

The researchers also looked at what happened when two new immunotherapy drugs were used together. This was also in people whose cancer had a lot of the PD-L1 marker.
*   People who took two new drugs also probably lived longer than people who got chemotherapy.
*   But there was not enough information to know if this treatment stopped the cancer from growing for longer.
*   There was also not enough information to know if tumors shrank more often or if quality of life was better.
*   The number of serious side effects was about the same as with chemotherapy.

Based on all the studies, the researchers concluded that using one new immunotherapy drug is likely a better choice than chemotherapy for people with this type of lung cancer and a lot of the PD-L1 marker. Using two drugs also helps people live longer, but more research is needed to understand all of its benefits and risks.","Immunotherapy versus chemotherapy for people with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer who have not been not previously been treated 
Review question 
Is immunotherapy more effective and less toxic than chemotherapy for people diagnosed with non‐small cell lung cancer (a subtype of lung cancer) who have not previously been treated and who are not suitable for curative treatment? 
Background 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths and non‐small cell lung cancer represent more than 85% of all lung cancer cases. Curative surgery and radiotherapy are not treatment options when the disease is at an advanced stage and until recently these people were offered chemotherapy. Since 2016, immunotherapies (antibodies able to stimulate the immune system against cancer cells) have been shown to improve survival for these patients. 
Side effects of immunotherapies are mainly inflammation of the tissues caused by the activation of the immune system against different organs, while chemotherapy usually causes a reduction in the white blood cells and red blood cells, hair loss, nausea and vomiting.In this Cochrane Review, we tried to find out how effective and safe immunotherapies (given alone or as combinations) are compared to standard chemotherapy for people with non‐small cell lung cancer who are not suitable for possibly curative treatment. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the main databases and records of conference meetings up to 31st December 2020. We included seven studies (5893 participants) comparing immunotherapies (antibodies that interact with specific proteins called immune checkpoints) with chemotherapy for people with non‐small cell lung cancer not previously treated. 
Key results 
We reported the results by PD‐L1 levels (a protein produced by the tumour or immune cells and bound by immune checkpoint inhibitors) 
In people with more than 50% of tumour/immune cells expressing PD‐L1 protein, single immunotherapy might improve survival with fewer side effects. In addition, treatment with combined immunotherapies may improve survival in both people with high expression of PD‐L1 protein.The rate of toxic effects may be the same for people treated with combined immunotherapies or chemotherapy. 
Certainty of evidence 
Overall, the certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to low.
Conclusions 
For people with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer with a high expression of PD‐L1 protein, immunotherapies alone or combinations of immunotherapies prolonged life compared to chemotherapy. The frequency of side effects may be lower with the use of immunotherapies alone compared to chemotherapy. The frequency of side effects may not differ between combinations of immunotherapies and chemotherapy.

10.1002-14651858.CD014201,"Background
The hallmark of severe hemophilia (A or B) is recurrent bleeding into joints and soft tissues with progressive joint damage, despite on‐demand treatment. Prophylaxis has long been used, but not universally adopted, because of medical, psychosocial, and cost controversies. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of clotting factor concentrate prophylaxis in managing previously‐treated individuals with hemophilia A or B. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. In addition, we searched MEDLINE and Embase and online trial registries. 
Most recent search of Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register: 24 February 2021.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs evaluating people with hemophilia A or hemophilia B, who were previously treated with clotting factor concentrates to manage their hemophilia. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently reviewed trials for eligibility, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. The authors used the GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
Ten trials (including 608 participants) were eligible for inclusion. Eight of the trials (477 participants) had arms comparing two or more prophylactic regimens to one another and four of the trials (n = 258) compared prophylaxis to on‐demand treatment (two trials had multiple arms and were included in both comparisons). 
Comparison of two or more prophylactic regimens 
For trials comparing one prophylaxis regimen to another, given the heterogeneity of the data, none of the data were pooled for this comparison. Considering the individual trials, three trials reported the primary outcome of joint bleeding, and none showed a dfference between dosing regimens (low‐certainty evidence). For the secondary outcome of total bleeding events, prophylaxis with a twice‐weekly regimen of FIX likely results in reduced total bleeds compared to a once‐a‐week regimen of the same dose, mean difference (MD) 11.2 (5.81 to 16.59) (one trial, 10 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
Transient low‐titer anti‐FVIII inhibitors were reported in one of the trials. Blood‐transmitted infections were not identified. Other adverse events reported include hypersensitivity, oedema, and weight gain. These were, however, rare and unrelated to study drugs (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Comparison of prophylactic and on‐demand regimens 
Four of the trials (258 participants) had arms that compared prophylaxis to on‐demand treatment. Prophylaxis may result in a large decrease in the number of joint bleeds compared to on‐demand treatment, MD ‐30.34 (95% CI ‐46.95 to ‐13.73) (two trials, 164 participants, low‐certainty evidence). One of these trials (84 participants) also reported the long‐term effects of prophylaxis versus on‐demand therapy showing improved joint function, quality of life, and pain; but no differences between groups in joint structure when assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
In one trial (84 participants) validated measures for joint health and pain assessment showed that prophylaxis likely improves joint health compared to an on‐demand regimen with an estimated change difference of 0.94 points (95% CI 0.23 to 1.65) and improves total pain scores, MD ‐17.20 (95% CI ‐27.48 to ‐6.92 (moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Two trials (131 participants) reported that prophylaxis likely results in a slight increase in adverse events, risk ratio 1.71 (1.24 to 2.37) (moderate‐certainty evidence). No inhibitor development and blood‐transmitted infections were identified. 
Overall, the certainty of the body of evidence was judged to be low because of different types of bias that could have altered the effect. 
 
Authors' conclusions
There is evidence from RCTs that prophylaxis, as compared to on‐demand treatment, may reduce bleeding frequency in previously‐treated people with hemophilia. Prophylaxis may also improve joint function, pain and quality of life, even though this does not translate into a detectable improvement of articular damage when assessed by MRI.  
When comparing two different prophylaxis regimens, no significant differences in terms of protection from bleeding were found. Dose optimization could, however, result in improved efficacy. Given the heterogeneity of the data, pooled estimates were not obtained for most comparisons.  
Well‐designed RCTs and prospective observational controlled studies with standardised definitions and measurements are needed to establish the optimal and most cost‐effective treatment regimens.

Is Regular Treatment Better Than As-Needed Treatment for Hemophilia?

### **Rationale**

Hemophilia is a rare health problem. It makes it hard for a person’s blood to clot. This means they can bleed for a long time after an injury. People with severe hemophilia can also have bleeds inside their body.

These bleeds often happen in the joints, like knees and elbows. Over time, this can cause a lot of pain. It can also cause lasting damage to the joints. This can make it hard to move and do daily tasks.

There are two main ways to treat hemophilia. One way is called “on-demand” treatment. This is when a person gets medicine only after a bleed starts. The other way is called “prophylaxis.” This is regular, preventive treatment. A person gets medicine on a set schedule to stop bleeds before they happen.

Doctors have wondered which way is better for patients. This study was done to find out. Researchers looked at past studies to compare these two types of treatment. They wanted to see if regular treatment works better to prevent bleeding and joint damage.

### **Trial Design**

This study did not have new patients. Instead, researchers did a review of studies that were already done. They looked for a specific type of study called a randomized controlled trial. In these studies, people are put into groups by chance to get different treatments. This is a fair way to compare them.

The researchers found 10 good studies to look at. In total, these studies included 608 people. All the people in the studies had hemophilia A or B. They had all received treatment for their hemophilia before.

The studies compared different treatment plans. Some studies compared regular, preventive treatment with on-demand treatment. Other studies compared different schedules of regular treatment. For example, they might compare getting medicine once a week to getting it twice a week.

### **Results**

The researchers looked at the results from the 10 studies. They found some key things. The results are split into two parts based on what the studies compared.

**Regular Treatment Compared to On-Demand Treatment**
The results showed that regular treatment was better in many ways. People who got regular treatment had many fewer bleeds in their joints. This is a big benefit.

These people also said their joints worked better. They had less pain in their daily lives. They also felt their quality of life was better. Quality of life means how happy and healthy a person feels.

The researchers also looked at scans of the joints. These scans did not show a difference in joint damage between the two groups. But, regular treatment did help with pain and how well the joints worked.

People on regular treatment had a slightly higher chance of side effects. These side effects were not serious. No one developed serious problems from the treatment.

**Comparing Different Schedules of Regular Treatment**
It was hard to compare the different schedules of regular treatment. This is because each study was done in a different way. The researchers could not say for sure if one schedule was better than another at stopping joint bleeds.

One small study did show a possible difference. For one type of medicine, getting it two times a week seemed to stop more bleeds than getting it once a week. But more research is needed to be sure.

**What the Researchers Concluded**
Overall, the evidence shows that regular, preventive treatment helps people with hemophilia. It leads to fewer bleeds. It can also improve joint health, lessen pain, and lead to a better quality of life.

The researchers believe that more studies are needed. Future studies can help find the best schedule for regular treatment. This will help doctors and patients choose the plan that works best and is the best value.","Regular clotting factor replacement therapy to prevent joint damage in people living with severe hemophilia A or B 
Review question 
Should people, who have previously been treated for joint bleeding, be given regular preventative treatment with clotting factor concentrates to manage their condition? 
Background 
Hemophilia A and B are X‐linked inherited bleeding disorders in which bleeding  into joints is a major problem. Repeated joint bleeds can lead to affected joints (commonly referred to as 'target joints') becoming damaged and painful, with limited movement. Currently, bleeding is treated and prevented with plasma‐derived or recombinant clotting factor concentrates, and more recently non‐clotting factor formulations. This review looked at how useful and effective different clotting factor treatment strategies are for preventing joint bleeding and other outcomes in previously treated people with hemophilia A or B. 
Search date 
Date of last search: 24 February 2021.
Study characteristics 
This review includes 10 randomised controlled trials. Eight had treatment arms that compared the regular use of clotting factor concentrates to prevent joint bleeds with different dosing schemes to identify regimens that may be better; four had treatment arms that compared the regular use of factor concentrates to prevent bleeds to their 'on demand' use to treat bleeds once they occur (two trials had multiple arms and were included in both comparisons). 
Key results 
In people living with hemophilia A or B previously treated for joint bleeding or with existing joint damage, preventive therapy may reduce the number of joint bleeds compared to 'on‐demand therapy'. This reduction in bleeds may lead to an improvement in joint function, pain, and quality of life. However, preventive therapy is linked to an increased use of factor concentrates and therefore higher treatment costs. Further studies are needed to establish the best preventive course of treatment in terms of starting time, frequency and dose level. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Overall, the certainty of the evidence was judged to be low because of different types of bias that could have affected the results. Future research might have an important role in changing our confidence in these results.

10.1002-14651858.CD013191,"Background
Early accurate detection of all skin cancer types is important to guide appropriate management and improve morbidity and survival. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is usually a localised skin cancer but with potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue, whereas cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and melanoma are higher risk skin cancers with the potential to metastasise and ultimately lead to death. When used in conjunction with clinical or dermoscopic suspicion of malignancy, or both, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) may help to identify cancers eligible for non‐surgical treatment without the need for a diagnostic biopsy, particularly in people with suspected BCC. Any potential benefit must be balanced against the risk of any misdiagnoses. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of RCM for the detection of BCC, cSCC, or any skin cancer in adults with any suspicious lesion and lesions that are difficult to diagnose (equivocal); and to compare its accuracy with that of usual practice (visual inspection or dermoscopy, or both). 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Studies of any design that evaluated the accuracy of RCM alone, or RCM in comparison to visual inspection or dermoscopy, or both, in adults with lesions suspicious for skin cancer compared with a reference standard of either histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up, or both. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). We contacted authors of included studies where information related to the target condition or diagnostic threshold were missing. We estimated summary sensitivities and specificities using the bivariate hierarchical model. For computation of likely numbers of true‐positive, false‐positive, false‐negative, and true‐negative findings in the 'Summary of findings' tables, we applied summary sensitivity and specificity estimates to lower quartile, median and upper quartiles of the prevalence observed in the study groups. We also investigated the impact of observer experience. 
Main results
The review included 10 studies reporting on 11 study cohorts. All 11 cohorts reported data for the detection of BCC, including 2037 lesions (464 with BCC); and four cohorts reported data for the detection of cSCC, including 834 lesions (71 with cSCC). Only one study also reported data for the detection of BCC or cSCC using dermoscopy, limiting comparisons between RCM and dermoscopy. Studies were at high or unclear risk of bias across almost all methodological quality domains, and were of high or unclear concern regarding applicability of the evidence. Selective participant recruitment, unclear blinding of the reference test, and exclusions due to image quality or technical difficulties were observed. It was unclear whether studies were representative of populations eligible for testing with RCM, and test interpretation was often undertaken using images, remotely from the participant and the interpreter blinded to clinical information that would normally be available in practice. 
Meta‐analysis found RCM to be more sensitive but less specific for the detection of BCC in studies of participants with equivocal lesions (sensitivity 94%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 79% to 98%; specificity 85%, 95% CI 72% to 92%; 3 studies) compared to studies that included any suspicious lesion (sensitivity 76%, 95% CI 45% to 92%; specificity 95%, 95% CI 66% to 99%; 4 studies), although CIs were wide. At the median prevalence of disease of 12.5% observed in studies including any suspicious lesion, applying these results to a hypothetical population of 1000 lesions results in 30 BCCs missed with 44 false‐positive results (lesions misdiagnosed as BCCs). At the median prevalence of disease of 15% observed in studies of equivocal lesions, nine BCCs would be missed with 128 false‐positive results in a population of 1000 lesions. Across both sets of studies, up to 15% of these false‐positive lesions were observed to be melanomas mistaken for BCCs. There was some suggestion of higher sensitivities in studies with more experienced observers. Summary sensitivity and specificity could not be estimated for the detection of cSCC due to paucity of data. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence for the use of RCM for the diagnosis of BCC or cSCC in either population group. A possible role for RCM in clinical practice is as a tool to avoid diagnostic biopsies in lesions with a relatively high clinical suspicion of BCC. The potential for, and consequences of, misclassification of other skin cancers such as melanoma as BCCs requires further research. Importantly, data are lacking that compare RCM to standard clinical practice (with or without dermoscopy).

### **Plain Title**

Can a Special Microscope Help Find Skin Cancer?

### **Rationale**

It is important to find skin cancer early. Finding it early helps doctors treat it and helps patients get better. There are a few types of skin cancer. Basal cell carcinoma, or BCC, is a very common type. It usually stays in one spot on the skin.

Other types, like squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and melanoma, are more serious. These types can spread to other parts of the body. This can be very dangerous.

Doctors have tools to check for skin cancer. One tool is a special microscope that can look under the skin without cutting it. This is called reflectance confocal microscopy, or RCM. Researchers wanted to know if this RCM tool is good at finding skin cancer.

This study was done to see how well the RCM tool works. They wanted to know if it could help people avoid having a piece of skin removed for testing. This is called a biopsy. They also wanted to see if it was as good as the tools doctors use now.

### **Trial Design**

This study was a review. This means the researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they gathered the results from 10 older studies that had already been completed. Putting the results of many studies together can give a stronger answer.

The older studies included adults who had a spot on their skin. Doctors thought these spots might be skin cancer. Some of the spots were very hard for doctors to be sure about.

The researchers looked at how well the RCM tool worked in these past studies. They compared its results to the results from a lab test. A lab test is the surest way to know if a spot is cancer.

### **Results**

The researchers found there was not enough proof to say that the RCM tool should be used to find skin cancer. Many of the older studies they looked at had some problems. This made it hard to be sure about the results.

The RCM tool was tested for finding the common skin cancer called BCC. The tool was good at finding BCC when it was really there. But it often made mistakes. It would sometimes say a spot was cancer when it was not.

For example, think of a group of 1000 people with a hard-to-diagnose skin spot. If doctors used the RCM tool, it might miss 9 real cancers. At the same time, it might wrongly tell 128 people that they have cancer when they do not.

The most serious problem was the type of mistakes the RCM tool made. Sometimes, the tool would identify a spot as the common BCC. But the spot was actually a melanoma, which is a much more dangerous skin cancer. This is a very big risk for patients.

There was not enough information to know if the RCM tool works for finding cSCC skin cancer. The researchers concluded that more studies are needed. We need to be sure this tool is safe and better than the tools doctors already use.","What is the diagnostic accuracy of reflectance confocal microscopy for the detection of basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin in adults? 
What is the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is on its own or compared to inspection of a skin lesion with the naked eye alone or using a hand‐held microscope called dermoscopy for diagnosing two common forms of keratinocyte skin cancer: basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) in adults. Review authors in Cochrane included 10 studies to answer this question. 
Why is improving the diagnosis of BCC or cSCC important? 
There are a number of different types of skin cancer. BCC and cSCC are usually localised skin cancers. Making the correct diagnosis is important because mistaking one skin cancer for another can lead to the wrong treatment being used or lead to a delay in effective treatment. A missed diagnosis of BCC (known as a false‐negative result) can result in the missed BCC growing and causing disfigurement. A missed diagnosis of cSCC is more serious as it could spread to other parts of the body. Diagnosing a skin cancer when it is not actually present (a false‐positive result) may result in unnecessary biopsy or treatment and can cause discomfort and worry to patients. 
What was studied in the review? 
Microscopic techniques are used by skin cancer specialists to provide a more detailed, magnified examination of suspicious skin lesions than can be achieved using the naked eye alone. Currently, dermoscopy is used by doctors as part of the examination of suspicious skin lesions. RCM is a new microscopic technique to increase the magnification. It is a hand‐held device or static unit using infrared light that can visualise deeper layers of the skin when compared with dermoscopy. Both techniques are painless procedures, but RCM is more expensive, time consuming, and requires additional specialised training. Dermoscopy can be used by general practitioners (GP) whereas RCM is likely to only be used by hospital specialists for people who have been referred with a skin lesion that is suspected to be a skin cancer. We wanted to see if RCM should be used instead of, or as well as, inspection of a skin lesion with the naked eye alone or using dermoscopy to diagnose BCC or cSCC. The accuracy of the test was looked at when used on people with any suspicious skin lesion and also in people with skin lesions that were tricky to diagnose. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found 10 studies that included information on 11 groups of people with lesions suspicious for skin cancer. The main results were based on seven of the 11 sets of data: four in any lesion suspicious for skin cancer and three in particularly difficult to diagnose skin lesions. 
For the comparison of RCM versus dermoscopy, we found four sets of data that included 912 suspicious skin lesions. The results suggested that in a group of 1000 people with any suspicious lesion, of whom 125 (12.5%) really do have BCC: 
‐ an estimated 139 people will have an RCM result indicating BCC is present;
‐ of these, 44 (32%) people will not have BCC (false‐positive results) including one person with a melanoma mistaken for a BCC; 
‐ of the 861 people with an RCM result indicating that BCC is not present, 30 (3%) will actually have BCC. 
The review also included three sets of data on people that had 668 particularly difficult to diagnose skin lesions, one comparing RCM to dermoscopy. The results suggested that if RCM was to be used by skin specialists in a group of 1000 people, of whom 150 (15%) really do have BCC: 
‐ an estimated 269 people will have an RCM result indicating BCC is present;
‐ of these, 128 (48%) people will not have a BCC (known as a false‐positive result), including as many as 19 people with melanomas mistaken for BCCs; 
‐ of the 732 people with an RCM result indicating that BCC is not present, nine (1%) will actually have BCC. 
There was not enough evidence to determine the accuracy of RCM for the detection of cSCC in either population group. 
How reliable are the results of this review? 
There was a lot of variation in the results of the studies in this review. Poor reporting of study conduct made assessment of the reliability of studies difficult. It was unclear whether studies were representative of populations eligible for testing with RCM, and test interpretation was often undertaken using images, remotely from the patient and the interpreter blinded to clinical information that would normally be available in practice. Only one study compared the accuracy of dermoscopy and RCM. Most studies were conducted by specialist research teams with high levels of training and experience with RCM, meaning that RCM may appear better than it would be when used in everyday practice. Most studies reported diagnosis based on observers' subjective views, which might not be the same for people using the technique in everyday practice. In nine studies, the diagnosis of skin cancer was made by a skin biopsy or by following up those people over time to make sure they remained negative for skin cancer*. This is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether patients really had skin cancer. In one study, the absence of skin cancer was made by experts looking at the skin, a method that may be less reliable for deciding whether patients really had skin cancer. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Five studies were carried out in Europe (61%), and the rest in Asia, Oceania, North America, or more than one continent. The average ages of people who took part ranged from 41 to 65 years. The percentage of people with BCC in these studies ranged from 6% to 83% (a middle value of 12% for any suspicious lesion and 15% for difficult to diagnose skin lesions). For studies of RCM used for cSCC, the percentage of people with cSCC ranged between 4% and 13%. In many studies it was not clear what tests people taking part had received before RCM. 
What are the implications of this review? 
There was not enough good evidence to support the use of RCM for the diagnosis of BCC or cSCC outside of research studies. There was a lot of variation and uncertainty in results and in the ways studies were carried out, reducing the reliability of findings. Using RCM might avoid the need for a diagnostic biopsy in people who see a doctor with a high suspicion of a BCC lesion, but more research is needed to confirm this. Such research should compare RCM to dermoscopy in well‐described groups of people with suspicious skin lesions and they must say whether other skin cancers end up being missed or being wrongly classified as BCC. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies, biopsy or clinical follow‐up were the reference standards (means of establishing final diagnoses).

10.1002-14651858.CD005293.pub2,"Treatments for accidental damage during surgery to the nerves supplying sensation to the tongue, lower lip and chin 
Review question 
The main question addressed by this review is how effective are different treatments and what are the best timings for these treatments following accidental damage during surgery to the nerves that supply sensation to the tongue, lower lip and chin. 
Background 
The nerves (alveolar and lingual) supplying sensation to the tongue, lower lip and chin, may be injured as a result of surgical treatments to the mouth and face, including surgery to remove lower wisdom teeth. The vast majority (90%) of these injuries are temporary and get better within eight weeks. However if they last for longer than six months they are considered to be permanent. Damage to these nerves can lead to altered sensation in the region of the lower lip and chin, or tongue or both. Furthermore, damage to the nerve supplying the tongue may lead to altered taste perception. These injuries can affect people's quality of life leading to emotional problems, problems with socialising and disabilities. Accidental injury after surgery can also give rise to legal action. 
There are many interventions or treatments available, surgical and non‐surgical, that may enhance recovery, including improving sensation. They can be grouped as. 
1. Surgical – a variety of procedures. 2. Laser treatment – low‐level laser treatment has been used to treat partial loss of sensation. 3. Medical – treatment with drugs including antiepileptics, antidepressants and painkillers. 4. Counselling – including cognitive behavioural and relaxation therapy, changing behaviour and hypnosis. 
Study characteristics 
The Cochrane Oral Health Group carried out this review, and the evidence is current as of 9 October 2013. There are two studies included, both published in 1996, which compared low‐level laser treatment to placebo or fake treatment for partial loss of sensation following surgery to the lower jaw. There were 15 participants in one study and 16 in the other, their ages ranging from 17 to 55 years. All had suffered accidental damage to nerves of the lower jaw and tongue causing some loss of sensation following surgery. 
Key results 
Low‐level laser therapy was the only treatment to be evaluated in the included studies and this was compared to fake or placebo laser therapy. No studies were found that evaluated other surgical, medical or counselling treatments. 
There was some evidence of an improvement when participants reported whether or not sensation was better in the lip and chin areas with low‐level laser therapy. This is based on the results of a single, small study, so the results should be interpreted with caution. 
No studies reported on the effects of the treatment on other outcomes such as pain, difficulty eating or speaking or taste. No studies reported on quality of life or harm. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall quality of the evidence is very low as a result of limitations in the conduct and reporting of the two included studies and the low number of participants, and evidence from participants with only partial sensory loss.

A Review of Treatments for Nerve Damage After Mouth Surgery

**Rationale**
Sometimes, surgery in your mouth can hurt the nerves. This can happen when you get your wisdom teeth taken out. These nerves help you feel your tongue, lower lip, and chin.

When a nerve is hurt, that part of your mouth may feel numb or tingly. For most people, this feeling goes away in a few weeks. About 9 out of 10 people get better on their own. But if the problem lasts for more than six months, the damage may not go away. This can make it hard to eat, talk, or drink. It can also make a person feel sad or have problems in social situations.

Doctors have a few ways to treat this nerve damage. These include more surgery, special medicines, low-level laser therapy, and counseling. We wanted to know which treatment works best. This study reviewed the research to find the safest and most helpful treatments for patients with this type of nerve damage.

**Trial Design**
This was a review study. This means the researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they searched for and looked at studies that were already done. The goal was to bring all the results together to find the best answer.

The researchers found only two small studies that fit their search. Both studies were from 1996. One study had 15 people in it, and the other had 16. The people in the studies were between 17 and 55 years old. All of them had nerve damage with some loss of feeling after mouth surgery.

The two studies looked at low-level laser treatment. Some people got the real laser treatment. Other people got a fake laser treatment. The fake treatment is called a placebo. It does not do anything. This helps researchers see if the real treatment truly works.

**Results**
The review found that only one type of treatment has been studied in this way. This was low-level laser therapy. The researchers did not find any studies about surgery, medicine, or counseling for this problem.

There was some weak proof that the laser therapy might help. In one of the small studies, some people who got the laser treatment said the feeling in their lip and chin got better.

But we need to be very careful with these results. The study was very small. Because so few people were in the study, we cannot be sure if the laser was the real reason they felt better. The researchers who did the review said the quality of the proof was very low. This was due to the small size of the studies and problems in how they were done.

The studies also did not report on other important things. They did not say if the treatment helped with pain. They did not say if it made it easier to eat or speak. They also did not mention any side effects or harm from the treatment. More and better research is needed to find the best way to treat this kind of nerve damage.","Treatments for accidental damage during surgery to the nerves supplying sensation to the tongue, lower lip and chin

All had suffered accidental damage to nerves of the lower jaw and tongue causing some loss of sensation following surgery. 
Key results 
Low‐level laser therapy was the only treatment to be evaluated in the included studies and this was compared to fake or placebo laser therapy. No studies were found that evaluated other surgical, medical or counselling treatments. 
There was some evidence of an improvement when participants reported whether or not sensation was better in the lip and chin areas with low‐level laser therapy. This is based on the results of a single, small study, so the results should be interpreted with caution. 
No studies reported on the effects of the treatment on other outcomes such as pain, difficulty eating or speaking or taste. No studies reported on quality of life or harm. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall quality of the evidence is very low as a result of limitations in the conduct and reporting of the two included studies and the low number of participants, and evidence from participants with only partial sensory loss.

Primary malignant brain tumours can have an unpredictable course, but high‐grade gliomas typically have a relentlessly progressive disease trajectory. They can cause profound symptom burden, affecting physical, neurocognitive, and social functioning from an early stage in the illness. This can significantly impact on role function and on the experiences and needs of informal caregivers. Access to specialist palliative and supportive care early in the disease trajectory, for those with high‐grade tumours in particular, has the potential to improve patients' and caregivers' quality of life. However, provision of palliative and supportive care for people with primary brain tumours ‐ and their informal caregivers ‐ is historically ill‐defined and ad hoc, and the benefits of early palliative interventions have not been confirmed. It is therefore important to define the role and effectiveness of early referral to specialist palliative care services and/or the effectiveness of other interventions focused on palliating disease impact on people and their informal caregivers. This would help guide improvement to service provision, by defining those interventions which are effective across a range of domains, and developing an evidence‐based model of integrated supportive and palliative care for this population. 
Objectives
To assess the evidence base for early palliative care interventions, including referral to specialist palliative care services compared to usual care, for improving outcomes in adults diagnosed with a primary brain tumour and their carers. 
Search methods
We conducted searches of electronic databases, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and PsycINFO (last searched 16 November 2021). We conducted searches to incorporate both qualitative and quantitative search terms. In addition to this, we searched for any currently recruiting trials in ClinicalTrials.gov and in the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal, and undertook citation tracking via Scopus. We also handsearched reference lists of potentially eligible systematic review articles to identify any other relevant studies, contacted experts in the field and searched key authors via Web of Science and searched SIGLE (System of Information on Grey Literature in Europe). 
Selection criteria
We included studies looking at early referral to specialist palliative care services ‐ or early targeted palliative interventions by other healthcare professionals ‐ for improving quality of life, symptom control, psychological outcomes, or overall survival as a primary or secondary outcome measure. Studies included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non‐randomised studies (NRS), as well as qualitative and mixed‐methods studies where both qualitative and quantitative data were included. Participants were adults with a confirmed radiological and/or histological diagnosis of a primary malignant brain tumour, and/or informal adult carers (either at individual or family level) of people with a primary malignant brain tumour. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodological procedures for data extraction, management, and analysis. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for symptom control, i.e. cognitive function. 
Main results
We identified 9748 references from the searches, with 8337 remaining after duplicates were removed. After full‐text review, we included one trial. There were no studies of early specialist palliative care interventions or of early, co‐ordinated generalist palliative care approaches. 
The included randomised trial addressed a single symptom area, focusing on early cognitive rehabilitation, administered within two weeks of surgery in a mixed brain tumour population, of whom approximately half had a high‐grade glioma. The intervention was administered individually as therapist‐led computerised exercises over 16 one‐hour sessions, four times/week for four weeks. Sessions addressed several cognitive domains including time orientation, spatial orientation, visual attention, logical reasoning, memory, and executive function. 
There were no between‐group differences in outcome for tests of logical‐executive function, but differences were observed in the domains of visual attention and verbal memory. Risk of bias was assessed and stated as high for performance bias and attrition bias but for selective reporting it was unclear whether all outcomes were reported. We considered the certainty of the evidence, as assessed by GRADE, to be very low. 
Authors' conclusions
Currently there is a lack of research focusing on the introduction of early palliative interventions specifically for people with primary brain tumours, either as co‐ordinated specialist palliative care approaches or interventions focusing on a specific aspect of palliation. Future research should address the methodological shortcomings described in early palliative intervention studies in other cancers and chronic conditions. In particular, the specific population under investigation, the timing and the setting of the intervention should be clearly described and the standardised palliative care‐specific components of the intervention should be defined in detail.

Does Early Support Help People with Brain Tumors? A Review of the Research

**Rationale**

**What is the health problem?**
Some brain tumors are very serious and grow over time. These tumors can cause many problems for a person. They can affect how you move, think, and feel. This can make daily life very hard. It can also be a heavy burden for family and friends who care for you.

**What is supportive care?**
There is a special type of care that can help. It is called palliative care or supportive care. This is not a cure for the tumor. Instead, its goal is to make you feel as comfortable as possible. This care helps manage pain and other symptoms. It also offers emotional and spiritual support for you and your family.

**Why was this review needed?**
Doctors believe that getting this supportive care early might help people with brain tumors have a better quality of life. But there has not been a lot of research to prove this. We do not know for sure what kind of support works best or when it should start.

Researchers did this review to find all the studies that have been done on this topic. They wanted to see if there is good proof that early supportive care helps people with brain tumors and their caregivers.

**Trial Design**

**How did the researchers look for answers?**
This was not a study with new patients. Instead, the researchers looked for studies that were already finished. This is called a systematic review. They wanted to gather all the information in one place.

The research team searched for studies in many large medical databases online. They looked for both finished studies and trials that are happening now. They also read the lists of sources in other review articles. They even contacted experts in the field to make sure they did not miss any studies.

**What kind of studies were they looking for?**
The researchers looked for any study about early supportive care for adults with a brain tumor. The care could be from a special team or from other health workers. The studies had to include adults who were told by a doctor that they have a brain tumor. They also looked for studies that included the adult family members who care for them.

The goal was to find studies that measured if early care helped improve a person's quality of life. They also looked for better symptom control, less stress, or a longer life.

**Results**

**What were the main results of this review?**
The researchers found thousands of articles in their search. After a careful review, they found only one study that matched what they were looking for. This main result shows that there is very little research on early supportive care for people with brain tumors.

**What did the one study look at?**
The one study they found was not about general supportive care. It focused on just one type of problem: trouble with thinking and memory. The study tested a program of brain exercises to help with these problems. This is called cognitive rehabilitation.

About half of the people in that study had a serious type of brain tumor. They started the brain exercises on a computer within two weeks after their surgery. A therapist helped them. They did the exercises four times a week for four weeks.

**What did the one study find?**
The brain exercises seemed to help people with their attention and with remembering words. But the exercises did not seem to help with other thinking skills, like planning or solving problems.

The researchers who did this big review had concerns about the one study they found. They felt it had a high risk of being wrong. This means we cannot be sure about the results. They rated the proof from this single study as very low.

**What do the researchers conclude?**
The main finding is that more research is badly needed. We do not have enough proof to know if early supportive care helps people with brain tumors.

Future studies should be designed very carefully. They need to clearly describe the people in the study. They also need to explain exactly what the supportive care is and when it is given. This will help doctors and patients make better decisions about care in the future.","Improving the outcome of people with primary brain tumours and their carers using early palliative interventions 
Why this question is important 
Brain tumours can have a significant impact on people and their carers. Brain tumours can impair people's physical, neurocognitive, and social functioning, which can affect the whole family, particularly informal caregivers, who often receive inadequate support. There is evidence in other cancers that providing access to palliative support in the early stages of a person's illness can help to improve their, and their caregivers', quality of life. However, it has not been confirmed that this is the case for people with brain tumours. 
Objectives 
We aimed to assess studies that included early palliative care interventions, including referral to specialist palliative care services compared to usual care, for improving outcomes in adults diagnosed with a primary brain tumour and their carers. 
How we searched for evidence 
We searched electronic medical literature databases for studies that included a range of different types of medical trials, both published and ongoing. We handsearched the reference lists of key papers and searched for key authors of research in the area. We included adults confirmed with a primary brain tumour and informal caregivers such as relatives. 
What we found 
We could not find any trials examining the impact of specialist palliative care teams on outcomes for patients or their carers. We included one trial which focused on a single symptom area – that of cognition – in a patient group of whom about half had a high‐grade tumour. The trial randomised patients between a group receiving a structured cognitive rehabilitation intervention and a group receiving usual rehabilitation care of medications and physiotherapy. Cognitive rehabilitation consisted of supervised computer‐based exercises, lasting 45 minutes at a time, four times a week, over a four‐week period. There was no important difference between the two groups apart from some improvement in visual attention and verbal memory in those who received the cognitive rehabilitation intervention. However, we assessed the certainty of the evidence as being very low, and we could find no evidence in this or other studies on any other aspect of palliative care. 
What this means 
Not enough research has been undertaken on early palliative care interventions which support people with primary brain tumours, and their caregivers. Research is needed which examines co‐ordinated approaches to overall palliative care provision, and interventions which focus on specific aspects of palliation in this population.

Stem cell therapy (SCT) has been proposed as an alternative treatment for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), nonetheless its effectiveness remains debatable. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of SCT in adults with non‐ischaemic DCM.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Embase for relevant trials in November 2020. We also searched two clinical trials registers in May 2020. 
Selection criteria
Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing stem/progenitor cells with no cells in adults with non‐ischaemic DCM. We included co‐interventions such as the administration of stem cell mobilizing agents. Studies were classified and analysed into three categories according to the comparison intervention, which consisted of no intervention/placebo, cell mobilization with cytokines, or a different mode of SCT. 
The first two comparisons (no cells in the control group) served to assess the efficacy of SCT while the third (different mode of SCT) served to complement the review with information about safety and other information of potential utility for a better understanding of the effects of SCT. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened all references for eligibility, assessed trial quality, and extracted data. We undertook a quantitative evaluation of data using random‐effects meta‐analyses. We evaluated heterogeneity using the I² statistic. We could not explore potential effect modifiers through subgroup analyses as they were deemed uninformative due to the scarce number of trials available. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We created summary of findings tables using GRADEpro GDT. We focused our summary of findings on all‐cause mortality, safety, health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), performance status, and major adverse cardiovascular events. 
Main results
We included 13 RCTs involving 762 participants (452 cell therapy and 310 controls). Only one study was at low risk of bias in all domains. There were many shortcomings in the publications that did not allow a precise assessment of the risk of bias in many domains. Due to the nature of the intervention, the main source of potential bias was lack of blinding of participants (performance bias). Frequently, the format of the continuous data available was not ideal for use in the meta‐analysis and forced us to seek strategies for transforming data in a usable format. 
We are uncertain whether SCT reduces all‐cause mortality in people with DCM compared to no intervention/placebo (mean follow‐up 12 months) (risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 1.31; I² = 0%; studies = 7, participants = 361; very low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether SCT increases the risk of procedural complications associated with cells injection in people with DCM (data could not be pooled; studies = 7; participants = 361; very low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether SCT improves HRQoL (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.62, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.23; I² = 72%; studies = 5, participants = 272; very low‐certainty evidence) and functional capacity (6‐minute walk test) (mean difference (MD) 70.12 m, 95% CI –5.28 to 145.51; I² = 87%; studies = 5, participants = 230; very low‐certainty evidence). SCT may result in a slight functional class (New York Heart Association) improvement (data could not be pooled; studies = 6, participants = 398; low‐certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported major adverse cardiovascular events as defined in our protocol. SCT may not increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmia (data could not be pooled; studies = 8, participants = 504; low‐certainty evidence). 
When comparing SCT to cell mobilization with granulocyte‐colony stimulating factor (G‐CSF), we are uncertain whether SCT reduces all‐cause mortality (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.31; I² = 39%; studies = 3, participants = 195; very low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether SCT increases the risk of procedural complications associated with cells injection (studies = 1, participants = 60; very low‐certainty evidence). SCT may not improve HRQoL (MD 4.61 points, 95% CI –5.62 to 14.83; studies = 1, participants = 22; low‐certainty evidence). SCT may improve functional capacity (6‐minute walk test) (MD 140.14 m, 95% CI 119.51 to 160.77; I² = 0%; studies = 2, participants = 155; low‐certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported MACE as defined in our protocol or ventricular arrhythmia. 
The most commonly reported outcomes across studies were based on physiological measures of cardiac function where there were some beneficial effects suggesting potential benefits of SCT in people with non‐ischaemic DCM. However, it is unclear if this intermediate effects translates into clinical benefits for these patients. 
With regard to specific aspects related to the modality of cell therapy and its delivery, uncertainties remain as subgroup analyses could not be performed as planned, making it necessary to wait for the publication of several studies that are currently in progress before any firm conclusion can be reached. 
Authors' conclusions
We are uncertain whether SCT in people with DCM reduces the risk of all‐cause mortality and procedural complications, improves HRQoL, and performance status (exercise capacity). SCT may improve functional class (NYHA), compared to usual care (no cells). 
Similarly, when compared to G‐CSF, we are also uncertain whether SCT in people with DCM reduces the risk of all‐cause mortality although some studies within this comparison observed a favourable effect that should be interpreted with caution. SCT may not improve HRQoL but may improve to some extent performance status (exercise capacity). Very low‐quality evidence reflects uncertainty regarding procedural complications. These suggested beneficial effects of SCT, although uncertain due to the very low certainty of the evidence, are accompanied by favourable effects on some physiological measures of cardiac function. 
Presently, the most effective mode of administration of SCT and the population that could benefit the most is unclear. Therefore, it seems reasonable that use of SCT in people with DCM is limited to clinical research settings. Results of ongoing studies are likely to modify these conclusions.

A Review of Studies on Stem Cells for a Weak Heart

**Rationale**
Some people have a health problem with their heart called dilated cardiomyopathy. This condition makes the main muscle of the heart get weak and stretched out, like a worn-out rubber band. When the heart is weak, it cannot pump blood well to the rest of the body. This can make people feel very tired all the time. It can also make it hard to breathe.

Doctors want to find better treatments for this heart problem. One idea they have tested is using special cells called stem cells. Stem cells are unique because they can grow into many different types of cells in the body. For example, they can become new heart muscle cells.

The hope was that putting these stem cells into a weak heart could help repair the damage. The new cells could make the heart muscle stronger and help it pump blood better. To find out if this is true, researchers looked at past studies on this topic. This review aimed to see if stem cell treatment is safe and if it works for people with this heart condition.

**Trial Design**
How is this study designed? This was not a new study where researchers tested patients directly. Instead, they did a review. A review means they looked for and carefully studied the results from many past studies. This helps to combine all the information into one big result. It can give a clearer picture than just one small study.

The researchers found 13 studies to include in their review. These studies involved a total of 762 adults. All of these adults had the type of weak heart called dilated cardiomyopathy. Their heart problem was not caused by a heart attack or blocked arteries.

The design of these 13 studies was important. In each study, some people got the real stem cell treatment. Other people got a fake treatment, which is called a placebo. Sometimes, they were compared to a different drug treatment. Comparing the groups helps show if the stem cells caused any changes. The researchers in the original studies followed the patients for about a year to see what happened to their health.

**Results**
What were the main results of the study? After looking at all 13 studies together, the researchers found that the proof was not strong. It is still not clear if stem cell treatment helps people with this heart problem. The results from the studies were too uncertain to make a strong conclusion.

The researchers looked at whether the treatment helped people live longer. They could not find clear proof that it did. They also looked at whether it improved people's quality of life or made them feel better day-to-day. Again, the proof was not clear.

There were some small signs of a benefit. The treatment may have helped some people walk a little bit farther. It also may have helped improve their heart failure symptoms, but only by a small amount. When looking at safety, the researchers were not sure if the treatment caused any side effects from the procedure. It seems that the treatment may not increase the risk of serious, uneven heartbeats.

The main conclusion from the investigators is that we do not have enough good proof right now. We cannot say for sure that stem cell treatment is helpful for this heart condition. Even though some tests showed small changes in how the heart works, it is not clear if these changes are big enough to help patients feel better or live longer. The researchers said that for now, stem cell treatment for a weak heart should only be used in clinical research studies. More research is needed before this can be a regular treatment for patients.","Bone marrow cells in non‐ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy
Review question 
Are bone marrow cells safe and effective as a treatment for non‐ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)? 
Background 
DCM is a disorder of the heart muscle with heart dilation (heart muscle becomes stretched) and impaired contraction, in the absence of high blood pressure, damaged or diseased heart valves, or heart disease present at birth or related to myocardial infarction (heart attack). The current standard of treatment is based on medicines and cardiac devices. However, DCM is still one of the leading causes of heart transplantation in adults. 
Stem cells are special cells produced in the bone marrow that are able to develop into many different cell types. Giving stem cells directly into the heart muscle has been proposed as an alternative treatment to reduce or stop further deterioration in heart function in people with DCM. 
Study characteristics 
We selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing the infusion of bone marrow‐derived stem cells into the heart muscle with the usual‐care (control) treatment in people diagnosed with DCM. We searched multiple databases for trials up to 10 November 2020. 
We included 13 RCTs involving 762 participants (452 receiving stem cell therapy and 310 controls). The trials included people with severe symptoms of ischaemic (following a heart attack) and non‐ischaemic DCM. We selected only the data from non‐ischaemic DCM. 
The studies included an average of 60 people aged about 45 to 58.5 years and 50% to 89% men in each trial. Following therapy, the participants were assessed for six months to five years, with most at one year. One study declared a private funding whereas seven others had public or governmental funding, two had non‐profit funding, and four did not report this information. 
Key results 
SCT versus control: very low‐quality evidence reflects uncertainty regarding mortality, procedural complications, health‐related quality of life and exercise capacity. Low‐quality evidence suggests that SCT may slightly improve deterioration of heart function and may not increase the risk of abnormal heartbeats in people with DCM. No studies reported other relevant outcomes such as major cardiac adverse events. 
STC plus cytokine versus control: very low‐quality evidence reflects uncertainty regarding mortality. Low‐quality evidence suggests that SCT plus cytokine may not improve health‐related quality of life but may improve exercise capacity as well as some physiological measures related to cardiac function (although it is unclear to what extent these latter outcomes are associated with relevant clinical benefits for patients). Hence, the results should be interpreted with caution. Very low‐quality evidence reflects uncertainty regarding procedural complications. No studies reported major cardiac adverse events or abnormal heartbeats. 
Due to the limited number of studies we could not perform analyses to identify which specific features of SCT and clinical characteristics of patients are associated with better results. Thus, more research is needed to establish the role of SCT in the treatment of DCM and the most effective therapies. 
Quality of evidence 
The evidence in this review is of low to very low quality due to the small number of events, results not similar across studies, risk of bias, and issues with study design. Furthermore, the limitations in the reporting of most studies made it difficult to obtain and use the information to reach clearer conclusions. 
"
10.1002-14651858.CD013287.pub2,"Background
Psychosis is an illness characterised by the presence of hallucinations and delusions that can cause distress or a marked change in an individual's behaviour (e.g. social withdrawal, flat or blunted affect). A first episode of psychosis (FEP) is the first time someone experiences these symptoms that can occur at any age, but the condition is most common in late adolescence and early adulthood. This review is concerned with FEP and the early stages of a psychosis, referred to throughout this review as 'recent‐onset psychosis.' 
Specialised early intervention (SEI) teams are community mental health teams that specifically treat people who are experiencing, or have experienced, a recent‐onset psychosis. SEI teams provide a range of treatments including medication, psychotherapy, psychoeducation, educational and employment support, augmented by assertive contact with the service user and small caseloads. Treatment is time limited, usually offered for two to three years, after which service users are either discharged to primary care or transferred to a standard adult community mental health team. Evidence suggests that once SEI treatment ends, improvements may not be sustained, bringing uncertainty about the optimal duration of SEI to ensure the best long‐term outcomes. Extending SEI has been proposed as a way of providing continued intensive treatment and continuity of care, of usually up to five years, in order to a) sustain the positive initial outcomes of SEI; and b) improve the long‐term trajectory of the illness. 
Objectives
To compare extended SEI teams with treatment as usual (TAU) for people with recent‐onset psychosis.To compare extended SEI teams with standard SEI teams followed by TAU (standard SEI + TAU) for people with recent‐onset psychosis. 
Search methods
On 3 October 2018 and 22 October 2019, we searched Cochrane Schizophrenia's study‐based register of trials, including registries of clinical trials. 
Selection criteria
We selected all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing extended SEI with TAU for people with recent‐onset psychosis and all RCTs comparing extended SEI with standard SEI + TAU for people with recent‐onset psychosis. We entered trials meeting these criteria and reporting usable data as included studies. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data and appraised study quality. For binary outcomes we calculated the risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes we calculated the mean difference (MD) and their 95% CIs, or if assessment measures differed for the same construct, we calculated the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CIs. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included three RCTs, with a total 780 participants, aged 16 to 35 years. All participants met the criteria for schizophrenia spectrum disorders or affective psychoses. No trials compared extended SEI with TAU. All three trials randomly allocated people approximately two years into standard SEI to either extended SEI or standard SEI + TAU. 
The certainty of evidence for outcomes varied from low to very low. Our primary outcomes were recovery and disengagement from mental health services. No trials reported on recovery, and we used remission as a proxy. 
Three trials reported on remission, with the point estimate suggesting a 13% increase in remission in favour of extended SEI, but this included wide confidence intervals (CIs) and a very uncertain estimate of no benefit (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.31; 3 trials, 780 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Two trials provided data on disengagement from services with evidence that extended SEI care may result in fewer disengagements from mental health treatment (15%) in comparison to standard SEI + TAU (34%) (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.75; 2 trials, 380 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
There may be no evidence of a difference in rates of psychiatric hospital admission (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.68 to 3.52; 1 trial, 160 participants; low‐certainty evidence), or the number of days spent in a psychiatric hospital (MD ‐2.70, 95% CI ‐8.30 to 2.90; 1 trial, 400 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
One trial found uncertain evidence regarding lower global psychotic symptoms in extended SEI in comparison to standard SEI + TAU (MD ‐1.90, 95% CI ‐3.28 to ‐0.52; 1 trial, 156 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
It was uncertain whether the use of extended SEI over standard SEI + TAU resulted in fewer deaths due to all‐cause mortality, as so few deaths were recorded in trials (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.64; 3 trials, 780 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Very uncertain evidence suggests that using extended SEI instead of standard SEI + TAU may not improve global functioning (SMD 0.23, 95% CI ‐0.29 to 0.76; 2 trials, 560 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
There was low risk of bias in all three trials for random sequence generation, allocation concealment and other biases. All three trials had high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel due to the nature of the intervention. For the risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessments and incomplete outcome data there was at least one trial with high or unclear risk of bias. 
Authors' conclusions
There may be preliminary evidence of benefit from extending SEI team care for treating people experiencing psychosis, with fewer people disengaging from mental health services. Evidence regarding other outcomes was uncertain. The certainty of evidence for the measured outcomes was low or very low. 
Further, suitably powered studies that use a consistent approach to outcome selection are needed, but with only one further ongoing trial, there is unlikely to be any definitive conclusion for the effectiveness of extended SEI for at least the next few years.

Does Longer Mental Health Care Help Young People with a First Episode of Psychosis?

### **Rationale**

**What is psychosis?**
Psychosis is a mental health problem. It can make a person see or hear things that are not there. A person with psychosis might also believe things that are not true. This can be very scary. It can also cause a big change in how a person acts. For example, they may want to be alone more often.

**What is a first episode of psychosis?**
The first time someone has these symptoms is called a ""first episode of psychosis."" It can happen at any age. But it is most common in older teenagers and young adults. This can be a very hard time for them and their families.

**How is it treated now?**
There are special health teams to help people who have just started to have psychosis. These teams are called Specialised Early Intervention, or SEI teams. They give focused care for about two or three years. This care includes medicine, talking with a therapist, and help with school or getting a job.

**Why was this study done?**
This special care helps people a lot when they first get it. But when the care stops, some of the good effects might not last. Researchers wanted to know if getting this special care for a longer time would help more. The main question was: could longer care help people stay well for a longer time?

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**
This was not a new study with its own patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results from three past studies. This is called a review. It helps to bring all the information together in one place to get a better overall picture. The studies they looked at were a special type where people are put into groups by chance to compare treatments.

**Who was in the studies?**
The three studies included a total of 780 people. The people in the studies were between 16 and 35 years old. All of them had recently started to have symptoms of psychosis.

**What did the studies compare?**
In these studies, everyone first got the special SEI care for about two years. After that, they were put into one of two groups by chance. One group continued to get the special SEI care for a longer time, for up to five years. The other group stopped the special SEI care. They started getting the usual care from their family doctor or a standard mental health team.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**
The researchers found that getting special care for a longer time may help people stay in treatment. People who got the longer care were less likely to stop going to their health appointments. Staying in treatment is very important for getting and staying well.

**How many people stayed in treatment?**
In the group that got longer care, about 15 out of 100 people stopped their treatment. In the group that got the standard care, about 34 out of 100 people stopped their treatment. This means that more people continued to get help when the special care lasted longer.

**Did symptoms get better?**
The researchers also looked to see if the symptoms of psychosis got better. There was a small sign that longer care might help reduce symptoms. But the researchers were not very sure about this finding. The evidence was not strong enough to be certain.

**What did the researchers conclude?**
The researchers who did this review think that giving special care for a longer time may be helpful. The main benefit they found is that it helps people stay connected with their health team. However, they are not yet sure about other benefits, like improving symptoms or daily life. The evidence they found was not very strong. More and better studies are needed to know for sure how much longer care can help young people with psychosis.","Is extending the treatment time by specialist mental health teams better for people with recent‐onset psychosis? 
What is psychosis? 
Psychosis describes conditions affecting the mind, in which people have trouble distinguishing what is real from what is not real. This might involve seeing or hearing things that other people cannot see or hear (hallucinations), or believing things that are not true (delusions). The combination of hallucinations and delusional thinking can cause severe distress and a change in behaviour. A first episode psychosis is the first time a person experiences an episode of psychosis. Recent‐onset psychosis is the first few years of the illness after someone experiences it for the first time. 
Psychosis is treatable 
Many people recover from a first episode and never experience another psychotic episode.
Early intervention teams specialise in treating recent‐onset psychosis, and aim to treat psychosis as quickly and intensively as possible. Intensive, early treatment of psychosis may help more people to continue with their treatment and to recover. 
Early intervention treatment usually lasts for two or three years. After early intervention treatment, a person will be cared for by their doctor or by standard community mental health professionals. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out if longer treatment (for up to 5 years) by specialist early intervention teams was more successful at treating recent‐onset psychosis than the usual two or three years of treatment followed by treatment by non‐specialist teams. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at the use of longer treatment of recent‐onset psychosis by specialist early intervention teams. 
We looked for randomised controlled studies, in which the treatments people received were decided at random. This type of study usually gives the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. 
We wanted to find out, at the end of the treatment:
‐ how many people recovered;
‐ how many people stopped their treatment too soon;
‐ how many people were admitted to a psychiatric hospital, and for how long;
‐ people's psychotic symptoms and functioning (how well they cope with daily life); and 
‐ how many people died.
Search date: we included evidence published up to 22 October 2019. 
What we found 
We found three studies conducted in Denmark, Canada and Hong Kong in 780 people (55% men; average age 20 to 25 years). 
The studies compared longer treatment (up to 5 years) with standard treatment (up to 3 years) by an early intervention team followed by treatment as usual (by their doctor or community mental health professionals). 
What are the results of our review? 
We found no difference between standard treatment and longer treatment by an early intervention team in the numbers of people who recovered (assessed by remission of symptoms; 3 studies; 780 people). 
Fewer people may stop their treatment too soon during longer treatment than standard treatment (2 studies; 380 people). 
There may be no difference between standard treatment and longer treatment for how many people are admitted to a psychiatric hospital (1 study; 160 people), or for how long they stay in hospital (1 study; 400 people). 
Longer treatment may reduce psychotic symptoms more than standard treatment (1 study; 156 people); but may not improve people's functioning (2 studies; 560 people). 
We are uncertain about whether longer treatment reduces the number of people who died, compared with standard treatment, because so few deaths were reported in the studies (3 studies; 780 people). 
How reliable are these results? 
Our results are likely to change when more evidence becomes available. We are not confident that longer treatment affects how many people stop treatment too soon, how many are admitted to hospital and how long they stay in hospital. 
We are uncertain about the effect of longer treatment on how many people recover, people's psychotic symptoms and functioning, and on the number of people who die. These results will change when more evidence becomes available. 
Key messages 
Longer treatment of recent‐onset psychosis by specialist mental health teams may lead to fewer people stopping their treatment early. However, we need more evidence before we can be certain about whether longer treatment is better overall than the usual two‐ or three‐year treatment.

Systemic corticosteroids are used to treat people with COVID‐19 because they counter hyper‐inflammation. Existing evidence syntheses suggest a slight benefit on mortality. So far, systemic corticosteroids are one of the few treatment options for COVID‐19. Nonetheless, size of effect, certainty of the evidence, optimal therapy regimen, and selection of patients who are likely to benefit most are factors that remain to be evaluated. 
Objectives
To assess whether systemic corticosteroids are effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID‐19, and to keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review approach. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register (which includes PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and medRxiv), Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Emerging Citation Index), and the WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies to 16 April 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids for people with COVID‐19, irrespective of disease severity, participant age, gender or ethnicity.  
We included any type or dose of systemic corticosteroids. We included the following comparisons: systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care (plus/minus placebo), dose comparisons, timing comparisons (early versus late), different types of corticosteroids and systemic corticosteroids versus other active substances.  
We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome), corticosteroids in combination with other active substances versus standard care, topical or inhaled corticosteroids, and corticosteroids for long‐COVID treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess the risk of bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' 2 tool for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: all‐cause mortality, ventilator‐free days, new need for invasive mechanical ventilation, quality of life, serious adverse events, adverse events, and hospital‐acquired infections. 
Main results
We included 11 RCTs in 8075 participants, of whom 7041 (87%) originated from high‐income countries. A total of 3072 participants were randomised to corticosteroid arms and the majority received dexamethasone (n = 2322). We also identified 42 ongoing studies and 16 studies reported as being completed or terminated in a study registry, but without results yet.  
Hospitalised individuals with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of symptomatic COVID‐19 
Systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care plus/minus placebo  
We included 10 RCTs (7989 participants), one of which did not report any of our pre‐specified outcomes and thus our analysis included outcome data from nine studies.  
All‐cause mortality (at longest follow‐up available): systemic corticosteroids plus standard care probably reduce all‐cause mortality slightly in people with COVID‐19 compared to standard care alone (median 28 days: risk difference of 30 in 1000 participants fewer than the control group rate of 275 in 1000 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.00; 9 RCTs, 7930 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
Ventilator‐free days: corticosteroids may increase ventilator‐free days (MD 2.6 days more than control group rate of 4 days, 95% CI 0.67 to 4.53; 1 RCT, 299 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Ventilator‐free days have inherent limitations as a composite endpoint and should be interpreted with caution.  
New need for invasive ventilation: the evidence is of very low certainty. Because of high risk of bias arising from deaths that occurred before ventilation we are uncertain about the size and direction of the effects. Consequently, we did not perform analysis beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics.  
Quality of life/neurological outcome: no data were available. 
Serious adverse events: we included data on two RCTs (678 participants) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids compared to standard care (plus/minus placebo); for adverse events and hospital‐acquired infections, we included data on five RCTs (660 participants). Because of high risk of bias, heterogeneous definitions, and underreporting we are uncertain about the size and direction of the effects. Consequently, we did not perform analysis beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics (very low‐certainty evidence).    
Different types, dosages or timing of systemic corticosteroids   
We identified one study that compared methylprednisolone with dexamethasone. The evidence for mortality and new need for invasive mechanical ventilation is very low certainty due to the small number of participants (n = 86). No data were available for the other outcomes. 
We did not identify comparisons of different dosages or timing.
Outpatients with asymptomatic or mild disease 
Currently, there are no studies published in populations with asymptomatic infection or mild disease. 
Authors' conclusions
Moderate‐certainty evidence shows that systemic corticosteroids probably slightly reduce all‐cause mortality in people hospitalised because of symptomatic COVID‐19. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that there may also be a reduction in ventilator‐free days. Since we are unable to  adjust for the impact of early death on subsequent endpoints, the findings for ventilation outcomes and harms have limited applicability to inform treatment decisions. Currently, there is no evidence for asymptomatic or mild disease (non‐hospitalised participants).  
There is an urgent need for good‐quality evidence for specific subgroups of disease severity, for which we propose level of respiratory support at randomisation. This applies to the comparison or subgroups of different types and doses of corticosteroids, too. Outcomes apart from mortality should be measured and analysed appropriately taking into account confounding through death if applicable.  
We identified 42 ongoing and 16 completed but not published RCTs in trials registries suggesting possible changes of effect estimates and certainty of the evidence in the future. Most ongoing studies target people who need respiratory support at baseline. With the living approach of this review, we will continue to update our search and include eligible trials and published data.

A Review of Studies on Steroid Medicines for COVID-19

### **Rationale**

COVID-19 is an illness that can affect the whole body. For some people, the body’s own defense system can overreact to the virus. This overreaction can cause too much swelling and irritation inside the body. This is a serious problem that can harm the lungs and other organs.

Doctors use strong medicines called corticosteroids, or steroids, to calm the body's defense system. These drugs can help reduce the harmful swelling. Early information suggested that steroids might help people with COVID-19. But doctors were not sure how much they helped. They also wanted to know which patients would benefit the most.

This review looked at the results of many studies. The main goal was to find out if steroid drugs are safe and helpful for people with COVID-19. Researchers wanted to bring all the information together to get a clear answer.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with its own patients. Instead, researchers gathered and reviewed the results from 11 other studies. This type of research is called a systematic review.

The studies they looked at were a special type called randomised controlled trials. In these studies, people are put into groups by chance. One group gets the study drug, and the other group gets the usual care. This is the best way to fairly test if a drug works.

The review included about 8,000 people who were in the hospital with COVID-19. They were men and women of all ages. Most of the people lived in high-income countries. The studies followed the patients for about one month to see what happened to them.

### **Results**

The main goal was to see if steroids helped people live. The review found that steroid drugs probably do help save lives for people in the hospital with COVID-19.

Here is what the numbers show. Imagine a group of 1000 people with COVID-19 in the hospital who did not get steroids. In that group, about 275 people died. Now, imagine a group of 1000 people who did get steroids. In that group, about 30 fewer people died.

Researchers also looked at whether steroids helped people breathe on their own. Some people with COVID-19 need a machine called a ventilator to help them breathe. The review found that people who got steroids may have had more days without needing a ventilator. But the researchers were not very sure about this finding.

The review also tried to look at the side effects, or bad things, that the drugs might cause. The studies did not report this information very well. Because of this, the researchers could not be sure about the risk of side effects from steroids. They also did not find any studies about using steroids for people with mild COVID-19 who were not in the hospital.

The people who did this review concluded that steroids are a helpful treatment for people who are sick enough with COVID-19 to be in the hospital. Steroids probably help a small number of these people survive. More studies are needed to understand the side effects and to find out the best way to use these drugs.","Are corticosteroids (anti‐inflammatory medicines) given orally or by injection an effective treatment for people with COVID‐19? 
Key messages 
• Corticosteroids (anti‐inflammatory medicines) given orally or by injection (systemic) are probably effective treatments for people hospitalised with COVID‐19. We don’t know whether they cause unwanted effects.  
• We don’t know which systemic corticosteroid is the most effective. We found no evidence about people without symptoms or with mild COVID‐19 who were not hospitalised.  
• We found 42 ongoing studies and 16 completed studies that have not published their results. We will update this review when we find new evidence.     
What are corticosteroids? 
Corticosteroids are anti‐inflammatory medicines that reduce redness and swelling. They also reduce the activity of the immune system, which defends the body against disease and infection. Corticosteroids are used to treat a variety of conditions, such as asthma, eczema, joint strains and rheumatoid arthritis.  
Systemic corticosteroids can be swallowed or given by injection to treat the whole body. High doses of corticosteroids taken over a long time may cause unwanted effects, such as increased appetite, difficulty sleeping and mood changes.  
Why are corticosteroids possible treatments for COVID‐19?  
COVID‐19 affects the lungs and airways. As the immune system fights the virus, the lungs and airways become inflamed, causing breathing difficulties. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation, so may reduce the need for breathing support with a ventilator (a machine that breathes for a patient). Some patients’ immune systems overreact to the virus causing further inflammation and tissue damage; corticosteroids may help to control this response. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether systemic corticosteroids are an effective treatment for people with COVID‐19 and whether they cause unwanted effects. 
We were interested in:
• deaths from any cause up to 14 days after treatment, or longer if reported;• whether people got better or worse after treatment, based on their need for breathing support;• quality of life;• unwanted effects and infections caught in hospital. 
What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated systemic corticosteroids for people with mild, moderate or severe COVID‐19. People could be any age, sex or ethnicity. 
Studies could compare:
• corticosteroids plus usual care versus usual care with or without placebo (sham medicine);• one corticosteroid versus another;• corticosteroids versus a different medicine;• different doses of a corticosteroid; or• early versus late treatment. 
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find?  
We found 11 studies with 8075 people. About 3000 people received corticosteroids, mostly dexamethasone (2322 people). Most studies took place in high‐income countries.  
We also found 42 ongoing studies, and 16 completed studies that have not yet published their results.  
Main results 
Ten studies compared corticosteroids plus usual care versus usual care with or without placebo. Only one study compared two corticosteroids. The studies included only hospitalised people with confirmed or suspected COVID‐19. No studies looked at non‐hospitalised people, different doses or timing, or provided information about quality of life. 
Corticosteroids plus usual care compared to usual care with or without placebo (10 studies) 
• Corticosteroids probably reduce the number of deaths from any cause slightly, up to 60 days after treatment (9 studies, 7930 people).• One study (299 people) reported that people on a ventilator at the start of the study were ventilation‐free for more days with corticosteroids than with usual care, so corticosteroids may improve people’s symptoms.• Four studies (427 people) reported whether people not on a ventilator at the start of treatment later needed to be put on a ventilator, but we could not pool the studies’ results, so we are unsure if people’s symptoms get worse with corticosteroids or usual care.• We don’t know if corticosteroids increase or reduce serious unwanted effects (2 studies, 678 people), any unwanted effects (5 studies, 660 people), or infections caught in hospital (5 studies, 660 people). 
Methylprednisolone versus dexamethasone (1 study, 86 people) 
• We don’t know whether the corticosteroid methylprednisolone reduces the number of deaths from any cause compared to dexamethasone in the 28 days after treatment.• We don’t know if methylprednisolone worsens people’s symptoms compared to dexamethasone, based on whether they needed ventilation in the 28 days after treatment.• The study did not provide information about anything else we were interested in. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We are moderately confident in the evidence about corticosteroids’ effect on deaths from any cause. However, our confidence in the other evidence is low to very low, because studies did not use the most robust methods, and the way results were recorded and reported differed across studies. We did not find any evidence on quality of life and there was no evidence from low‐income countries or on people with mild COVID‐19 or no symptoms, who were not hospitalised.  
How up to date is this evidence? 
Our evidence is up to date to 16 April 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD004019.pub4,"Osteotomy for treating knee osteoarthritis
Researchers from The Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review of the effects of an osteotomy in people with osteoarthritis of the knee. Upon searching for all relevant studies until November 2013, they found 21 studies that included up to 1065 people. Their findings are summarised below. 
This review shows that in people with osteoarthritis of the knee:
• osteotomy can improve pain and function, but this is based on changes within a treatment group. No studies compared osteotomy versus conservative treatment; and • no evidence can be found for a preferred osteotomy technique. 
What is osteoarthritis of the knee, and what is an osteotomy?  Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints, such as the knee or the hip. When the joint loses cartilage, the bone grows to try to repair the damage. Instead of making things better, however, the bone grows abnormally and makes things worse. For example, the bone can become misshapen, and this can make the joint painful and unstable. This can affect physical function or ability to use the knee. Two main types of surgery are used to treat patients with osteoarthritis of the knee: knee replacement and osteotomy. 
Osteotomy is surgery in which the bones are cut and realigned. Osteotomy around the knee changes the alignment of the knee. Weight bearing will be shifted from the diseased part to a healthy part of the knee. By 'unloading' the damaged cartilage of the knee, osteotomy may decrease pain, improve function, slow knee deterioration and possibly delay the need for (partial or) total knee replacement surgery. 
What happens to people after an osteotomy for knee osteoarthritis?  Follow‐up of all studies was too short to allow scoring of treatment failure; this refers to a revision to a knee replacement. 
In all studies, people reported less pain and improved knee function and quality of life after any type of high tibial osteotomy. However this comparison is based on differences before and after an osteotomy, not on comparison with non‐operative treatment. Probably no differences in pain and function scores are noted between different osteotomy techniques. 
Rare complications may include thromboembolism and lesions to nerves and vascular structures. 
The most important reasons for reoperation include hardware removal resulting from pain and pin track infection due to the external fixator. This reoperation rate may be higher in patients undergoing another high tibial osteotomy technique compared with those treated with the closing wedge technique. 
Two studies compared high tibial osteotomy versus partial knee replacement. Benefits did not differ between these types of surgery.

### **Plain Title**

A Look at Bone Surgery for Knee Arthritis Pain

### **Rationale**

**What is knee arthritis?**

Knee arthritis is a disease that affects the joints. Your knee joint has a soft, smooth cushion called cartilage. This cushion covers the ends of your bones and helps your knee move easily. In knee arthritis, this cushion wears away.

When the cushion is gone, the bones can rub together. To try to fix this, the bone may grow in new ways. But this new bone growth can make the joint painful and unsteady. This can make it hard to walk, climb stairs, or do daily tasks.

**Why was this study done?**

There are two main types of surgery for knee arthritis. One is a knee replacement. The other is a bone surgery called an osteotomy.

In an osteotomy, a surgeon cuts the bone near the knee and lines it up in a new way. This moves your body weight off the damaged part of the knee and onto a healthier part. This surgery may help reduce pain and make it easier to use your knee. Researchers hoped this surgery could also help people wait longer before needing a full knee replacement.

Researchers did this study to see if bone surgery really helps people with knee arthritis. They wanted to know if it lessens pain and helps people move better. They also wanted to see if one type of this surgery was better than another.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This study was a review. This means the researchers did not do a new experiment with new patients. Instead, they gathered and studied the results from many past studies that were already finished. This helps get a bigger picture of what we know.

The researchers looked for all studies on this topic up to November 2013. They found 21 studies to include in their review.

In total, these studies included 1065 men and women. All of them had pain from knee arthritis. The studies they looked at did not last long enough to know if the surgery helped people avoid a full knee replacement later on.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The researchers found that people who had bone surgery felt less pain after the surgery. They were also able to use their knee better and had a better quality of life. However, the studies only looked at how people felt before and after their own surgery. The studies did not compare people who had the surgery to people who had no surgery or other treatments like medicine.

The researchers also looked at different ways to do the bone surgery. They could not find any proof that one way was better than another for helping with pain or movement.

**How did the surgery compare to other treatments?**

Two of the studies compared this bone surgery to getting a partial knee replacement. They found that both types of surgery helped people in about the same way.

**What were the risks?**

Like all surgeries, there were some risks. In rare cases, people had problems like blood clots. Some also had damage to their nerves or the blood tubes in their legs.

Some people needed a second surgery later. The most common reason was to remove the metal plates or pins that the surgeon used to hold the bone in place. These parts sometimes caused pain or the area around them got infected.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

The researchers concluded that bone surgery can help reduce pain and make it easier for people with knee arthritis to use their knee. However, we need more studies that compare this surgery to treatments that are not surgery, like physical therapy. This will help us know for sure how well the surgery works.","Osteotomy for treating knee osteoarthritis

10.1002-14651858.CD013732.pub2,"Background
Mechanical ventilation is a potentially painful and discomforting intervention that is widely used in neonatal intensive care. Newborn infants demonstrate increased sensitivity to pain, which may affect clinical and neurodevelopmental outcomes. The use of drugs that reduce pain might be important in improving survival and neurodevelopmental outcomes. 
Objectives
To determine the benefits and harms of opioid analgesics for neonates (term or preterm) receiving mechanical ventilation compared to placebo or no drug, other opioids, or other analgesics or sedatives. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 9), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 29 September 2020); Embase (1980 to 29 September 2020); and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to 29 September 2020). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing opioids to placebo or no drug, to other opioids, or to other analgesics or sedatives in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation. We excluded cross‐over trials. We included term (≥ 37 weeks' gestational age) and preterm (< 37 weeks' gestational age) newborn infants on mechanical ventilation. We included any duration of drug treatment and any dosage given continuously or as bolus; we excluded studies that gave opioids to ventilated infants for procedures. 
Data collection and analysis
For each of the included trials, we independently extracted data (e.g. number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, types of opioids) using Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group (EPOC) criteria and assessed the risk of bias (e.g. adequacy of randomisation, blinding, completeness of follow‐up). We evaluated treatment effects using a fixed‐effect model with risk ratio (RR) for categorical data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We included 23 studies (enrolling 2023 infants) published between 1992 and 2019. Fifteen studies (1632 infants) compared the use of morphine or fentanyl versus placebo or no intervention. Four studies included both term and preterm infants, and one study only term infants; all other studies included only preterm infants, with five studies including only very preterm infants. We are uncertain whether opioids have an effect on the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) Scale in the first 12 hours after infusion (MD ‐5.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐6.88 to ‐4.59; 50 participants, 2 studies) and between 12 and 48 hours after infusion (MD ‐0.98, 95% CI ‐1.35 to ‐0.61; 963 participants, 3 studies) because of limitations in study design, high heterogeneity (inconsistency), and imprecision of estimates (very low‐certainty evidence ‐ GRADE). The use of morphine or fentanyl probably has little or no effect in reducing duration of mechanical ventilation (MD 0.23 days, 95% CI ‐0.38 to 0.83; 1259 participants, 7 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence because of unclear risk of bias in most studies) and neonatal mortality (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.55; 1189 participants, 5 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence because of imprecision of estimates). We are uncertain whether opioids have an effect on neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 24 months (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.39 to 10.29; 78 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence because of serious imprecision of the estimates and indirectness). Limited data were available for the other comparisons (i.e. two studies (54 infants) on morphine versus midazolam, three (222 infants) on morphine versus fentanyl, and one each on morphine versus diamorphine (88 infants), morphine versus remifentanil (20 infants), fentanyl versus sufentanil (20 infants), and fentanyl versus remifentanil (24 infants)). For these comparisons, no meta‐analysis was conducted because outcomes were reported by one study. 
Authors' conclusions
We are uncertain whether opioids have an effect on pain and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 24 months; the use of morphine or fentanyl probably has little or no effect in reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation and neonatal mortality. Data on the other comparisons planned in this review (opioids versus analgesics; opioids versus other opioids) are extremely limited and do not allow any conclusions. In the absence of firm evidence to support a routine policy, opioids should be used selectively ‐ based on clinical judgement and evaluation of pain indicators ‐ although pain measurement in newborns has limitations.

Studying Pain Medicine for Babies Who Need Help Breathing

**Rationale**
**Why was this study done?**
Newborn babies sometimes have trouble breathing on their own. They may need to be on a breathing machine. A breathing machine helps a baby breathe, but it can be painful or uncomfortable.

Pain can be very hard on a newborn baby. It can affect how the baby grows and how their brain develops over time.

Doctors sometimes use strong pain medicines called opioids to help. Morphine and fentanyl are two types of opioids. Researchers wanted to know if these medicines truly help babies on breathing machines. This study looked at past research to see if these medicines are helpful or harmful for newborns.

**Trial Design**
**How was this study designed?**
This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, the researchers looked for all the past studies that had already been done on this topic. This type of study is called a review. It helps combine information from many studies to get a clearer answer.

The researchers found 23 different studies. These studies included over 2000 newborn babies in total. Some babies were born early, and some were born on time. All the babies in these studies were on a breathing machine.

The studies compared babies who got an opioid pain medicine with babies who got no pain medicine. Some studies also compared different types of pain medicine to each other. The researchers looked at all the results to see what they could learn.

**Results**
**What were the main results of the study?**
The researchers looked at several key questions to see if the pain medicines helped.

*   **Did the medicine reduce pain?** The researchers could not be sure if the medicines helped reduce the babies' pain. The information from the studies was not clear enough to give a strong answer.

*   **Did babies get off the breathing machine sooner?** The pain medicines probably did not shorten the time that babies needed to be on the breathing machine.

*   **Did the medicine help more babies survive?** The pain medicines probably did not change a baby’s chance of living or dying.

*   **How did the medicine affect brain development?** The researchers looked at information on how the babies’ brains developed when they were about 2 years old. They were not sure if the pain medicine had any effect, good or bad. There was not enough information to know for sure.

**What did the researchers conclude?**
Based on all the past studies, we are still not sure if opioid pain medicines help babies on breathing machines. The proof that these medicines reduce pain or help with brain development is not strong.

The medicines probably do not help babies get off the breathing machine sooner or improve their chances of survival. Because there is not firm proof that these medicines help, doctors should use them carefully. They should decide to use them for each baby based on that baby’s signs of pain. More research is needed to understand the best way to treat pain in these tiny patients.","Opioids for newborns receiving mechanical ventilation

Do drugs such as morphine and fentanyl (opioids) save lives, reduce pain, or improve the long‐term development of newborns needing breathing machines (mechanical ventilators)?Background 
Breathing machines are widely used for newborn full‐term (≥ 37 weeks' gestational age) and preterm (< 37 weeks' gestational age) babies with breathing problems. Breathing machines may cause babies pain. Moreover, their use requires the presence and suctioning of a tube placed in the baby's trachea (which connects the larynx to the bronchi of the lungs), thus causing additional pain and distress. Since newborn babies are very sensitive to pain, which may have a bad effect on future development, pain reduction with drugs (including opioids such as morphine and fentanyl) might be very important. Pain in babies is assessed by adults by using different scales, which focus on the baby's appearance and behaviour, and on other parameters. Study characteristicsWe collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer the review question and found 23 studies enrolling 2023 babies. In most studies, babies were born before the due date (before 37 weeks' gestational age). Eight studies compared the use of morphine versus placebo (a substance with no therapeutic value) or no intervention, and seven versus fentanyl. We analysed the other studies separately because researchers compared the use of these two drugs with other opioids or other analgesics. 
Key results 
We are uncertain whether opioids have an effect on pain and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 24 months; use of morphine or fentanyl probably has little or no effect in reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation and neonatal mortality. Further research is needed. 
Certainty of evidence 
The certainty of evidence is very low to moderate because overall only a small number of studies have looked at this intervention, few babies were included in these studies, and some studies could have been better designed.

10.1002-14651858.CD013518.pub2,"Background
Asthma affects 350 million people worldwide including 45% to 70% with mild disease. Treatment is mainly with inhalers containing beta₂‐agonists, typically taken as required to relieve bronchospasm, and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as regular preventive therapy. Poor adherence to regular therapy is common and increases the risk of exacerbations, morbidity and mortality. Fixed‐dose combination inhalers containing both a steroid and a fast‐acting beta₂‐agonist (FABA) in the same device simplify inhalers regimens and ensure symptomatic relief is accompanied by preventative therapy. Their use is established in moderate asthma, but they may also have potential utility in mild asthma. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of single combined (fast‐onset beta₂‐agonist plus an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)) inhaler only used as needed in people with mild asthma. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal. We contacted trial authors for further information and requested details regarding the possibility of unpublished trials. The most recent search was conducted on 19 March 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cross‐over trials with at least one week washout period. We included studies of a single fixed‐dose FABA/ICS inhaler used as required compared with no treatment, placebo, short‐acting beta agonist (SABA) as required, regular ICS with SABA as required, regular fixed‐dose combination ICS/long‐acting beta agonist (LABA), or regular fixed‐dose combination ICS/FABA with as required ICS/FABA. We planned to include cluster‐randomised trials if the data had been or could be adjusted for clustering. We excluded trials shorter than 12 weeks. We included full texts, abstracts and unpublished data. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (OR) or rate ratios (RR) and continuous data as mean difference (MD). We reported 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used Cochrane's standard methodological procedures of meta‐analysis. We applied the GRADE approach to summarise results and to assess the overall certainty of evidence. Primary outcomes were exacerbations requiring systemic steroids, hospital admissions/emergency department or urgent care visits for asthma, and measures of asthma control. 
Main results
We included six studies of which five contributed results to the meta‐analyses. All five used budesonide 200 μg and formoterol 6 μg in a dry powder formulation as the combination inhaler. Comparator fast‐acting bronchodilators included terbutaline and formoterol. Two studies included children aged 12+ and adults; two studies were open‐label. A total of 9657 participants were included, with a mean age of 36 to 43 years. 2.3% to 11% were current smokers. 
FABA / ICS as required versus FABA as required 
Compared with as‐required FABA alone, as‐required FABA/ICS reduced exacerbations requiring systemic steroids (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.60, 2 RCTs, 2997 participants, high‐certainty evidence), equivalent to 109 people out of 1000 in the FABA alone group experiencing an exacerbation requiring systemic steroids, compared to 52 (95% CI 40 to 68) out of 1000 in the FABA/ICS as‐required group. FABA/ICS as required may also reduce the odds of an asthma‐related hospital admission or emergency department or urgent care visit (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.60, 2 RCTs, 2997 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
Compared with as‐required FABA alone, any changes in asthma control or spirometry, though favouring as‐required FABA/ICS, were small and less than the minimal clinically‐important differences. We did not find evidence of differences in asthma‐associated quality of life or mortality. For other secondary outcomes FABA/ICS as required was associated with reductions in fractional exhaled nitric oxide, probably reduces the odds of an adverse event (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.95, 2 RCTs, 3002 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) and may reduce total systemic steroid dose (MD ‐9.90, 95% CI ‐19.38 to ‐0.42, 1 RCT, 443 participants, low‐certainty evidence), and with an increase in the daily inhaled steroid dose (MD 77 μg beclomethasone equiv./day, 95% CI 69 to 84, 2 RCTs, 2554 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). 
FABA/ICS as required versus regular ICS plus FABA as required 
There may be little or no difference in the number of people with asthma exacerbations requiring systemic steroid with FABA/ICS as required compared with regular ICS (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.07, 4 RCTs, 8065 participants, low‐certainty evidence), equivalent to 81 people out of 1000 in the regular ICS plus FABA group experiencing an exacerbation requiring systemic steroids, compared to 65 (95% CI 49 to 86) out of 1000 FABA/ICS as required group. The odds of an asthma‐related hospital admission or emergency department or urgent care visit may be reduced in those taking FABA/ICS as required (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.91, 4 RCTs, 8065 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
Compared with regular ICS, any changes in asthma control, spirometry, peak flow rates (PFR), or asthma‐associated quality of life, though favouring regular ICS, were small and less than the minimal clinically important differences (MCID). Adverse events, serious adverse events, total systemic corticosteroid dose and mortality were similar between groups, although deaths were rare, so confidence intervals for this analysis were wide. We found moderate‐certainty evidence from four trials involving 7180 participants that FABA/ICS as required was likely associated with less average daily exposure to inhaled corticosteroids than those on regular ICS (MD ‐154.51 μg/day, 95% CI ‐207.94 to ‐101.09). 
Authors' conclusions
We found FABA/ICS as required is clinically effective in adults and adolescents with mild asthma. Their use instead of FABA as required alone reduced exacerbations, hospital admissions or unscheduled healthcare visits and exposure to systemic corticosteroids and probably reduces adverse events. FABA/ICS as required is as effective as regular ICS and reduced asthma‐related hospital admissions or unscheduled healthcare visits, and average exposure to ICS, and is unlikely to be associated with an increase in adverse events. 
Further research is needed to explore use of FABA/ICS as required in children under 12 years of age, use of other FABA/ICS preparations, and long‐term outcomes beyond 52 weeks.

A New Way to Use Inhalers for Mild Asthma

**Rationale**
Asthma is a long-term lung disease that affects many people. It makes the airways in the lungs swell up. This can make it hard to breathe. Many people have a mild form of asthma.

Most people with asthma use two kinds of inhalers. One is a “reliever” inhaler. It has medicine that quickly opens the airways to make breathing easier. People use this when they feel asthma symptoms. The other is a “preventer” inhaler. It has a steroid medicine that keeps the swelling in the lungs down. People should use this type every day to prevent asthma attacks.

A big problem is that many people forget to use their preventer inhaler every day. When they skip it, they have a higher risk of a serious asthma attack. This can lead to hospital visits.

This study looked at a different way to treat mild asthma. It tested a single inhaler that has both the reliever and the preventer medicine mixed together. The main question was: Is it safe and helpful for people with mild asthma to use this single combo inhaler only when they need it? This new way might help people get the preventer medicine they need every time they get relief for their symptoms.

**Trial Design**
This report did not run a new study. Instead, researchers looked at the results of six past studies. They combined the information to get a stronger answer. The people in these studies were chosen by chance to be in different groups. This is the best way to test new treatments.

The studies included over 9,600 people with mild asthma. Most were adults, but some were as young as 12 years old. The average age was around 40.

The researchers compared three main ways of using inhalers:
*   **Group 1:** Used the single combo inhaler (with both reliever and preventer medicine) only when they had symptoms.
*   **Group 2:** Used a simple reliever inhaler only when they had symptoms. This is a common treatment for mild asthma.
*   **Group 3:** Used a preventer inhaler every single day, and a separate reliever inhaler when they had symptoms. This is also a common treatment.

Each study lasted for at least three months.

**Results**
Here is what the researchers found when they looked at all the studies together.

**Combo Inhaler vs. Reliever Inhaler Alone**

Using the combo inhaler only when needed was better than using just a reliever inhaler. People who used the combo inhaler had about half as many serious asthma attacks. A serious attack is one that needs strong steroid pills to treat. For every 1000 people using only a reliever, about 109 had a serious attack. For every 1000 people using the combo inhaler, only about 52 had a serious attack.

People using the combo inhaler were also less likely to need to go to the hospital or an emergency room for their asthma. They also had fewer side effects from their medicine.

**Combo Inhaler vs. Daily Preventer Inhaler**

The study then compared using the combo inhaler as needed with the standard plan of a daily preventer plus a reliever. Both plans were about the same at preventing serious asthma attacks.

However, people who used the combo inhaler only when needed were less likely to visit the hospital or an emergency room. A very important result was that this group used much less steroid medicine over time. This is because they did not have to take a dose every day. This can be safer in the long run.

**Conclusions from the Study**

For adults and teens with mild asthma, using a single combo inhaler only when symptoms appear is a good and safe treatment. It works very well to prevent serious asthma attacks. It also lowers the number of hospital visits. This plan helps people use a lot less steroid medicine than if they took a preventer inhaler every day.

More studies are needed to see if this is a good plan for children under the age of 12.","Combination fixed‐dose beta agonist and steroid inhaler as required for adults or children with mild asthma 
Background 
Asthma is the most common respiratory illness. Many people with asthma have mild asthma, but still remain at risk of severe asthma exacerbations, which often result in the use of oral steroids. Mild asthma is commonly treated with preventative inhalers, which contain a steroid used to reduce inflammation in the airways, and with reliever inhalers, which relax the muscles of the airways causing quick relief of asthma symptoms. Combination inhalers contain both the preventative steroid and the reliever, simplifying treatment and ensuring steroids are always given alongside the immediate relief of symptoms. 
Review question 
We examined the findings of clinical trials to assess the use of combination inhalers in the treatment of mild asthma when taken on an as‐needed, symptom‐driven basis. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to March 2021. Results were collected from six studies which compared use of a combination inhaler used on an as‐needed basis with either as‐needed reliever‐only therapy or daily treatment with a low dose preventative inhaler. 
Key findings 
We found that combination inhalers used as‐needed when compared with reliever‐only treatment reduced severe exacerbations requiring tablet steroids and rates of emergency admission to hospital with asthma symptoms. Differences in other measures relating to symptom control and lung function were too small to be clinically important. Rates of severe exacerbations were similar between patients on daily preventative steroid inhalers and those using combination inhalers as‐needed. People using combination inhalers had lower rates of hospital admission and lower total inhaled steroid dose, whilst the differences in lung function and asthma symptom control were not clinically significant. 
This review found the use of combination inhalers used when the patient experiences asthma symptoms was beneficial in reducing severe exacerbations when compared to stand‐alone reliever therapy in mild asthma. In addition to this the use of combination inhalers used on an as‐needed basis was associated with a reduction in hospital admissions and total inhaled steroid dose when compared with regularly‐taken low dose preventative inhaler therapy. 
Quality of the evidence 
The studies which contributed data were well‐designed and robust, although two were open‐label (participants knew which treatment they were getting), with some potential for bias, so the evidence was generally of moderate‐to‐high quality.

Does a Drug Called G-CSF Help the Heart Heal After a Heart Attack?

### **Rationale**

A heart attack happens when blood flow to the heart gets blocked. This can damage the heart muscle. The damaged part of the heart does not heal well. This can make the heart weaker for the rest of a person’s life.

Doctors are looking for new ways to help the heart heal. One idea is to use special cells called stem cells. Stem cells are the body’s own builder cells. They can help repair damage in the body.

This study looked at a drug called G-CSF. Doctors hoped this drug could send a signal to the body’s stem cells. The hope was that this signal would tell the stem cells to travel to the heart and fix the damaged muscle. This study was needed to see if G-CSF is a safe and helpful treatment for people after a heart attack.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers did a ""review."" This means they looked at the results from seven older studies that were already completed. By combining the results, researchers can get a stronger and more reliable answer.

The people in all seven studies were adults who had a heart attack. In each study, the people were split into two groups. One group got the G-CSF drug. The other group got a fake treatment, called a placebo. A placebo looks like the real drug but has no medicine in it. This helps doctors see if the drug works better than nothing.

The researchers who did this review noted some problems with the older studies. One problem was that the studies did not follow patients for a very long time. This makes it hard to know the long-term effects of the drug.

### **Results**

The main result of this review was that the G-CSF drug did not help the heart heal. The researchers looked at many different measures of heart health. They found no real difference between the people who got the G-CSF drug and those who got the fake treatment.

The drug did not improve how well the heart pumped blood. It also did not change the size of the damaged part of the heart. The number of people who died was about the same in both groups. This means the G-CSF drug did not save lives in these studies.

The good news was that the drug did not seem to cause any serious harm or bad side effects. But because the studies were not very long, we cannot be sure about the long-term safety.

Based on this review of seven studies, the researchers made a clear conclusion. They concluded that doctors should not give the G-CSF drug to patients after a heart attack. The results show that it does not provide any benefit to help the heart get stronger.","Granulocyte colony stimulating factor treatment following a heart attack

What was the aim of this review? 
Oral health means the condition of the mouth, throat, teeth and gums. The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if school dental screening improves oral health of children; and if it does, which screening method works best. We found eight relevant studies to answer this question. This is the second update of a review that was published in December 2017 and first updated in August 2019. 
Key message 
There is not enough evidence to draw conclusions about whether traditional school dental screening can improve dental attendance (can lead to children visiting the dentist more often). Moreover, it is not clear if improvement in dental attendance leads to better oral health. We still need high‐quality studies that measure the impact of screening on oral health over longer periods of time. 
What did this review study? 
Oral diseases, especially tooth decay (called 'dental caries' by dentists), affect children worldwide. If untreated, oral health can deteriorate and negatively impact children's general well‐being. It also has a financial cost for families and society as a whole. 
School dental screening involves a dental professional examining children's mouths and teeth at school and letting parents know about their child's oral condition and treatment needs. It aims to identify oral health concerns at an early stage and prompt parents to seek treatment where required. Whether this actually improves children's oral health is the question we wanted to answer in this review. 
What were the main results of this review? 
Our updated search identified one new study to be included since the last version of the review was published. In total, the review includes eight studies that presented results for 21,290 children. Four studies took place in the UK, two in India, one in the USA and one in Saudi Arabia. The children were 4 to 15 years old. Studies looked at the oral health and dental attendance of children who were screened in school compared to children who did not have screening. Some studies also compared different ways of screening and different forms of follow‐up (e.g. advice letter or referral). 
We do not know whether traditional school dental screening improves dental attendance. Studies looking at screening based on specific criteria (e.g. targeted at children not registered with a dentist) suggested it may be slightly more effective than no screening for improving attendance at the dentist. There may be no difference between criteria‐based screening and universal screening for improving dental attendance, but we are very unsure about the results. 
A personalised or specific referral letter to parents may improve dental attendance more than a non‐specific letter, but we are very unsure about the results. 
Screening with added motivation (health education and offer of free treatment) may improve dental attendance compared to screening alone, but we are very unsure about the results. 
One study comparing different referral letters (with more or less information about dental diseases) found that neither was better than the other for improving dental treatment in children. 
A specific referral letter did not encourage more parents to take their children to the dentist when compared to a letter with generic advice to visit the dentist. 
The eight studies followed up children for 3 to 11 months after they received screening. Therefore, we do not know the effects of screening over a longer period of time. 
None of the studies checked whether there were any negative effects of screening programmes or how much they cost.

Does Checking Children's Teeth at School Improve Their Oral Health?

**Rationale**

The health of your mouth, teeth, and gums is called oral health. Good oral health is very important for a child’s overall well-being. Poor oral health, like having tooth decay (cavities), is a common problem for children all over the world. If tooth decay is not treated, it can cause pain. This can make it hard for a child to eat, speak, and learn in school. Taking care of these problems can also cost families and healthcare systems a lot of money.

One idea to help find these problems early is a school dental check-up. This is when a dentist or dental nurse visits a school to look at children’s teeth. After the check-up, they send a note home to parents. The note tells parents about their child’s oral health. It also says if their child needs to see a dentist for treatment.

The goal of these check-ups is to find oral health problems early and encourage parents to get care for their children. But we were not sure if these school programs actually lead to more children visiting the dentist or having healthier teeth. This study was done to look at all the research available to see if school dental check-ups really work.

**Trial Design**

This was a review study. This means the researchers did not do a new experiment with new patients. Instead, they gathered and reviewed the results of other studies that were already completed. This helps to get a bigger and clearer picture of the topic.

The researchers found eight main studies to include in this review. These studies took place in several countries, including the United Kingdom, India, the United States, and Saudi Arabia. Together, the studies included the results for more than 21,000 children. The children in the studies were between 4 and 15 years old.

These studies compared children who got dental check-ups at school to children who did not. Some studies also looked at different ways of doing the check-ups. For example, they tested if sending a personal letter to parents worked better than a general letter. The studies followed the children for a period of 3 to 11 months after the check-ups took place.

**Results**

The main result of this review is that there is not enough strong proof to say if school dental check-ups are helpful. We still do not know if these check-ups make children visit the dentist more often. We also do not know if they lead to better oral health in the long run.

Some findings from the review were:
*   Checking only some children (like those who do not have a regular dentist) might be slightly better at getting them to a dentist than no check-up at all. But the researchers were not very sure about this.
*   Sending parents a personal letter about their child might work better than a general letter. Again, the researchers were not certain about this result.
*   Adding health education lessons or an offer for free treatment to the check-up may help get more children to the dentist. But the proof for this was also not strong.

The studies in the review only followed children for a short time, less than one year. Because of this, we do not know the effects of these check-ups over a longer period. None of the studies looked at possible bad effects, like causing children or parents to worry. The studies also did not report on how much these programs cost to run.

The researchers concluded that we need more and better studies in the future. These new studies should follow children for a longer time. They also need to measure if the check-ups actually improve children’s oral health, not just if they lead to a dental visit.","School dental screening programmes for improving oral health of children

10.1002-14651858.CD013224.pub2,"Background
Chordoma is a rare primary bone tumour with a high propensity for local recurrence. Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment, but complete resection is often morbid due to tumour location. Similarly, the dose of radiotherapy (RT) that surrounding healthy organs can tolerate is frequently below that required to provide effective tumour control. Therefore, clinicians have investigated different radiation delivery techniques, often in combination with surgery, aimed to improve the therapeutic ratio. 
Objectives
To assess the effects and toxicity of proton and photon adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) in people with biopsy‐confirmed chordoma. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (2021, Issue 4); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to April 2021); Embase Ovid (1980 to April 2021) and online registers of clinical trials, and abstracts of scientific meetings up until April 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included adults with pathologically confirmed primary chordoma, who were irradiated with curative intent, with protons or photons in the form of fractionated RT, SRS (stereotactic radiosurgery), SBRT (stereotactic body radiotherapy), or IMRT (intensity modulated radiation therapy). We limited analysis to studies that included outcomes of participants treated with both protons and photons. 
Data collection and analysis
The primary outcomes were local control, mortality, recurrence, and treatment‐related toxicity. We followed current standard Cochrane methodological procedures for data extraction, management, and analysis. We used the ROBINS‐I tool to assess risk of bias, and GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included six observational studies with 187 adult participants. We judged all studies to be at high risk of bias. Four studies were included in meta‐analysis. 
We are uncertain if proton compared to photon therapy worsens or has no effect on local control (hazard ratio (HR) 5.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 43.43; 2 observational studies, 39 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Median survival time ranged between 45.5 months and 66 months. We are uncertain if proton compared to photon therapy reduces or has no effect on mortality (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.57; 4 observational studies, 65 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Median recurrence‐free survival ranged between 3 and 10 years. We are uncertain whether proton compared to photon therapy reduces or has no effect on recurrence (HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.17; 4 observational studies, 94 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
One study assessed treatment‐related toxicity and reported that four participants on proton therapy developed radiation‐induced necrosis in the temporal bone, radiation‐induced damage to the brainstem, and chronic mastoiditis; one participant on photon therapy developed hearing loss, worsening of the seventh cranial nerve paresis, and ulcerative keratitis (risk ratio (RR) 1.28, 95% CI 0.17 to 9.86; 1 observational study, 33 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). There is no evidence that protons led to reduced toxicity. 
There is very low‐certainty evidence to show an advantage for proton therapy in comparison to photon therapy with respect to local control, mortality, recurrence, and treatment related toxicity. 
Authors' conclusions
There is a lack of published evidence to confirm a clinical difference in effect with either proton or photon therapy for the treatment of chordoma. As radiation techniques evolve, multi‐institutional data should be collected prospectively and published, to help identify persons that would most benefit from the available radiation treatment techniques.

Comparing Two Types of Radiation Therapy for a Rare Bone Tumor Called Chordoma

**Rationale**
Chordoma is a rare type of cancer. It grows in the bones of the skull and spine. This type of tumor can come back after it has been treated.

Surgery is the most common way to treat chordoma. But surgery can be hard. The tumors often grow near important parts of the body, like the brain and spinal cord. Removing them can cause serious problems.

Another treatment is radiation therapy. Radiation uses high-energy beams to kill cancer cells. But radiation can also harm the healthy parts of the body near the tumor.

Doctors have found new ways to give radiation. This study looked at two types of radiation therapy. One is called proton therapy. The other is called photon therapy. Researchers wanted to see if one type works better or is safer than the other for treating chordoma.

**Trial Design**
This study did not treat new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of past studies. They searched for studies that were done up to April 2021.

The researchers found 6 studies to review. These studies included a total of 187 adults who had chordoma tumors. All of these people were treated with either proton therapy or photon therapy.

The goal was to combine the information from all 6 studies. By doing this, the researchers hoped to compare the two treatments. They wanted to see how each treatment affected the patients.

**Results**
The researchers looked at four main things:
*   Stopping the tumor from growing in the same spot.
*   How long people lived after treatment.
*   Stopping the tumor from coming back.
*   Harmful side effects from the treatment.

After looking at all the studies, the researchers were not sure if one treatment was better than the other. The information from the studies was not strong enough to show a clear difference. This is called “very low-certainty evidence.”

For all four things they looked at, the results were uncertain. The study could not tell if proton therapy or photon therapy was better at controlling the tumor. It could not tell if one helped people live longer or stopped the tumor from coming back.

One of the studies reported on side effects. In the group that got proton therapy, 4 people had side effects. These included damage to a bone in the head, brain damage, and long-term ear infections. In the group that got photon therapy, 1 person had side effects. These included hearing loss and nerve damage. The researchers could not say if one treatment was safer than the other based on this small number of people.

The authors of the study concluded that there is not enough proof to say which type of radiation is better for chordoma. They believe that new and better studies are needed. These new studies should carefully collect information. This will help doctors and patients choose the best treatment in the future.","Proton radiation therapy versus conventional radiation treatment (i.e. photon radiation) for the treatment of chordoma 
What is the issue?Chordoma is a rare tumour that can grow at any location in the spine. Because some of the locations are difficult to reach, some of the tumour may be left behind, even after aggressive surgery. When this happens, radiation to the postoperative area can help reduce the chance of the tumour coming back. Given the closeness to the spinal cord and other important organs, special radiation techniques are required to maximise tumour control, while minimising harm to normal tissues in the body. 
Why is this review important?At the time of this review, there is a lack of evidence to confirm a benefit with proton therapy compared to conventional photon radiation treatment. However, it is important to note that this review found a number of delivery techniques for both proton and photon therapy. As evidence comparing the latest techniques for proton and photon therapy emerges, we will update this review. 
The aim of the review:The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether proton therapy is more effective than photon therapy for improving local control, and reducing mortality, recurrence, and treatment‐related toxicity. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. 
What are the main findings?We included six studies that enrolled 187 adults with chordoma, four of which we included in a meta‐analysis. We are uncertain whether proton radiation therapy compared to conventional photon radiation treatment improves local control, because our confidence in the evidence was very low (2 observational studies, 39 participants). We are uncertain whether proton therapy compared to photon therapy reduces mortality (4 observational studies, 65 participants), recurrence (4 observational studies, 94 participants), or treatment‐related toxicity (1 observational study, 33 participants). 
Quality of the Evidence:We found very low‐certainty evidence for all outcomes due to high risk of bias in all the included observational studies, very small sample sizes, and varying ranges in the duration of participants' follow‐up period between studies. 
Authors' conclusions:From the currently available evidence, we do not know if proton therapy, used for adults with chordoma, is associated with clinically appreciable benefits and acceptable harms. 
The existing research on this question is solely of non‐randomised design, and is underpowered, with substantial imprecision. Any estimates of effect based on the existing insufficient evidence is very uncertain and is likely to change with future research.

10.1002-14651858.CD013845.pub2,"Background
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD; also known as autism) is a developmental disability that begins in childhood and is typically seen in around 1% to 2% of children. It is characterised by social communication difficulties and repetitive and restricted behaviours and routines that can have a negative impact on a child's quality of life, achievement at school, and social interactions with others. It has been hypothesised that memantine, which is traditionally used to treat dementia, may be effective in reducing the core symptoms of autism as well as some co‐occurring symptoms such as hyperactivity and language difficulties. If memantine is being used to treat the core symptoms of autism, it is important to review the evidence of its effectiveness. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of memantine on the core symptoms of autism, including, but not limited to, social communication and stereotypical behaviours. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, nine other databases and three trials registers up to February 2022. We also checked reference lists of key studies and checked with experts in the field for any additional papers. We searched for retractions of the included studies in MEDLINE, Embase, and the Retraction Watch Database. No retractions or corrections were found. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any dose of memantine compared with placebo in autistic people. We also included RCTs in which only one group received memantine, but both groups received the same additional therapy (e.g. a behaviour intervention). 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were core autism symptoms and adverse effects. Secondary outcomes were language, intelligence, memory, adaptive behaviour, hyperactivity, and irritability. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We included three RCTs (two double‐blind and one single‐blind) with 204 participants that examined the short‐term effect (immediately postintervention) of memantine in autistic people. Two studies took place in the USA and the other in Iran. All three studies focused on children and adolescents, with a mean age of 9.40 (standard deviation (SD) 2.26) years. Most participants were male (range across studies 73% to 87%). The diagnosis of ASD was based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edition; 4th edition, text revision; or 5th edition). To confirm the diagnosis, one study used the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview‐Revised (ADI‐R); one used ADOS, ADI‐R or the Autism Diagnostic Interview Screener; and one used the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale. Dosage of memantine was based on the child's weight and ranged from 3 mg to 15 mg per day.  
Comparisons Two studies examined memantine compared with placebo; in the other study, both groups had a behavioural intervention while only one group was given memantine.  
Risk of biasAll studies were rated at high risk of bias overall, as they were at high or unclear risk of bias across all but four domains in one study, and all but two domains in the other two studies. One study was funded by Forest Laboratories, LLC, (Jersey City, New Jersey), Allergan. The study sponsor was involved in the study design, data collection (via contracted clinical investigator sites), analysis and interpretation of data, and the decision to present these results. The other two studies reported no financial support or sponsorship; though in one of the two, the study medication was an in‐kind contribution from Forest Pharmaceuticals. 
Primary outcomesThere was no clear evidence of a difference between memantine and placebo with respect to severity of core symptoms of autism, although we are very uncertain about the evidence. The standardised mean difference in autism symptoms score in the intervention group versus the control group was –0.74 standard deviations (95% confidence interval (CI) −2.07 to 0.58; 2 studies, 181 participants; very low‐certainty evidence; medium effect size); lower scores indicate less severe autistic symptoms. Two studies (144 participants) recorded adverse effects that the authors deemed related to the study and found there may be no difference between memantine and placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.39; low‐certainty evidence). 
Secondary outcomesThere may be no difference between memantine and placebo on language (2 studies, 144 participants; low‐certainty evidence); memory or adaptive behaviour (1 study, 23 participants; both low‐certainty evidence); or hyperactivity or irritability (1 study, 121 participants; both low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
It is unclear whether memantine is an effective treatment for autistic children. None of the three included trials reported on the effectiveness of memantine in adults. Further studies using rigorous designs, larger samples, longer follow‐up and clinically meaningful outcome measures that are important to autistic people and their families will strengthen our knowledge of the effects of memantine in autism.

Does a Drug for Dementia Help Children with Autism?

### **Rationale**

Autism is a condition that starts in childhood. It affects about 1 to 2 in every 100 children. Autism can make it hard for a person to talk and connect with others. People with autism may also have set routines or repeat certain behaviors. This can make it hard to make friends, do well in school, and enjoy life.

Doctors are always looking for ways to help people with autism. One drug, called memantine, is normally used to help with memory loss in older adults. Some doctors thought this drug might also help children with autism. They thought it could help with the main signs of autism, as well as with things like being too active or having trouble with language.

Researchers wanted to look at all the past studies on this drug. They needed to see if there was any good proof that memantine really helps treat children with autism.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers looked for studies that were already done. They found three studies that fit what they were looking for.

These three studies included a total of 204 children and teenagers with autism. The average age of the children was about 9 years old. Most of the children in the studies were boys.

In the studies, the children were put into groups by chance. One group took the real drug, memantine. The other group took a placebo. A placebo is a pill that looks like the real drug but has no medicine in it, like a sugar pill. This helps researchers see if the real drug is the reason for any changes. The studies only looked at the effects of the drug for a short amount of time.

### **Results**

After reviewing the three studies, the researchers could not find clear proof that memantine helped with the main signs of autism. The proof they found was very weak. This means we still do not know if the drug really works for autism.

The researchers also looked at side effects. They found that children who took memantine did not seem to have more side effects than those who took the sugar pill. But the proof for this was also not very strong. The drug also did not seem to help with language, memory, or being too active.

The researchers found that there were problems with how all three of the studies were done. These problems make it hard to be sure about the results. For example, a drug company that makes memantine helped pay for and run one of the studies.

In the end, the researchers concluded that it is still unclear if memantine is a good treatment for children with autism. No studies have looked at using this drug for adults with autism. We need more and better studies to get a clear answer. Future studies should have more people, last longer, and measure things that are truly important to people with autism and their families.","Can a dementia medicine (memantine) help people with autism spectrum disorder?
BackgroundAutism spectrum disorder (autism) is a condition that begins in childhood. Core symptoms include persistent difficulties with social communication (e.g. difficulties with back‐and‐forth conversations, communication without words, and in developing and maintaining relationships), and repetitive and restricted interests and behaviours (e.g. repetitive mannerisms, restricted interests and behaviours, resistance to change and sensory sensitivities). Around 1% to 2% of children have autism. Autistic people often have other conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, language impairments (e.g. difficulties understanding and using grammar) and intellectual disability. Autism can have negative impacts on quality of life, school achievement and social relationships. Memantine is a medication traditionally used to treat dementia, but some studies suggest that it may decrease core autistic symptoms. If memantine is being used to change the core symptoms of autism, it is important to assess whether it works and is safe. This review combines the research evidence on the use of memantine in autism. 
Review questionDoes memantine change the core symptoms of autism and related behaviours? 
Search dateThe evidence is current to 14 February 2022. 
Study characteristicsWe found three studies with 204 people that had evaluated the effectiveness of memantine in autism. All studies were randomised controlled trials, meaning participants were randomly allocated to receive either the treatment or a dummy pill (placebo). This is the best design for assessing the effectiveness of treatments. All three studies included children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, with an average age of 9.40 years. We found no studies in adults. The children received memantine (for 12 weeks in two studies and for 24 weeks in one study), and their behaviour was assessed before treatment and immediately after treatment. 
Study funding sourcesOne study was sponsored and funded by a laboratory that makes memantine (Forest). The study sponsor helped to design the study, collect information, analyse and interpret the information, and take the decision to publish the results. The authors of the other two smaller studies said they did not receive any funding; though in one of these studies, Forest Pharmaceuticals provided the medicine for free. 
Key resultsIt is unclear if memantine makes any difference to the core symptoms of autism. Additionally, there may be no difference between memantine and placebo in the occurrence of side effects, language ability, memory, adaptive behaviour or the autism‐related behaviours of hyperactivity and irritability. 
Limitations of the evidenceWe are not confident about the evidence for core symptoms of autism because it comes from only three small studies; because the studies included different types of people and delivered the medicine in different ways; and because the studies did not always provide information about everything we were interested in. Additionally, we have little confidence in the evidence on side effects and language because it comes from only two small studies; and we have little confidence in the evidence on intelligence, memory, adaptive behaviour, hyperactivity and irritability, because it comes from only one small study.

10.1002-14651858.CD015061,"Background
Individuals dying of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) may experience distressing symptoms such as breathlessness or delirium. Palliative symptom management can alleviate symptoms and improve the quality of life of patients. Various treatment options such as opioids or breathing techniques have been discussed for use in COVID‐19 patients. However, guidance on symptom management of COVID‐19 patients in palliative care has often been derived from clinical experiences and guidelines for the treatment of patients with other illnesses. An understanding of the effectiveness of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological palliative interventions to manage specific symptoms of COVID‐19 patients is required. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control in individuals with COVID‐19. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register (including Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), medRxiv); Web of Science Core Collection (Science Citation Index Expanded, Emerging Sources); CINAHL; WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease; and COAP Living Evidence on COVID‐19 to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions until 23 March 2021. 
We screened the reference lists of relevant review articles and current treatment guidelines for further literature. 
Selection criteria
We followed standard Cochrane methodology as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. 
We included studies evaluating palliative symptom management for individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID‐19 receiving interventions for palliative symptom control, with no restrictions regarding comorbidities, age, gender, or ethnicity. Interventions comprised pharmacological as well as non‐pharmacological treatment (e.g. acupressure, physical therapy, relaxation, or breathing techniques). We searched for the following types of studies: randomized controlled trials (RCT), quasi‐RCTs, controlled clinical trials, controlled before‐after studies, interrupted time series (with comparison group), prospective cohort studies, retrospective cohort studies, (nested) case‐control studies, and cross‐sectional studies. 
We searched for studies comparing pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control with standard care. 
We excluded studies evaluating palliative interventions for symptoms caused by other terminal illnesses. If studies enrolled populations with or exposed to multiple diseases, we would only include these if the authors provided subgroup data for individuals with COVID‐19. We excluded studies investigating interventions for symptom control in a curative setting, for example patients receiving life‐prolonging therapies such as invasive ventilation.  
Data collection and analysis
We used a modified version of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale for non‐randomized studies of interventions (NRSIs) to assess bias in the included studies. We included the following outcomes: symptom relief (primary outcome); quality of life; symptom burden; satisfaction of patients, caregivers, and relatives; serious adverse events; and grade 3 to 4 adverse events. 
We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
As meta‐analysis was not possible, we used tabulation to synthesize the studies and histograms to display the outcomes.  
Main results
Overall, we identified four uncontrolled retrospective cohort studies investigating pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control in hospitalized patients and patients in nursing homes. None of the studies included a comparator. We rated the risk of bias high across all studies. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for the primary outcome symptom relief, downgrading mainly for high risk of bias due to confounding and unblinded outcome assessors. 
Pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control 
We identified four uncontrolled retrospective cohort studies (five references) investigating pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control. Two references used the same register to form their cohorts, and study investigators confirmed a partial overlap of participants. We therefore do not know the exact number of participants, but individual reports included 61 to 2105 participants. Participants received multimodal pharmacological interventions: opioids, neuroleptics, anticholinergics, and benzodiazepines for relieving dyspnea (breathlessness), delirium, anxiety, pain, audible upper airway secretions, respiratory secretions, nausea, cough, and unspecified symptoms.  
Primary outcome: symptom relief 
All identified studies reported this outcome. For all symptoms (dyspnea, delirium, anxiety, pain, audible upper airway secretions, respiratory secretions, nausea, cough, and unspecified symptoms), a majority of interventions were rated as completely or partially effective by outcome assessors (treating clinicians or nursing staff). Interventions used in the studies were opioids, neuroleptics, anticholinergics, and benzodiazepines.  
We are very uncertain about the effect of pharmacological interventions on symptom relief (very low‐certainty evidence). The initial rating of the certainty of evidence was low since we only identified uncontrolled NRSIs. Our main reason for downgrading the certainty of evidence was high risk of bias due to confounding and unblinded outcome assessors. We therefore did not find evidence to confidently support or refute whether pharmacological interventions may be effective for palliative symptom relief in COVID‐19 patients. 
Secondary outcomes 
We planned to include the following outcomes: quality of life; symptom burden; satisfaction of patients, caregivers, and relatives; serious adverse events; and grade 3 to 4 adverse events. 
We did not find any data for these outcomes, or any other information on the efficacy and safety of used interventions. 
Non‐pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control 
None of the identified studies used non‐pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control. 
Authors' conclusions
We found very low certainty evidence for the efficacy of pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom relief in COVID‐19 patients. We found no evidence on the safety of pharmacological interventions or efficacy and safety of non‐pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control in COVID‐19 patients. The evidence presented here has no specific implications for palliative symptom control in COVID‐19 patients because we cannot draw any conclusions about the effectiveness or safety based on the identified evidence. More evidence is needed to guide clinicians, nursing staff, and caregivers when treating symptoms of COVID‐19 patients at the end of life. Specifically, future studies ought to investigate palliative symptom control in prospectively registered studies, using an active‐controlled setting, assess patient‐reported outcomes, and clearly define interventions. 
The publication of the results of ongoing studies will necessitate an update of this review. The conclusions of an updated review could differ from those of the present review and may allow for a better judgement regarding pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control in COVID‐19 patients.

Do Comfort Care Treatments Help People Dying from COVID-19?

### **Rationale**

**What is this study about?**
People with very serious COVID-19 can have hard symptoms at the end of their life. They may have a lot of trouble breathing. They can also feel very confused or scared. This is very difficult for patients and their families.

Care that helps people with these symptoms is called comfort care. It is also called palliative care. The goal of this care is not to cure the illness. The goal is to make the person feel as comfortable as possible. This helps them have a better quality of life.

**Why did we do this study?**
Doctors use many types of comfort care for other illnesses. This can be medicines for pain or to help with breathing. It can also be care without medicine, like breathing tips or ways to relax.

For COVID-19, doctors often used the same comfort care as they did for other sicknesses. But we did not know if these treatments worked well for people with COVID-19. We needed to look at all the research to see what works best and what is safe. This study aimed to find the best proof for comfort care treatments in people with COVID-19.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**
This was not a study with new patients. Instead, our team of researchers looked for all the past studies that had already been done. This type of study is called a review. We searched many places to find all the research on comfort care for COVID-19.

We looked for studies about adults with a sure case of COVID-19. These people were getting comfort care at the end of their life. The studies could include men and women of any age.

We looked for studies on two kinds of treatment.
1.  Treatments with medicine, such as pain killers.
2.  Treatments without medicine, such as physical therapy or relaxation tips.

We wanted to see if these treatments helped people more than the usual care. We looked at studies that were published up to March 2021.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**
Our team found four studies that fit what we were looking for. All four of these studies looked at treatments with medicine. We did not find any studies that looked at treatments without medicine for COVID-19 comfort care.

The four studies looked at people in hospitals or nursing homes. They used different medicines to help with many symptoms. These symptoms were trouble breathing, confusion, anxiety, pain, and cough. The medicines used were pain relievers and drugs to help people feel calm.

**Did the treatments help patients?**
In the four studies, doctors and nurses reported that the medicines seemed to help ease the patients' symptoms. Most of the time, they said the treatments worked well or worked a little bit.

However, the proof from these studies was very weak. The way the studies were done made it hard to be sure about the results. For example, there was no group of patients who got a fake treatment to compare with. Because of this, we are very unsure if the medicines were the real reason the patients felt better.

The studies also did not report any information about side effects. This means we do not know if the medicines were safe.

**What did the researchers conclude?**
Based on the weak proof, we cannot say for sure if these medicines help or harm people with COVID-19 at the end of life. There is not enough good research to be sure.

We need new studies that are done in a better way. These new studies will help us learn what comfort care works best for people with COVID-19. This will help doctors, nurses, and families make better choices for their loved ones.","Which treatments are best for symptoms in COVID‐19 patients at the end of life?
The burden of symptoms at the end of life of COVID‐19 patients and helpful treatments 
COVID‐19 patients may show symptoms such as breathlessness or delirium at the end of life. The goal of palliative medicine is to relieve such symptoms with specific treatments. Treatments can be drugs, for example opioids, or non‐drugs, such as breathing techniques or relaxation.  
What was the aim of our review? 
To explore how well different interventions (drugs and non‐drugs) work for the treatment of palliative symptoms in COVID‐19 patients at the end of life. We included patients of all ages and with all comorbidities (additional medical conditions).  
What type of studies did we search for? 
We searched selected medical databases and trial registries until 23 March 2021. We included studies looking at how well different palliative treatments work to relieve COVID‐19‐associated symptoms at the end of life. We wanted to compare studies investigating different medicines or therapies, but we only found studies without a comparison group. Only one study reported the specific drugs used for individual symptoms. 
Key results 
We found four studies that were published in five papers. Individual papers included between 61 and 2105 participants, and two papers partially reported on the same participants. All of the included studies investigated different drug treatments for palliative symptom management in people with COVID‐19. 
Drugs for symptom control at the end of life 
All of the included studies reported on the effectiveness of palliative care for symptom relief. In all studies, clinicians or nursing staff rated symptom relief rather than the patients themselves. Since the quality of the evidence was very low, we do not know the true effect of drug treatments on symptom relief and have very low confidence in the results of the studies. We did not find any data on quality of life; symptom burden; satisfaction of patients, caregivers, and relatives; or safety of the drug treatments. 
Non‐drug therapies for symptom control at the end of life 
We did not find any data on the benefits and harms of non‐drug therapies for symptom control of COVID‐19 patients at the end of life. 
Conclusions 
Based on our findings, we could not draw any conclusions on palliative symptom control of people with COVID‐19. Future studies need to be designed better so that we can determine which treatments work for symptom control in people with COVID‐19.

10.1002-14651858.CD012216.pub2,"18F‐florbetapir PET scan for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia and other dementias in people with mild cognitive impairment 
Review question: In people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), does using a 18F PET scan with florbetapir predict the progression to Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) and other dementias? 
Background 
Due to global ageing, the number of people with dementia is expected to increase dramatically in the next few decades. Diagnosing dementia at an early stage is desirable, but there is no widespread agreement on the best approach. A range of simple pen and paper tests used by healthcare professionals can assess people with poor memory or cognitive impairment. Whether or not using special PET scans that detect amyloid —one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease— improves our ability to predict the progression from MCI to ADD or other forms of dementia remains unclear. Since these tests are expensive, it is important that they provide additional benefits. 
Aim 
We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the 18F‐florbetapir PET scan in identifying those people with MCI who clinically progress to ADD, other types of dementia, or any form of dementia over a period of time. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to May 2017. We found three studies including 453 participants with MCI. Two studies evaluated the progression from MCI to ADD and one study evaluated the progression from MCI to any form of dementia. 
Regarding the two studies that evaluated the progression from MCI to ADD, one study had 401 participants with a follow‐up of 1.6 years and the mean age was 72 years. The other study had 47 participants with a follow‐up of three years, and the mean age was 72 years. 
The other study that looked at any form of dementia included 5 participants over 90 years old. 
Two of the studies were funded by the test manufacturer.
Quality of the evidence 
The main limitation of this review was that our findings were based on only three studies, with insufficient detail on how the people were selected, whether the information from the scan was assessed separately from the final diagnosis. The studies were considered to be at high risk of bias due to potential conflicts of interest detected. 
Key findings 
In this review, we found the following results based on the three studies.
At a follow‐up of 1.6 years, using visual assessment, the scan correctly classified 89% of the participants who progressed to ADD but only 58% of the participants who did not progress to ADD. This means that in a group of 100 people with MCI, 15% of whom will develop ADD, we would expect 13 of 15 people to have a positive result and the other 2 participants to be falsely negative. Also 49 people who will not develop ADD would have a negative result, but 36 people who will not develop ADD would have a positive result (false positives). 
In the study that followed up people for three years and used visual assessment, the scan correctly classified 67% of people who progressed to ADD and 71% who did not progress to ADD. This means that in a group of 100 people with MCI, 19 of whom will develop ADD, we would expect 13 people to have a positive result of the scan and 6 people to have a falsely negative result. In addition, 58 of 81 participants who will not progress to ADD would have a negative result, but 23 people who will not develop ADD would have a positive result (false positives). The small number of participants evaluated at three years lowered our confidence on these estimates of accuracy. 
Regarding progression to any form of dementia, the extremely small number of participants meant that we were unable to provide meaningful estimates of accuracy. 
We conclude that 18F‐florbetapir PET scans cannot be recommended for routine use in clinical practice to predict the progression from MCI to ADD or any form of dementia based on the currently available data. More studies are needed to demonstrate its usefulness.

Can a Special Brain Scan Find Alzheimer’s Disease Early?

### **Rationale**

Dementia is a health problem that affects the brain. It can make it hard for a person to think, remember, and do daily tasks. The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer’s disease.

As people get older, some may have more memory problems than others their age. This is called mild cognitive impairment, or MCI. Not everyone with MCI will get Alzheimer’s disease. But doctors want to find a good way to know who will. This can help patients and their families plan for the future.

This review looked at a special type of brain scan. The scan uses a substance to look for a protein in the brain called amyloid. A lot of this amyloid protein is a key sign of Alzheimer’s disease. Researchers wanted to know if this scan can accurately tell which people with MCI will later get Alzheimer’s disease. These scans are expensive, so it is important to know if they are truly helpful.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of past studies. This is called a review.

The researchers found three studies that fit their goal. In total, the studies included 453 people who had MCI. The people in the studies were around 72 years old.

Two of the studies checked to see who got Alzheimer's disease. One study watched about 400 people for a little more than a year and a half. The other study watched about 50 people for 3 years. A third study was very small, with only 5 people. It looked at who got any type of dementia.

The company that makes the brain scan paid for two of the studies. This could have affected the results.

### **Results**

The review found that the special brain scan was not very accurate. It made too many mistakes for it to be a useful tool for doctors.

The main problem was that the scan gave many ""false positive"" results. A false positive is when the scan says a person might get Alzheimer's, but they do not. This can cause a lot of worry and stress for no reason.

For example, think of a group of 100 people with MCI. Let's say 15 of them will get Alzheimer's.
*   The scan correctly found the disease in 13 of those 15 people.
*   But, it missed the disease in the other 2 people.
*   The bigger issue was with the 85 people who would *not* get Alzheimer’s. The scan gave a wrong, positive result for 36 of them. It said they might get Alzheimer’s when they would not.

A second, smaller study had similar findings. It also missed the disease in some people and gave many false positive results. Because this study was so small, the researchers did not have much confidence in its results.

The authors of the review concluded that this brain scan should not be used in regular clinics to predict Alzheimer’s. Based on the current information, the scan is not reliable enough. More and better studies are needed to see if this scan can be helpful in the future.","18F‐florbetapir PET scan for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia and other dementias in people with mild cognitive impairment 
Review question: In people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), does using a 18F PET scan with florbetapir predict the progression to Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) and other dementias? 
Background 
Due to global ageing, the number of people with dementia is expected to increase dramatically in the next few decades. Diagnosing dementia at an early stage is desirable, but there is no widespread agreement on the best approach. A range of simple pen and paper tests used by healthcare professionals can assess people with poor memory or cognitive impairment. Whether or not using special PET scans that detect amyloid —one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease— improves our ability to predict the progression from MCI to ADD or other forms of dementia remains unclear. Since these tests are expensive, it is important that they provide additional benefits. 
Aim 
We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the 18F‐florbetapir PET scan in identifying those people with MCI who clinically progress to ADD, other types of dementia, or any form of dementia over a period of time. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to May 2017. We found three studies including 453 participants with MCI. Two studies evaluated the progression from MCI to ADD and one study evaluated the progression from MCI to any form of dementia. 
Regarding the two studies that evaluated the progression from MCI to ADD, one study had 401 participants with a follow‐up of 1.6 years and the mean age was 72 years. The other study had 47 participants with a follow‐up of three years, and the mean age was 72 years. 
The other study that looked at any form of dementia included 5 participants over 90 years old. 
Two of the studies were funded by the test manufacturer.
Quality of the evidence 
The main limitation of this review was that our findings were based on only three studies, with insufficient detail on how the people were selected, whether the information from the scan was assessed separately from the final diagnosis. The studies were considered to be at high risk of bias due to potential conflicts of interest detected. 
Key findings 
In this review, we found the following results based on the three studies.
At a follow‐up of 1.6 years, using visual assessment, the scan correctly classified 89% of the participants who progressed to ADD but only 58% of the participants who did not progress to ADD. This means that in a group of 100 people with MCI, 15% of whom will develop ADD, we would expect 13 of 15 people to have a positive result and the other 2 participants to be falsely negative. Also 49 people who will not develop ADD would have a negative result, but 36 people who will not develop ADD would have a positive result (false positives). 
In the study that followed up people for three years and used visual assessment, the scan correctly classified 67% of people who progressed to ADD and 71% who did not progress to ADD. This means that in a group of 100 people with MCI, 19 of whom will develop ADD, we would expect 13 people to have a positive result of the scan and 6 people to have a falsely negative result. In addition, 58 of 81 participants who will not progress to ADD would have a negative result, but 23 people who will not develop ADD would have a positive result (false positives). The small number of participants evaluated at three years lowered our confidence on these estimates of accuracy. 
Regarding progression to any form of dementia, the extremely small number of participants meant that we were unable to provide meaningful estimates of accuracy. 
We conclude that 18F‐florbetapir PET scans cannot be recommended for routine use in clinical practice to predict the progression from MCI to ADD or any form of dementia based on the currently available data. More studies are needed to demonstrate its usefulness.

10.1002-14651858.CD006919.pub4,"Gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) used as an adjuvant to gonadotrophins in assisted reproduction treatments 
Review question 
Researchers from the Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence about the most effective way of using gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) as part of controlled ovarian stimulation in women undergoing assisted reproduction technology (ART). 
Background 
GnRHa are given along with hormone injections that stimulate the ovaries, in an attempt to prevent spontaneous release of eggs prior to their planned surgical retrieval. GnRHa have been proven to improve pregnancy rates; however, various regimens are described in the literature. We conducted this review to identify the most effective regimens. 
Study characteristics 
We found 37 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 3872 women comparing the use of GnRHa in various protocols. Twenty of these RCTs (1643 women) compared a long protocol with a short protocol. The evidence is current to April 2015. 
Key results 
In comparisons of long GnRHa protocols (where GnRHa is given for at least 14 days prior to the start of ovarian stimulation) versus short GnRHa protocols (when the GnRHa is given at the start of stimulation) there was no conclusive evidence of a difference in live birth and ongoing pregnancy rates. However there was moderate quality evidence of higher clinical pregnancy rates in the long protocol groups. Our findings suggest that in a population in which 14% of women achieve live birth or ongoing pregnancy using a short protocol, between 13% and 23% will achieve live birth or ongoing pregnancy using a long protocol. 
None of the other analyses showed any evidence of a difference in birth or pregnancy outcomes between the protocols compared. There was insufficient evidence to make any conclusions regarding adverse effects. Further research is needed to determine which long protocol is most cost effective and acceptable to women. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low. The main limitations in the evidence were failure to report live birth or ongoing pregnancy, poor reporting of methods in the primary studies, and imprecise findings due to lack of data. Only 10 of the 37 included studies were conducted within the last 10 years.

Comparing Different Ways to Use a Fertility Medicine During In Vitro Fertilization (IVF)

**Rationale**
Some people need help to have a baby. They may use fertility treatments like in vitro fertilization, or IVF. In IVF, a woman takes hormone shots. These shots help her body make several eggs at one time. Doctors then collect these eggs to use them to create a pregnancy.

During this process, it is very important that the body does not release the eggs too early. If the eggs are released before the doctor can collect them, the treatment cycle will not work. This can be very hard for patients.

To prevent this early release, doctors use a special medicine. This medicine is a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist, or GnRHa. It helps doctors control the timing for when the eggs are ready.

Doctors have different plans for giving this medicine. Some plans start the medicine a long time before the hormone shots. Other plans start the medicine at the same time as the shots. Researchers did this study to see if one plan works better than another to help women get pregnant.

**Trial Design**
This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of 37 older studies that had already been done. By combining the results, they hoped to get a clearer answer.

These older studies included a total of 3,872 women. All the women were getting fertility treatments like IVF. In these studies, women were put into groups by chance. Each group got the medicine in a different way.

The main comparison was between a “long plan” and a “short plan.”
*   In the long plan, women took the control medicine for at least two weeks before starting the hormone shots.
*   In the short plan, women started the control medicine and the hormone shots at around the same time.

The length of treatment for each woman depended on which plan she was on in her study.

**Results**
The main finding was about the number of babies born. When researchers compared the long plan and the short plan, they did not find a clear difference in the number of live births.

To make this easier to understand, think of 100 women using the short plan. About 14 of them would have a baby. If 100 women used the long plan, between 13 and 23 of them would have a baby. Because this range is wide and includes the result from the short plan, we cannot be sure that one plan is better than the other for having a baby.

However, the researchers did see a possible benefit with the long plan. They found that more women on the long plan had a ""clinical pregnancy."" This is a pregnancy that is confirmed with an ultrasound test early on.

The researchers also noted that the information from the old studies was not perfect. Many studies were old and did not report their results clearly. Because of this, the quality of the evidence was low to medium. There was not enough information to say anything about the side effects of the different plans.

The study team concluded that more research is needed. New studies could help find the best way to use this medicine. These studies should also look at what plan is lower in cost and which plan women find easier to follow.","Gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) used as an adjuvant to gonadotrophins in assisted reproduction treatments

10.1002-14651858.CD012665.pub2,"Bilateral (two) versus unilateral (one) hearing aid(s) for bilateral hearing impairment in adults 
Review question 
Should adult patients with bilateral (two‐sided) hearing loss be fitted with one or two hearing aids? 
Background 
Hearing loss can be present from birth or can come on in later life. The latter is called 'acquired' hearing loss and is common. Its incidence increases markedly with age. In most people, 'age‐related' hearing loss is due to the loss of cells in the inner ear (so called 'sensorineural hearing loss') and affects both ears to the same degree. Hearing loss categorised as mild, moderate or severe is primarily managed with hearing aids. People with bilateral hearing loss may be offered one aid, fitted to one specific ear, or two aids fitted to both ears. There is uncertainty about the relative benefits to patients of these different strategies. 
Study characteristics 
We included four studies with a total of 209 patients, ranging in age from 23 to 85 and with more men than women. All the studies allowed the use of hearing aids for a total period of at least eight weeks before questions were asked about their preference for one or two aids. In all the studies the patients had bilateral hearing loss but there was considerable variation in what type of hearing loss they suffered from and how bad their hearing was. 
Three of the studies were published before the mid‐1990s and the fourth study was published in 2011. Therefore, only the most recent study used 'modern' hearing aids similar to those that are widely available in high‐income countries. Of the four studies, two were conducted in the UK in National Health Service (NHS – public sector) patients. One of these looked at patients from primary care whose hearing loss had been picked up by a screening programme. The other looked at patients whose primary care practitioner thought they might benefit from hearing aids so had referred them to the local ENT department to get them. The other two studies were conducted in the United States: one study recruited only people on active military duty, or who had served in the military and had hearing loss due to being exposed to loud noises. About half of the people in the other study were ex‐military. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
Only one of the outcomes we thought was most important ‐ patient preference ‐ was reported in all studies. The percentage of patients who preferred two hearing aids to one varied between studies: this was 54% (51 out of 94), 39% (22 out of 56), 55% (16 out of 29) and 77% (23 out of 30), respectively. We did not combine the numbers from these four studies because it would not have been right to do so. We graded the quality of evidence for this outcome as very low on a scale that goes high – medium – low – very low. There was no information in the four studies on the other outcomes we were interested in. 
Conclusions 
This review identified only four studies comparing the use of one hearing aid with two. The studies were small and included people of widely varying ages. There was also considerable variation in the types of their deafness and in how deaf they were. 
For the most part, the types of hearing aid evaluated would now be regarded, in high‐income countries, as 'old technology', with only one study looking at 'modern' digital aids. However, we do not know if this is relevant or not. This review did not look at the differences between other 'old' and 'new' types of hearing aid. 
We could not combine the numbers from the four studies. Overall, this fact and the very low quality of the evidence leads us to conclude that we do not know if patients have a preference for one aid or two. Similarly, we do not know if a patient's quality of life is better with one or two aids.

Is one hearing aid better than two for adults with hearing loss in both ears?

### **Rationale**

Hearing loss is a common problem. It often happens as people get older. Many people have hearing loss in both of their ears. This can make it hard to talk with others and enjoy daily life.

Hearing aids are small devices that can help people hear better. When someone has hearing loss in both ears, a doctor may suggest one hearing aid for one ear. Or, they may suggest two hearing aids, one for each ear. Doctors and patients are not sure which way is better.

This study looked at past research to find an answer. The main goal was to see if using two hearing aids is better than using just one. Researchers wanted to know what patients liked more. They also wanted to know if two aids improved life more than one.

### **Trial Design**

This was a review study. This means researchers did not do a new test. Instead, they looked at the results of older studies that had already been done.

They found four studies to review. In total, 209 adults were in these studies. The group included both men and women. Their ages were between 23 and 85 years old. Everyone in the studies had hearing loss in both ears.

In each study, people tried using one hearing aid and then two hearing aids. They used the aids for at least two months. After that time, researchers asked them which option they liked more.

The studies were done in the United States and the United Kingdom. Most of the studies were old. They used hearing aids that are not common today. Only one of the four studies used modern, digital hearing aids.

### **Results**

The main result was about what patients liked best. The four studies did not all have the same results. The number of people who liked two hearing aids better than one was different in each study.

*   In the first study, about 54 out of 100 people liked two aids more.
*   In the second study, 39 out of 100 people liked two aids more.
*   In the third study, 16 out of 29 people liked two aids more.
*   In the last study, 23 out of 30 people liked two aids more.

The researchers said that the proof from these studies was very weak. The studies were small and were very different from each other. Because of this, the researchers could not combine the results to get one clear answer.

The studies did not report on other important things. For example, they did not say if using two hearing aids helped people feel better or enjoy life more.

In the end, this review could not answer the main question. We still do not know if one hearing aid is better than two for adults with hearing loss in both ears. The proof we have now is not strong enough to be sure. More and better research is needed to help patients and doctors make the best choice.","Bilateral (two) versus unilateral (one) hearing aid(s) for bilateral hearing impairment in adults

10.1002-14651858.CD013212.pub2,"Background
Hypertension is a major public health challenge affecting more than one billion people worldwide; it disproportionately affects populations in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs), where health systems are generally weak. The increasing prevalence of hypertension is associated with population growth, ageing, genetic factors, and behavioural risk factors, such as excessive salt and fat consumption, physical inactivity, being overweight and obese, harmful alcohol consumption, and poor management of stress. Over the long term, hypertension leads to risk for cardiovascular events, such as heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, disability, and premature mortality. 
Cardiovascular events can be preventable when high‐risk populations are targeted, for example, through population‐wide screening strategies. When available resources are limited, taking a total risk approach whereby several risk factors of hypertension are taken into consideration (e.g. age, gender, lifestyle factors, diabetes, blood cholesterol) can enable more accurate targeting of high‐risk groups. Targeting of high‐risk groups can help reduce costs in that resources are not spent on the entire population. 
Early detection in the form of screening for hypertension (and associated risk factors) can help identify high‐risk groups, which can result in timely treatment and management of risk factors. Ultimately, early detection can help reduce morbidity and mortality linked to it and can help contain health‐related costs, for example, those associated with hospitalisation due to severe illness and poorly managed risk factors and comorbidities. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of different screening strategies for hypertension (mass, targeted, or opportunistic) to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension. 
Search methods
An Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS‐Web), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) Bireme, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) without language, publication year, or publication status restrictions. The searches were conducted from inception until 9 April 2020. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non‐RCTs (NRCTs), that is, controlled before and after (CBA), interrupted time series (ITS), and prospective analytic cohort studies of healthy adolescents, adults, and elderly people participating in mass, targeted, or opportunistic screening of hypertension. 
Data collection and analysis
Screening of all retrieved studies was done in Covidence. A team of reviewers, in pairs, independently assessed titles and abstracts of identified studies and acquired full texts for studies that were potentially eligible. Studies were deemed to be eligible for full‐text screening if two review authors agreed, or if consensus was reached through discussion with a third review author. It was planned that at least two review authors would independently extract data from included studies, assess risk of bias using pre‐specified Cochrane criteria, and conduct a meta‐analysis of sufficiently similar studies or present a narrative synthesis of the results. 
Main results
We screened 9335 titles and abstracts. We identified 54 potentially eligible studies for full‐text screening. However, no studies met the eligibility criteria. 
Authors' conclusions
There is an implicit assumption that early detection of hypertension through screening can reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality, but this assumption has not been tested in rigorous research studies. High‐quality evidence from RCTs or programmatic evidence from NRCTs on the effectiveness and costs or harms of different screening strategies for hypertension (mass, targeted, or opportunistic) to reduce hypertension‐related morbidity and mortality is lacking.

Does Checking for High Blood Pressure Help People Live Longer? A Search for Answers

### Rationale

**What is high blood pressure?**

High blood pressure is a health problem that affects many people all over the world. It is also called hypertension. It happens when the force of blood pushing against the walls of your blood vessels is too high. Think of it like too much air in a tire.

Over time, this high pressure can damage your body. It can lead to serious problems like heart disease, strokes, and kidney failure. These problems can cause people to get very sick or to die early.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Many things can cause high blood pressure. Some people get it because it runs in their family. Other causes are related to our daily lives. These include eating too much salt, not getting enough exercise, and being under a lot of stress.

Doctors believe that finding high blood pressure early is a good idea. This is done through ""screening,"" which means checking people for a health problem before they feel sick. The hope is that if we find high blood pressure early, we can treat it. Treatment could stop more serious health problems from happening later.

The researchers in this study wanted to see if this is true. They wanted to find out if screening for high blood pressure really helps people live longer, healthier lives. They looked for proof that screening works.

### Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a study that involved new patients. Instead, the researchers looked for studies that were already finished. This kind of study is called a review.

The team made a plan to find every study ever done on screening for high blood pressure. They searched large computer databases that store medical studies from all over the world. They looked for studies written in any language and from any year up to April 2020.

The researchers were looking for specific kinds of studies. They wanted to find studies that looked at healthy teens, adults, and older people. These studies needed to test one of three ways of screening:

1.  **Mass screening:** Checking everyone in a large group.
2.  **Targeted screening:** Checking only people who are at a high risk.
3.  **Opportunistic screening:** Checking people when they see a doctor for some other reason.

The plan was to gather all the good studies they found. Then, they would combine the results to get one clear answer about screening.

### Results

**What were the main results of the study?**

The research team started by looking at the titles of over 9,000 studies. From that large number, they found 54 studies that looked promising. They read these 54 studies very carefully to see if they fit the plan.

After a close look, the researchers found that none of the studies met their needs. Not a single study could be used in their review. This was a very surprising result. It means the researchers could not find any good studies that tested if screening for high blood pressure saves lives.

**What does this mean for patients?**

Because no studies were found, we still do not have strong proof that screening helps. We believe that checking people for high blood pressure is a good thing. But this review shows that this belief has not been tested with the best kind of research.

The researchers concluded that we need new, high-quality studies. These studies must be done to find out for sure if screening for high blood pressure helps people. They can also tell us if screening has any downsides or costs. With this knowledge, doctors and health leaders can make better decisions to keep people healthy.","Screening strategies for hypertension
Review question 
What effects do the different ways of screening for hypertension (mass, targeted, or opportunistic) have in decreasing illness and death? 
Background 
Hypertension is a long‐term non‐communicable disease (NCD), also known as high, raised, or elevated blood pressure. Blood pressure is expressed by two measurements (systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) pressures), which are the maximum and minimum pressures. High blood pressure is generally diagnosed when resting blood pressure is persistently at SBP ≥ 130/140 millimetres mercury (mmHg) or at DBP ≥ 80/90 mmHg for adults. 
Even though blood pressure in the arteries is continuously raised, in many cases, high blood pressure does not cause symptoms. Nonetheless, hypertension can increase the risk for heart failure, stroke, vision loss, and chronic kidney disease, and so on, in the long term. People who have unhealthy diets, consume harmful amounts of alcohol and/or tobacco, and are physically inactive are at higher risk of hypertension. 
Early detection, adequate treatment, and good control of high blood pressure can lower the risk of complications associated with hypertension. Although early detection through screening of hypertension has the potential to contain health‐related costs, reducing the burden of hypertension will to some extent involve addressing behavioural and socioeconomic risk factors (such as income, occupation, and level of education). Therefore, it is unclear whether early detection of mild hypertension can positively impact health‐related costs in the long term and improve health outcomes by reducing the need for hospitalisation and management of hypertension‐related complications, which can be severe. 
Review methods 
We searched various electronic databases on this topic until 9 April 2020. We searched for studies written in any language, whether published or not. We planned to include studies that compared one type of screening strategy for hypertension versus no screening strategy, that is, mass screening versus no screening, targeted screening versus no screening, and opportunistic screening versus no screening. We were interested in studies in which participants were healthy adolescents, adults, and elderly people, and in which researchers measured clinical outcomes, health system outcomes, and adverse events. 
Key results 
We found no studies that met the criteria described above.
Quality of the evidence 
High‐certainty evidence that can tell us whether mass, targeted, or opportunistic screening strategies are effective for reducing illness and death associated with hypertension is lacking.

Spasticity and chronic neuropathic pain are common and serious symptoms in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). These symptoms increase with disease progression and lead to worsening disability, impaired activities of daily living and quality of life. Anti‐spasticity medications and analgesics are of limited benefit or poorly tolerated. Cannabinoids may reduce spasticity and pain in people with MS. Demand for symptomatic treatment with cannabinoids is high. A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding benefits and harms of these drugs is required. 
Objectives
To assess benefit and harms of cannabinoids, including synthetic, or herbal and plant‐derived cannabinoids, for reducing symptoms for adults with MS. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases from inception to December 2021: MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library), CINAHL (EBSCO host), LILACS, the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the US National Institutes of Health clinical trial register, the European Union Clinical Trials Register, the International Association for Cannabinoid Medicines databank. We hand searched citation lists of included studies and relevant reviews. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised parallel or cross‐over trials (RCTs) evaluating any cannabinoid (including herbal Cannabis, Cannabis flowers, plant‐based cannabinoids, or synthetic cannabinoids) irrespective of dose, route, frequency, or duration of use for adults with MS. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane Risk of bias 2 tool for parallel RCTs and crossover trials. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: reduction of 30% in the spasticity Numeric Rating Scale, pain relief of 50% or greater in the Numeric Rating Scale‐Pain Intensity, much or very much improvement in the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), Health‐Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), withdrawals due to adverse events (AEs) (tolerability), serious adverse events (SAEs), nervous system disorders, psychiatric disorders, physical dependence. 
Main results
We included 25 RCTs with 3763 participants of whom 2290 received cannabinoids. Age ranged from 18 to 60 years, and between 50% and 88% participants across the studies were female.  The included studies were 3 to 48 weeks long and compared nabiximols, an oromucosal spray with a plant derived equal (1:1) combination of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) (13 studies), synthetic cannabinoids mimicking THC (7 studies), an oral THC extract of Cannabis sativa (2 studies), inhaled herbal Cannabis (1 study) against placebo. One study compared dronabinol, THC extract of Cannabis sativa and placebo, one compared inhaled herbal Cannabis, dronabinol and placebo. We identified eight ongoing studies. 
Critical outcomes 
• Spasticity: nabiximols probably increases the number of people who report an important reduction of perceived severity of spasticity compared with placebo (odds ratio (OR) 2.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.56 to 4.04; 5 RCTs, 1143 participants; I2 = 67%; moderate‐certainty evidence). The absolute effect was 216 more people (95% CI 99 more to 332 more) per 1000 reporting benefit with cannabinoids than with placebo. 
• Chronic neuropathic pain: we found only one small trial that measured the number of participants reporting substantial pain relief with a synthetic cannabinoid compared with placebo (OR 4.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 16.17; 1 study, 48 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether cannabinoids reduce chronic neuropathic pain intensity. 
• Treatment discontinuation due to AEs: cannabinoids may increase slightly the number of participants who discontinue treatment compared with placebo (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.51 to 3.84; 21 studies, 3110 participants; I² = 17%; low‐certainty evidence); the absolute effect is 39 more people (95% CI 15 more to 76 more) per 1000 people. 
Important outcomes 
• PGIC: cannabinoids probably increase the number of people who report 'very much' or 'much' improvement in health status compared with placebo (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.36; 8 studies, 1215 participants; I² = 0%; moderate‐certainty evidence). The absolute effect is 113 more people (95% CI 57 more to 175 more) per 1000 people reporting improvement. 
• HRQoL: cannabinoids may have little to no effect on HRQoL (SMD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐0.17 to 0.02; 8 studies, 1942 participants; I2 = 0%; low‐certainty evidence); 
• SAEs: cannabinoids may result in little to no difference in the number of participants who have SAEs compared with placebo (OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.99; 20 studies, 3124 participants; I² = 0%; low‐certainty evidence); 
• AEs of the nervous system: cannabinoids may increase nervous system disorders compared with placebo (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.53 to 4.44; 7 studies, 1154 participants; I² = 63%; low‐certainty evidence); 
• Psychiatric disorders: cannabinoids may increase psychiatric disorders compared with placebo (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.88; 6 studies, 1122 participants; I² = 0%; low‐certainty evidence); 
• Drug tolerance: the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of cannabinoids on drug tolerance (OR 3.07, 95% CI 0.12 to 75.95; 2 studies, 458 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Compared with placebo, nabiximols probably reduces the severity of spasticity in the short‐term in people with MS. We are uncertain about the effect on chronic neurological pain and health‐related quality of life. Cannabinoids may increase slightly treatment discontinuation due to AEs, nervous system and psychiatric disorders compared with placebo. We are uncertain about the effect on drug tolerance. The overall certainty of evidence is limited by short‐term duration of the included studies.

Can Medicines from the Cannabis Plant Help with Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis?

### **Rationale**

Multiple Sclerosis, or MS, is a long-term health condition. It can cause many problems. Two common problems are stiff muscles and long-term nerve pain. Stiff muscles are also called spasticity. These problems can make daily life hard and lower a person's quality of life.

The usual medicines for stiff muscles and nerve pain do not always work well. Sometimes, they cause side effects that are hard to live with. Because of this, many people with MS are interested in other treatments.

Researchers think that medicines made from the cannabis plant might help. These are called cannabinoids. This study looked at past research to see if these medicines really help with MS symptoms. It also looked to see if they are safe to use.

### **Trial Design**

This was a review of many studies. Researchers looked at the results of 25 different studies. In total, these studies included about 3,800 adults with MS. The people in the studies were between 18 and 60 years old. Most of them were women.

In each study, people were put into groups by chance. One group took a medicine made from the cannabis plant. The other group took a placebo. A placebo is a dummy treatment, like a sugar pill, with no real medicine in it. This helps researchers see if the real medicine works.

The types of cannabis medicines were different. Some were a mouth spray. Others were pills or were inhaled. The studies lasted for different amounts of time, from 3 weeks to about one year.

### **Results**

**Did the medicines help?**

For stiff muscles, a mouth spray made from the cannabis plant seemed to help. Out of 1000 people who took the spray, 216 more people felt their stiff muscles got better compared to those who took the placebo.

People who took cannabis medicines were also more likely to feel that their health had improved ""much"" or ""very much"". For every 1000 people, 113 more people felt much better with the real medicine than with the placebo.

For long-term nerve pain, the researchers were not sure if the medicines helped. There was not enough information to know for sure. The medicines also seemed to have little or no effect on a person’s overall quality of life.

**Were the medicines safe?**

Some people had unwanted effects from the medicines, also known as side effects. More people who took the cannabis medicines stopped the study because of side effects. For every 1000 people, 39 more people stopped treatment compared to the placebo group.

Side effects included problems with the nervous system, like feeling dizzy. There were also more mental health problems, like feeling confused. There was no real difference in very serious side effects between the groups.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

The researchers found that a cannabis mouth spray probably helps reduce stiff muscles for people with MS in the short term. However, it is not clear if these medicines help with long-term nerve pain.

The medicines may cause more side effects that make people stop taking them. The studies were short, so we do not know the long-term effects. More research is needed to understand the best way to use these medicines for MS.","Cannabis and cannabinoids for people with multiple sclerosis
Key messages• Treatment with nabiximols likely results in improvement of spasticity and may not increase serious harmful effects compared with placebo 
• Compared with placebo, cannabinoids (nabiximols, Cannabis extract, synthetic cannabinoids) likely improve well‐being when measured with patient‐reported outcomes  
• Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefit of these medicines for treating chronic neuropathic pain is unclear. 
What is the issue? 
Many people with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience spasticity that causes also pain and impacts on the ability to carry out daily activities. Spasticity is a form of increased muscle tone. Cannabis‐based medicines refer to the use of Cannabis, or its ingredients called cannabinoids, as medical therapies to alleviate spasticity, chronic pain and other symptoms in MS. An international survey found that MS was one of the five medical conditions for which Cannabis was most often used. Another survey conducted in the UK found that more than one in five people with MS reported they had used Cannabis to try to manage their symptoms.  
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if cannabinoids were better than placebo in adults with MS to improve: 
• spasticity;
• chronic neuropathic pain;
• well‐being,
We also wanted to find out if cannabinoids were associated with:
• treatment discontinuation due to unwanted effects; 
• serious harmful effects;
• nervous system disorders or psychiatric disorders;
• drug tolerance defined as a condition that occurs when the body gets used to a medicine so that more medicine is needed. 
What did we do?We searched for studies that compared cannabinoids against placebo in adult people with MS. We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and certainty of evidence. 
What did we find?  
We found 25 studies that involved 3763 people with MS, 2290 of whom received cannabinoids. Fifteen studies were very short term or short‐term studies (two to 12 weeks), seven were intermediate term (12 to 26 weeks), and two were long term (50 and 156 weeks). One study reported results at three days only. The biggest study was conducted in 657 people and the smallest study involved 14 people. Most studies were done in European countries. Thirteen studies evaluated an oral spray (nabiximols) containing two compounds derived from the Cannabis plant. The other studies compared different cannabinoids with placebo. Pharmaceutical companies funded 15 of the studies. 
Main results 
Compared with placebo, cannabinoids: 
• probably increase the number of people who report an important reduction of perceived severity of spasticity for up to 14 weeks (evidence from five studies in 1143 people); 
• may increase the number of people who report an important reduction of perceived severity of chronic neuropathic pain, but the evidence is very uncertain (evidence from one study in 48 people). 
We are uncertain whether cannabinoids reduce chronic neuropathic pain intensity:
• probably increase the number of people who perceive their well‐being as 'very much' or 'much' improved (evidence from eight studies in 1215 people); 
• may increase slightly the number of people who discontinue treatment due to unwanted effects (evidence from 21 studies in 3110 people); 
• may result in little to no difference in the number of people who have serious harmful effects (evidence from 20 studies in 3124 people); 
• may increase nervous system disorders (evidence from seven studies in 1154 people) or psychiatric disorders (evidence from six studies in 1122 people); 
• may have little to no effect on the number of people who have drug tolerance, but the evidence is very uncertain (two studies in 458 people). 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
There is no high‐quality evidence. 
We are moderately confident that cannabinoids work better versus no cannabinoids to improve severity of spasticity and well‐being in adults with MS. We have little confidence in our results for the effect on chronic neuropathic pain because the available evidence is limited. 
There is limited evidence to determine the effects of cannabinoids on serious harmful effects, nervous system or psychiatric disorders, and drug tolerance.

Age‐related cataract affects both eyes in most cases. Most people undergo cataract surgery in both eyes on separate days, referred to as delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery (DSBCS). An alternative procedure involves operating on both eyes on the same day, but as two separate procedures, known as immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS). Potential advantages of ISBCS include fewer hospital visits for the patient, faster visual recovery, and lower healthcare costs. Nevertheless, concerns exist about possible bilateral, postoperative, sight‐threatening adverse effects with ISBCS. Therefore, there is a clear need for evaluating evidence regarding the safety, effectiveness, and cost‐effectiveness of ISBCS versus DSBCS. 
Objectives
To assess the safety of ISBCS compared to DSBCS in people with bilateral age‐related cataracts and to summarise current evidence for the incremental resource use, utilities, costs, and cost‐effectiveness associated with the use of ISBCS compared to DSBCS in people with bilateral age‐related cataracts (primary objectives). The secondary objective was to assess visual and patient‐reported outcomes of ISBCS compared to DSBCS in people with bilateral age‐related cataracts. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2021, Issue 5); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov; the WHO ICTRP; and DARE and NHS EED on the CRD Database on 11 May 2021. There were no language restrictions. We limited the searches to a date range of 2007 onwards. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess complications, refractive outcomes, best‐corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) and patient‐reported outcome measures (PROMs) with ISBCS compared to DSBCS. We included non‐randomised (NRSs), prospective, and retrospective cohort studies comparing ISBCS and DSBCS for safety assessment, because of the rare incidence of important adverse events. To assess cost‐effectiveness of ISBCS compared to DSBCS, we included both full and partial economic evaluations, and both trial‐based and model‐based economic evaluations. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures and assessed risk of bias for NRSs using the ROBINS‐I tool. For cost‐evaluations, we used the CHEC‐list, the CHEERS‐checklist, and the NICE‐checklist to investigate risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence with the GRADE tool. We reported results for economic evaluations narratively. 
Main results
We included 14 studies in the review; two RCTs, seven NRSs, and six economic evaluations (one study was both an NRS and economic evaluation). The studies reported on 276,260 participants (7384 for ISBCS and 268,876 for DSBCS) and were conducted in Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Iran, (South) Korea, Spain (Canary Islands), Sweden, the UK, and the USA. Overall, we considered the included RCTs to be at 'high to some concerns' risk of bias for complications, 'some concerns' risk of bias for refractive outcomes and visual acuity, and 'high' risk of bias for PROMs. The overall risk of bias for NRSs was graded 'serious' regarding complications and 'serious to critical' regarding refractive outcomes.  
With regard to endophthalmitis, we found that relative effects were estimated imprecisely and with low certainty, so that relative estimates were not reliable. Nonetheless, we found a very low risk of endophthalmitis in both ISBCS (1/14,076 participants) and DSBCS (55/556,246 participants) groups. Based on descriptive evidence and partially weak statistical evidence we found no evidence of an increased risk of endophthalmitis with ISBCS. Regarding refractive outcomes, we found moderate‐certainty (RCTs) and low‐certainty (NRSs) evidence there was no difference in the percentage of eyes that did not achieve refraction within 1.0 dioptre of target one to three months after surgery (RCTs: risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.26; NRSs: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.75). Similarly, postoperative complications did not differ between groups (RCTs: RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.52 to 3.40; NRSs: 1.04, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.29), although the certainty of this evidence was very low for both RCTs and NRSs. Furthermore, we found low‐certainty (RCTs) to very low‐certainty (NRSs) evidence that total costs per participant were lower for ISBCS compared to DSBCS, although results of individual studies could not be pooled. Only one study reported on cost‐effectiveness. This study found that ISBCS is cost‐effective compared to DSBCS, but did not measure quality‐adjusted life years using preferred methods and calculated costs erroneously. Finally, regarding secondary outcomes, we found limited evidence on BCDVA (data of two RCTs could not be pooled, although both studies individually found no difference between groups (very low‐certainty evidence)). Regarding PROMs, we found moderate‐certainty evidence (RCTs only) that there was no difference between groups one to three months after surgery (standardised mean difference −0.08, 95% CI −0.19 to 0.03). 
Authors' conclusions
Current evidence supports there are probably no clinically important differences in outcomes between ISBCS and DSBCS, but with lower costs for ISBCS. However, the amount of evidence is limited, and the certainty of the evidence was graded moderate to very low. In addition, there is a need for well‐designed cost‐effectiveness studies.

Comparing Two Ways to Do Cataract Surgery on Both Eyes

### **Rationale**

As people get older, the lens in their eye can get cloudy. This is called a cataract. Cataracts make it hard to see clearly. They can make colors look faded or cause blurry vision. For most people, cataracts happen in both eyes.

Surgery is the best way to fix cataracts. During surgery, a doctor removes the cloudy lens and puts in a new, clear one. When a person needs surgery on both eyes, doctors can do it in two main ways.

One way is to operate on one eye, and then have the person come back on a different day to operate on the second eye.

The other way is to operate on both eyes on the same day. The doctor does two separate surgeries, one for each eye, during one visit.

Having surgery on both eyes on the same day could be good for patients. It means fewer trips to the hospital. Patients might get back to their normal life faster. This method could also save money for the health care system.

However, some doctors have worried about the safety of same-day surgery. There is a very small risk of a serious eye infection after any surgery. If this happened with same-day surgery, it could affect both eyes at once. Researchers did this study to look at the evidence. They wanted to see if same-day surgery is as safe and effective as surgery done on two different days.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new medical study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked for and reviewed studies that were already done. This helps bring together all the information we know on a topic.

The researchers found 14 studies that compared the two types of cataract surgery. In total, these studies included information from over 276,000 people who had cataracts in both eyes.

These studies took place in many different countries. The researchers looked at the results from all of them. They wanted to find out what these studies said about the safety, vision results, and cost of each type of surgery.

### **Results**

The researchers found that having surgery on both eyes on the same day seems to be a good option for patients. The results were very similar to having surgery on two different days.

Here is what the study found:

*   **Safety:** The researchers looked closely at the risk of a serious eye infection. This type of infection is very rare for either type of surgery. They found no proof that the risk of infection was higher for patients who had same-day surgery. The risk was very low for everyone.
*   **Other Problems:** The risk of having other problems after surgery was also about the same for both groups.
*   **Vision:** After the surgery, people in both groups could see about the same. Both types of surgery worked well to improve vision.
*   **Patient Feedback:** Patients in both groups reported that they felt about the same after their surgery.
*   **Cost:** The studies showed that having surgery on both eyes on the same day cost less money for the health care system. This is because it takes fewer hospital visits and less staff time.

In conclusion, the authors of the review found that same-day surgery for both eyes is likely just as safe and effective as surgery on two different days. It also costs less.

The researchers noted that some of the studies they reviewed were not perfect. They believe that we need more, high-quality studies to be completely sure of these findings. This is especially true for studies that look at the cost savings.","Surgery on both eyes on the same day or on different days: which works better to treat cataract in both eyes? 
Key messages 
‐ Current evidence supports there may be no important difference between surgery on both eyes on the same day (ISBCS) and surgery on different days (DSBCS) for the following clinical outcomes: eye (ocular) infection (endophthalmitis, a severe, sight‐threatening but rare complication), spectacle correction after surgery (refraction), complications, vision with spectacle correction (if needed), and patient‐reported outcomes (PROMs; questionnaires on vision). 
‐ Current evidence supports the costs for ISBCS are lower compared to DSBCS, but evidence on the balance between the costs and how well it works (cost‐effectiveness) was lacking. 
‐ Overall, the amount and quality of the evidence was limited.
What is cataract and how is it treated? 
Age‐related cataract is a natural ageing process of the lens of the eye, in which the lens becomes cloudy and vision decreases. The only way to treat cataract is by surgery. During surgery, the clouded lens is removed and replaced by an artificial lens, implanted in the eye. Currently, most people undergo cataract surgery on both eyes on different days, with a period of days, weeks, or even months between surgeries, called delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery (DSBCS). However, it is also possible to have cataract surgery on both eyes on the same day, called immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS). 
Potential advantages to ISBCS include fewer visits to the hospital, faster visual recovery, and lower healthcare costs. However, there are also potential disadvantages, such as developing complications in both eyes. Also, in ISBCS, outcomes of the first eye cannot be used when performing second‐eye surgery, which may result in worse refractive outcomes (increased spectacle dependence). 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if cataract surgery on both eyes on the same day is as safe, effective, and cost‐effective as having surgery on both eyes on different days. 
What did we do?  
We searched for studies that looked at outcomes of ISBCS compared to DSBCS. We also searched for studies that looked at the balance between costs and outcomes for ISBCS compared to DSBCS (cost‐effectiveness). We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find?  
We found 14 studies that involved 276,260 people (7384 who had ISBCS and 268,876 who had DSBCS). The studies were conducted in Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Iran, (South) Korea, Spain (Canary Islands), Sweden, the UK, and the USA. Most studies lasted for around three months. 
Main results  
‐ Endophthalmitis: the type of surgery (ISBCS or DSBCS) may make little to no difference in the occurrence of endophthalmitis in one eye (up to six weeks after surgery). None of the studies reported endophthalmitis in both eyes, but this event is most likely too rare to be detected by these studies. 
‐ Refractive outcomes: there is probably little to no difference in refractive outcomes at one to three months after surgery with ISBCS compared to DSBCS. 
‐ Other complications: there may be little to no difference in other complications up to three months after surgery with ISBCS compared to DSBCS, but we are very uncertain about the results. 
‐ Costs: the economic studies in this review reported lower costs for ISBCS compared to DSBCS. One study reported that ISBCS is cost‐effective compared to DSBCS, but we are very uncertain about the results. 
‐ Best‐corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA; vision with spectacle correction if needed): the type of surgery (ISBCS or DSBCS) may have little to no effect on BCDVA at one to three months after surgery, but we are very uncertain about the results. 
‐ PROMs (measured in questionnaires): the type of surgery (ISBCS or DSBCS) probably makes little to no difference in PROMs at one to three months after surgery. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Overall, we had moderate to very little confidence in the evidence (endophthalmitis: little confidence, refractive outcomes: little to moderate confidence, complications: not confident, costs: little to no confidence, BCDVA: not confident, and PROMs: moderate confidence).  
Our confidence is limited because:
‐ the evidence on endophthalmitis was based on few cases of endophthalmitis;
‐ the studies assessed complications in different ways;
‐ there were not enough studies to be certain about refractive outcomes and complications;
‐ studies on costs reported costs for only one hospital and included different funding sources; 
‐ the studies assessed BCDVA in different ways and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results; 
‐ there were concerns regarding the possibility that people in the studies were aware of what treatment they were getting, and not all studies provided data about everything that we were interested in (most outcomes).

10.1002-14651858.CD013207.pub2,"Background
The standard method of diagnosing HIV in infants and children less than 18 months is with a nucleic acid amplification test reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test (NAT RT‐PCR) detecting viral ribonucleic acid (RNA). Laboratory testing using the RT‐PCR platform for HIV infection is limited by poor access, logistical support, and delays in relaying test results and initiating therapy in low‐resource settings. The use of rapid diagnostic tests at or near the point‐of‐care (POC) can increase access to early diagnosis of HIV infection in infants and children less than 18 months of age and timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). 
Objectives
To summarize the diagnostic accuracy of point‐of‐care nucleic acid‐based testing (POC NAT) to detect HIV‐1/HIV‐2 infection in infants and children aged 18 months or less exposed to HIV infection. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (until 2 February 2021), MEDLINE and Embase (until 1 February 2021), and LILACS and Web of Science (until 2 February 2021) with no language or publication status restriction. We also searched conference websites and clinical trial registries, tracked reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews, and consulted experts for potentially eligible studies. 
Selection criteria
We defined POC tests as rapid diagnostic tests conducted at or near the patient site. We included any primary study that compared the results of a POC NAT to a reference standard of laboratory NAT RT‐PCR or total nucleic acid testing to detect the presence or absence of HIV infection denoted by HIV viral nucleic acids in infants and children aged 18 months or less who were exposed to HIV‐1/HIV‐2 infection. We included cross‐sectional, prospective, and retrospective study designs and those that provided sufficient data to create the 2 × 2 table to calculate sensitivity and specificity. We excluded diagnostic case control studies with healthy controls. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted information on study characteristics using a pretested standardized data extraction form. We used the QUADAS‐2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) tool to assess the risk of bias and applicability concerns of the included studies. Two review authors independently selected and assessed the included studies, resolving any disagreements by consensus. The unit of analysis was the participant. We first conducted preliminary exploratory analyses by plotting estimates of sensitivity and specificity from each study on forest plots and in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space. For the overall meta‐analyses, we pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity using the bivariate meta‐analysis model at a common threshold (presence or absence of infection). 
Main results
We identified a total of 12 studies (15 evaluations, 15,120 participants). All studies were conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa. The ages of included infants and children in the evaluations were as follows: at birth (n = 6), ≤ 12 months (n = 3), ≤ 18 months (n = 5), and ≤ 24 months (n = 1). Ten evaluations were field evaluations of the POC NAT test at the point of care, and five were laboratory evaluations of the POC NAT tests.The POC NAT tests evaluated included Alere q HIV‐1/2 Detect qualitative test (recently renamed m‐PIMA q HIV‐1/2 Detect qualitative test) (n = 6), Xpert HIV‐1 qualitative test (n = 6), and SAMBA HIV‐1 qualitative test (n = 3). 
POC NAT pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% confidence interval (CI)) against laboratory reference standard tests were 98.6% (96.1 to 99.5) (15 evaluations, 1728 participants) and 99.9% (99.7 to 99.9) (15 evaluations, 13,392 participants) in infants and children ≤ 18 months. 
Risk of bias in the included studies was mostly low or unclear due to poor reporting. Five evaluations had some concerns for applicability for the index test, as they were POC tests evaluated in a laboratory setting, but there was no difference detected between settings in sensitivity (−1.3% (95% CI −4.1 to 1.5)); and specificity results were similar. 
Authors' conclusions
For the diagnosis of HIV‐1/HIV‐2 infection, we found the sensitivity and specificity of POC NAT tests to be high in infants and children aged 18 months or less who were exposed to HIV infection.

Are Fast HIV Tests for Babies as Good as Lab Tests? A Review of the Evidence

### **Rationale**

HIV is a virus that can make people very sick. If a mother has HIV, she can pass the virus to her baby. It is very important to find out if a baby has HIV soon after birth. This allows the baby to start life-saving medicine right away and live a long, healthy life.

The normal way to test a baby for HIV is with a special lab test. This test is very good at finding the virus. But it can cause problems in places with fewer resources. It can be hard to get to a lab. The test also takes a long time, and waiting for the results can cause delays.

This delay means that sick babies may not get the medicine they need most. Researchers wanted to know if a different, faster type of test could help. These are called “point-of-care” tests. This means the test can be done right in the clinic, close to the baby. The results come back very quickly, often on the same day.

This study was done to see if these fast tests are as good as the standard lab tests. The main goal was to check how accurate the fast tests are. Researchers wanted to know if doctors and nurses could trust these tests to find HIV in babies and young children.

### **Trial Design**

The researchers did not do a new study with patients. Instead, they looked for all the studies that had already been done on this topic. They gathered the results from many past studies and combined them. Looking at many studies together helps to get a stronger and more sure answer.

The researchers looked at 12 different studies. All of these studies took place in Africa. In total, the studies included over 15,000 babies and young children. All the children were 18 months old or younger. Their mothers had HIV, so the children were at risk of getting the virus.

Each of these studies compared a fast HIV test to the standard lab test. They checked to see if both tests gave the same result for each child. The fast tests were used in different places. Some were used in local clinics with the patients. Others were studied in a lab to check their quality.

### **Results**

The researchers combined the results from all 12 studies. They found that the fast, point-of-care tests were very accurate. They were very good at finding HIV when it was there. They were also very good at showing when HIV was not there.

The study looked at accuracy in two ways. First, how well did the tests find HIV in babies who had the virus? For every 100 babies who had HIV, the fast tests correctly found it in about 99 of them. This means the tests rarely miss a case of HIV.

Second, how well did the tests rule out HIV in babies who did not have it? The results were also very strong here. For every 1,000 babies who did not have HIV, the fast tests correctly showed they were virus-free in 999 of them. This means the tests rarely give a false alarm.

These results are very important. They show that fast tests work very well and are just as good as the slower lab tests. They can be used in clinics that are far from big labs. This allows doctors and nurses to test babies for HIV quickly and easily. Babies who have HIV can start their medicine much sooner.

The researchers concluded that fast HIV tests are highly accurate and can be trusted for babies and young children. Using these tests can help more children get tested early. This can lead to better care and a healthier life for children with HIV.","Point‐of‐care tests for detecting HIV viral molecules in infants and children aged 18 months or less 
Why is improving the diagnosis of HIV infection important? 
It is estimated that 1.5 million infants are still exposed to HIV every year. If left untreated, about 50% to 60% of HIV‐infected infants will die by the age of two years. Children infected before birth are especially at high risk of death. HIV is incurable; however, there are medications that suppress HIV, known as antiretroviral drugs (ART). When HIV is detected early, severe illness and death from HIV‐related infections can be prevented by taking this medication. A test that detects HIV viral genetic molecules quickly and accurately at or near the patient's side (point‐of‐care) therefore can increase access to early appropriate treatment and minimize missing treatments in those whose HIV remains undetected. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To determine the accuracy of molecular point‐of‐care tests for detecting the main types of HIV infection (HIV‐1/HIV‐2) in infants and children aged 18 months or less. 
What was studied in this review? 
Published reports of molecular point‐of‐care tests with results measured against laboratory viral‐based tests (benchmark). 
What are the main results of this review? 
Twelve studies which completed 15 evaluations involving 15,120 participants compared molecular point‐of‐care tests for diagnosing HIV infection. 
What are the strengths and limitations of this review? 
The review included sufficient studies and participants. All studies were conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa, making the results highly applicable for use in communities where the disease is regularly found and where disease control programmes are often targeted. However, one in three included evaluations of the molecular point‐of‐care tests were conducted in a laboratory setting and not near the patient but there was no difference in the test accuracy between settings. 
To whom do the results of this review apply? 
Infants and children aged 18 months or less who were exposed to HIV infection.
What are the implications of this review? 
In theory, for a population of 1000 children aged 18 months or less where 100 have HIV infection, 100 children will be positive with the molecular point‐of‐care test, of which one will not have the infection (false‐positive result), and 900 will be negative with the molecular point‐of‐care test, of which one will indeed have the infection (false‐negative result). 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence is current to 2 February 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013870.pub2,"Background
Atopic eczema (AE), also known as atopic dermatitis, is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that causes significant burden. Phototherapy is sometimes used to treat AE when topical treatments, such as corticosteroids, are insufficient or poorly tolerated. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of phototherapy for treating AE. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov to January 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials in adults or children with any subtype or severity of clinically diagnosed AE. Eligible comparisons were any type of phototherapy versus other forms of phototherapy or any other treatment, including placebo or no treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodology. For key findings, we used RoB 2.0 to assess bias, and GRADE to assess certainty of the evidence. Primary outcomes were physician‐assessed signs and patient‐reported symptoms. Secondary outcomes were Investigator Global Assessment (IGA), health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), safety (measured as withdrawals due to adverse events), and long‐term control. 
Main results
We included 32 trials with 1219 randomised participants, aged 5 to 83 years (mean: 28 years), with an equal number of males and females. Participants were recruited mainly from secondary care dermatology clinics, and study duration was, on average, 13 weeks (range: 10 days to one year). We assessed risk of bias for all key outcomes as having some concerns or high risk, due to missing data, inappropriate analysis, or insufficient information to assess selective reporting. 
Assessed interventions included: narrowband ultraviolet B (NB‐UVB; 13 trials), ultraviolet A1 (UVA1; 6 trials), broadband ultraviolet B (BB‐UVB; 5 trials), ultraviolet AB (UVAB; 2 trials), psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA; 2 trials), ultraviolet A (UVA; 1 trial), unspecified ultraviolet B (UVB; 1 trial), full spectrum light (1 trial), Saalmann selective ultraviolet phototherapy (SUP) cabin (1 trial), saltwater bath plus UVB (balneophototherapy; 1 trial), and excimer laser (1 trial). Comparators included placebo, no treatment, another phototherapy, topical treatment, or alternative doses of the same treatment. 
Results for key comparisons are summarised (for scales, lower scores are better):
NB‐UVB versus placebo/no treatment 
There may be a larger reduction in physician‐assessed signs with NB‐UVB compared to placebo after 12 weeks of treatment (mean difference (MD) ‐9.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3.62 to ‐15.18; 1 trial, 41 participants; scale: 0 to 90). Two trials reported little difference between NB‐UVB and no treatment (37 participants, four to six weeks of treatment); another reported improved signs with NB‐UVB versus no treatment (11 participants, nine weeks of treatment). 
NB‐UVB may increase the number of people reporting reduced itch after 12 weeks of treatment compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.72, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.69; 1 trial, 40 participants). Another trial reported very little difference in itch severity with NB‐UVB (25 participants, four weeks of treatment). 
The number of participants with moderate to greater global improvement may be higher with NB‐UVB than placebo after 12 weeks of treatment (RR 2.81, 95% CI 1.10 to 7.17; 1 trial, 41 participants). 
NB‐UVB may not affect rates of withdrawal due to adverse events. No withdrawals were reported in one trial of NB‐UVB versus placebo (18 participants, nine weeks of treatment). In two trials of NB‐UVB versus no treatment, each reported one withdrawal per group (71 participants, 8 to 12 weeks of treatment). 
We judged that all reported outcomes were supported with low‐certainty evidence, due to risk of bias and imprecision. No trials reported HRQoL. 
NB‐UVB versus UVA1 
We judged the evidence for NB‐UVB compared to UVA1 to be very low certainty for all outcomes, due to risk of bias and imprecision. There was no evidence of a difference in physician‐assessed signs after six weeks (MD ‐2.00, 95% CI ‐8.41 to 4.41; 1 trial, 46 participants; scale: 0 to 108), or patient‐reported itch after six weeks (MD 0.3, 95% CI ‐1.07 to 1.67; 1 trial, 46 participants; scale: 0 to 10). Two split‐body trials (20 participants, 40 sides) also measured these outcomes, using different scales at seven to eight weeks; they reported lower scores with NB‐UVB. One trial reported HRQoL at six weeks (MD 2.9, 95% CI ‐9.57 to 15.37; 1 trial, 46 participants; scale: 30 to 150). One split‐body trial reported no withdrawals due to adverse events over 12 weeks (13 participants). No trials reported IGA. 
NB‐UVB versus PUVA 
We judged the evidence for NB‐UVB compared to PUVA (8‐methoxypsoralen in bath plus UVA) to be very low certainty for all reported outcomes, due to risk of bias and imprecision. There was no evidence of a difference in physician‐assessed signs after six weeks (64.1% reduction with NB‐UVB versus 65.7% reduction with PUVA; 1 trial, 10 participants, 20 sides). There was no evidence of a difference in marked improvement or complete remission after six weeks (odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 7.89; 1 trial, 9/10 participants with both treatments). One split‐body trial reported no withdrawals due to adverse events in 10 participants over six weeks. The trials did not report patient‐reported symptoms or HRQoL. 
UVA1 versus PUVA 
There was very low‐certainty evidence, due to serious risk of bias and imprecision, that PUVA (oral 5‐methoxypsoralen plus UVA) reduced physician‐assessed signs more than UVA1 after three weeks (MD 11.3, 95% CI ‐0.21 to 22.81; 1 trial, 40 participants; scale: 0 to 103). The trial did not report patient‐reported symptoms, IGA, HRQoL, or withdrawals due to adverse events. 
There were no eligible trials for the key comparisons of UVA1 or PUVA compared with no treatment. 
Adverse events 
Reported adverse events included low rates of phototoxic reaction, severe irritation, UV burn, bacterial superinfection, disease exacerbation, and eczema herpeticum. 
Authors' conclusions
Compared to placebo or no treatment, NB‐UVB may improve physician‐rated signs, patient‐reported symptoms, and IGA after 12 weeks, without a difference in withdrawal due to adverse events. Evidence for UVA1 compared to NB‐UVB or PUVA, and NB‐UVB compared to PUVA was very low certainty. More information is needed on the safety and effectiveness of all aspects of phototherapy for treating AE.

Does Using Light Treatment Help with Eczema? A Review of Past Studies

### **Rationale**

**What is atopic eczema?**

Atopic eczema is a long-term skin problem. It is also known as atopic dermatitis. It can make your skin red, swollen, dry, and very itchy. Living with this condition can be hard.

**Why was this study done?**

Doctors often treat eczema with creams or ointments that are put on the skin. But these creams do not always work for everyone. Sometimes they can cause other problems. Because of this, doctors have looked for other ways to help.

One other treatment is called phototherapy, or light therapy. This treatment uses special types of light on the skin. This study looked at past research to see how well light therapy works to treat atopic eczema.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of 32 older studies. Looking at many studies at once can give a clearer picture of a treatment.

The studies they looked at were a special type called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, people are put into different groups by chance. Putting people into groups by chance is the fairest way to compare treatments.

**Who was in the studies?**

The 32 studies included a total of about 1,200 people. The people in the studies were children and adults, from 5 to 83 years old. About half were men and half were women. Everyone in the studies had atopic eczema.

**What treatments were compared?**

In the studies, some people got different types of light therapy. Other groups got a fake treatment called a placebo. A placebo looks like a real treatment but has no medicine in it. This helps show if the real treatment is working. Some groups got no treatment or used creams instead. People were in these studies for about 3 months on average.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

Researchers looked at many types of light therapy. One type they looked at closely was called narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB).

When they compared NB-UVB light therapy to a fake treatment or no treatment, they found a few things:
*   **What doctors saw:** Doctors who checked the skin thought it got better in people who had NB-UVB therapy.
*   **What patients felt:** More people who had NB-UVB therapy said their skin felt less itchy.
*   **Overall improvement:** More people in the NB-UVB group saw a good overall change in their skin.

**Did the treatment cause problems?**

The study also looked at side effects. People who had light therapy did not stop the studies more often than people who got fake treatment. Some side effects of light therapy were reported, like skin burns or redness. But these were not common.

**How sure are we about these results?**

The researchers said we cannot be very sure about these results. This is because many of the old studies were small. Some of the studies also had missing information or problems with how they were done. This makes the proof less strong.

When researchers compared different types of light therapy to each other, the results were not clear. We still do not know if one type of light therapy is better than another. The proof for these comparisons was very weak.

**What do the results mean?**

This review found that NB-UVB light therapy might help improve the skin and reduce itch for people with atopic eczema. However, we need more and better studies to be sure. Future studies will help us know for sure how well light therapy works and how safe it is for people with eczema.","What are the benefits and risks of light therapy for treating atopic eczema (also known as eczema or atopic dermatitis)? 
Key messages 
Narrowband (NB) ultraviolet B (UVB), compared to placebo (a sham treatment), may improve eczema severity (including itch) and may not affect the number of people leaving a study because of unwanted effects. 
We were unable to confidently draw conclusions for other phototherapy (light therapy) treatments. 
Future research needs to assess longer term effectiveness and safety of NB‐UVB and other forms of phototherapy for eczema. 
What is eczema? 
Eczema is a condition that results in dry, itchy patches of inflamed skin. Eczema typically starts in childhood, but can improve with age. Eczema is caused by a combination of genetics and environmental factors, which lead to skin barrier dysfunction. Eczema can negatively impact quality of life, and the societal cost is significant. 
How is eczema treated? 
Eczema treatments are often creams or ointments that reduce itch and redness, applied directly to the skin. If these are unsuccessful, systemic medicines that affect the whole body, or phototherapy are options. Phototherapy can be UVB, ultraviolet A (UVA), or photochemotherapy (PUVA), where phototherapy is given alongside substances that increase sensitivity to UV light. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out whether phototherapy was better than no treatment or other types of treatment for treating eczema, and whether it caused unwanted effects. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that investigated phototherapy compared with no treatment, placebo, other forms of phototherapy, or another type of eczema treatment. Studies could include people of all ages, who had eczema diagnosed by a healthcare professional. 
We compared and summarised the results of the studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence. 
What did we find? 
We found 32 studies, involving 1219 people with eczema (average age: 28 years), who were recruited from dermatology clinics. Most studies assessed people with skin type II to III (which is classed as white to medium skin colour), and moderate to severe eczema, with which they had lived for many years. Studies included similar numbers of males and females. 
The studies were conducted in Europe, Asia, and Egypt (setting was not reported by seven studies), and lasted, on average, for 13 weeks. Almost half of the studies reported their source of funding; two were linked to commercial sponsors. 
Our included studies mostly assessed NB‐UVB, followed by UVA1, then broadband ultraviolet B; fewer studies investigated other types of phototherapy. The studies compared these treatments to placebo, or no treatment, another type of phototherapy, different doses of the same sort of phototherapy, or other eczema treatments applied to the skin or taken by tablet. 
None of the studies investigated excimer lamp (a source of UV radiation) or heliotherapy (the use of natural sunlight), that were other light therapies in which we were interested. 
What are the main results of our review? 
When compared to placebo, NB‐UVB may:
‐ improve signs of eczema assessed by a healthcare professional (1 study, 41 people);
‐ increase the number of people reporting less severe itching (1 study, 41 people);
‐ increase the number of people reporting moderate or greater improvement of eczema, measured by the Investigator Global Assessment scale (IGA), a 5‐point scale that measures improvement in eczema symptoms (1 study, 40 people); and 
‐ have no effect on the rate of people withdrawing from treatment due to unwanted effects (3 studies, 89 people). 
None of the studies assessing NB‐UVB against placebo measured health‐related quality of life. 
We do not know if NB‐UVB (compared with UVA1 or PUVA) or UVA1 (compared with PUVA) has an effect on the following: 
‐ signs of eczema assessed by a healthcare professional;
‐ patient‐reported eczema symptoms;
‐ IGA;
‐ health‐related quality of life; and
‐ withdrawals due to unwanted effects.
This is because either we are not confident in the evidence, or they were not reported.
We did not identify any studies that investigated UVA1 or PUVA compared with no treatment.
Some studies reported that phototherapy caused some unwanted effects, including skin reactions or irritation, UV burn, worsening of eczema, and skin infections. However, these did not occur in most people. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the evidence is limited, mainly because only a few studies could be included in each comparison, and the studies generally involved only small numbers of people. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to January 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013446,"Background
Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy increases the risk of pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and low birthweight. In a previous Cochrane Review we found that supplementing pregnant women with vitamin D alone compared to no vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and low birthweight and may increase the risk of preterm births if it is combined with calcium. However the effects of different vitamin D regimens are not yet clear. 
Objectives
To assess the effects and safety of different regimens of vitamin D supplementation alone or in combination with calcium or other vitamins, minerals or nutrients during pregnancy, specifically doses of 601 international units per day (IU/d) or more versus 600 IU/d or less; and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (12 July 2018), and the reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials evaluating the effect of different vitamin D regimens (dose, frequency, duration, and time of commencement of supplementation during pregnancy), alone or in combination with other nutrients on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes. We only included trials that compared 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less. We did not include in the analysis groups that received no vitamin D, as that comparison is assessed in another Cochrane Review. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently: i) assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria; ii) extracted data from included studies, and iii) assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. Our primary maternal outcomes were: pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and any adverse effects; our primary infant outcomes were preterm birth and low birthweight. Data were checked for accuracy. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
In this review, we included data from 30 trials involving 7289 women. We excluded 11 trials, identified 16 ongoing/unpublished trials and two trials are awaiting classification. Overall risk of bias for the trials was mixed. 
Comparison 1. 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less of vitamin D alone or with any other nutrient (19 trials; 5214 participants) 
Supplementation with 601 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of pre‐eclampsia (risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.42); 5 trials; 1553 participants,low‐certainty evidence), may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.86; 5 trials; 1846 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), may make little or no difference to the risk of preterm birth (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.69; 4 trials; 2294 participants; low‐certainty evidence); and may make little or no difference to the risk of low birthweight (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.24; 4 trials; 1550 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) compared to women receiving 600 IU/d or less. 
Comparison 2. 4000 IU or more versus 3999 IU or less of vitamin D alone (15 trials; 4763 participants) 
Supplementation with 4000 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of: pre‐eclampsia (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.22; 4 trials, 1903 participants, low‐certainty evidence); gestational diabetes (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.42; 5 trials, 2276 participants; low‐certainty evidence); preterm birth (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.12; 6 trials, 2948 participants, low‐certainty evidence); and low birthweight (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.70; 2 trials; 1099 participants; low‐certainty evidence) compared to women receiving 3999 IU/d or less. 
Adverse events (such as hypercalcaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypercalciuria, and hypovitaminosis D) were reported differently in most trials; however, in general, there was little to no side effects reported or similar cases between groups. 
Authors' conclusions
Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes; however, it may make little or no difference to the risk of pre‐eclampsia, preterm birth and low birthweight. Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current upper limit for vitamin D seems not to increase the risk of the outcomes evaluated. In general, the GRADE was considered low certainty for most of the primary outcomes due to serious risk of bias and imprecision of results. With respect to safety, it appears that vitamin D supplementation is a safe intervention during pregnancy, although the parameters used to determine this were either not reported or not consistent between trials. Future trials should be consistent in their reports of adverse events. There are 16 ongoing trials that when published, will increase the body of knowledge.

Does taking more vitamin D during pregnancy help mothers and babies? A review of the research.

**Rationale**

Vitamin D is very important for your health. When a woman is pregnant, not having enough vitamin D can cause problems. It can raise the risk of serious health issues for both the mother and the baby.

These problems can include:
*   **Pre-eclampsia**: A type of high blood pressure that happens during pregnancy and can be dangerous.
*   **Gestational diabetes**: A kind of diabetes, or high blood sugar, that some women get when they are pregnant.
*   **Preterm birth**: When a baby is born too early.
*   **Low birthweight**: When a baby is born smaller than is healthy.

We know that taking extra vitamin D during pregnancy can help. But doctors are not sure what amount of vitamin D is best. This study looked at past research to see if taking higher amounts of vitamin D works better and is safe for pregnant women and their babies.

**Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, our team of researchers looked closely at the results of 30 previous studies. This is called a review. By combining the results, we can get a better and stronger answer.

About 7,300 pregnant women took part in these 30 studies. In each study, women were put into groups by chance. Some groups took a higher amount of vitamin D each day, while others took a lower amount.

We looked at two main comparisons:
1.  Women who took more than 600 units of vitamin D each day were compared to women who took 600 units or less.
2.  Women who took 4,000 units or more each day were compared to women who took less than 4,000 units.

The women took the vitamin D during their pregnancy. The researchers then checked on the health of the mothers and their babies.

**Results**

Here is what we learned from looking at all the studies.

**Taking more than 600 units of vitamin D per day:**
*   Women who took more than 600 units of vitamin D a day had a lower chance of getting gestational diabetes (high blood sugar during pregnancy).
*   However, taking this higher amount did not seem to change the risk of getting pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure).
*   It also did not seem to change the risk of having a baby born too early or a baby with a low weight.

**Taking 4,000 units or more of vitamin D per day:**
*   Taking a very high amount of vitamin D did not seem to lower the risk for any of the health problems we looked at.
*   The risks of pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and low birthweight were about the same for women who took very high amounts and women who took lower amounts.

**Was it safe?**
*   The studies showed very few side effects from taking vitamin D. Bad health effects were rare and were similar in all groups.
*   This suggests that taking higher amounts of vitamin D during pregnancy is likely safe for mothers and babies.

**What does this mean?**
*   Taking more vitamin D than what is normally recommended may help lower the risk of gestational diabetes.
*   The researchers noted that the proof from these studies was not very strong for most of the results. This means we need more research to be sure.
*   There are 16 more studies on this topic happening now. When they are finished, their results will help us learn even more about the best amount of vitamin D to take during pregnancy.","Regimens of vitamin D supplementation for women during pregnancy
What is the issue? 
This review evaluated if there are beneficial effects of supplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation (200 international units/day (IU/d) to 600 IU/d) on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes and to evaluate if there are negative health effects when using more than the current upper limit recommendation (4000 IU/d). 
Why is this important? 
Vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy compared to no supplementation appears to decrease the risk of pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birthweight and may reduce the risk of severe postpartum haemorrhage. However, it is not clear if doses greater than the currently recommended level are needed to observe these health benefits, and if giving more than the upper limit is related to adverse events. 
What was studied in the review? 
This review included trials evaluating the effect of different vitamin D regimens (doses, frequencies, duration, and times of commencement) to compare the effects of 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less, of vitamin D alone or with any other nutrient on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes. 
What evidence did we find? 
Evidence from 19 trials involving 5214 women suggest that supplementation with 601 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes but may make little or no difference to the risk of pre‐eclampsia, preterm birth or low birthweight compared to women receiving 600 IU/d or less. 
Evidence from 15 trials involving 4763 women suggests that supplementation with 4000 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth or low birthweight compared to women receiving 3999 IU/d or less. 
Adverse events were reported differently in most trials; in general, there was little to no side effects reported or similar cases between groups. 
What does this mean? 
Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes; however, it may make little or no difference in the risk of the other outcomes. Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current upper limit for vitamin D seems not to increase the risk of the outcomes evaluated. Vitamin D supplementation appears to be safe.

10.1002-14651858.CD000371.pub7,"Deworming school children in low‐ and middle‐income countries
Cochrane researchers examined the effects of deworming children in areas where intestinal worm infection is common. After searching for relevant trials up to 19 September 2018, we included 50 trials with a total of 84,336 participants, and an additional trial of one million children. 
What is deworming and why might it be important 
Soil‐transmitted worms, including roundworms, hookworms, and whipworms, are common in tropical and subtropical areas, and particularly affect children living in poverty where there is inadequate sanitation. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends that school children in many areas are regularly treated with drugs which kill these worms. Some advocates claim such programmes improve child growth, haemoglobin, cognition, school attendance, school performance, physical fitness, and survival. 
What the research says 
In populations of children living in endemic areas, the effect of the first, single dose of deworming drugs on weight is unclear. There was little or no effect in most studies, except for a large effect detected from one study area in Kenya, reported in two trials carried out over 30 years ago in a school where children were heavily infected with worms. This causes uncertainty, which means we do not know if a first dose or single dose of deworming impacts on weight. For height, most studies showed little or no effect, with the exception of the site in Kenya. A single dose of deworming medicine probably has no effect on haemoglobin and cognition. There is insufficient data to know if there is an effect on school attendance, school performance, or physical fitness or mortality. 
In studies where children were regularly treated with deworming medicine there was little or no effect on weight in all but two trials, irrespective of whether children were heavily infected with worms or not. The two trials with large average weight gains included the Kenya study carried out over 30 years ago, and one study from India carried out over 20 years ago in a low worm burden area where later studies in the same area did not show an effect. In trials from 2000 onwards, which are more relevant given the global reduction in worm burden, there is little or no effect. This causes uncertainty and means we do not know if regularly treating children with deworming medicine improves their weight. Regularly deworming children probably has no effect on height, haemoglobin, cognition, and mortality. We do not know if there is an impact on school attendance, since the evidence is inconsistent and at high risk of bias. There is insufficient data to know if there is an effect on physical fitness. 
Authors' conclusions 
For public health programmes to regularly treat all children in endemic areas with deworming drugs, there is quite substantial evidence of no benefit in terms of haemoglobin, cognition, school performance, and mortality. For weight, contemporary studies do not show an effect, but unusually large effects were seen in studies over 20 years ago.

Does giving medicine to kill worms help school children grow and learn?

**Rationale**

Some children get sick from tiny worms that can live inside their bodies. These worms are often found in the dirt in places with unclean water and bathrooms. Children who live in these areas can get the worms by accident.

Many health groups suggest that all school children in these areas should take medicine to kill the worms. This is called deworming. People hoped this medicine would help children in many ways. They thought it could help children grow bigger and taller. They also hoped it would improve children's blood health, help them think and learn better, and help them go to school more often.

Researchers wanted to check if this was true. They did a study to see if giving deworming medicine to children really helps them.

**Trial Design**

This was a special type of study. The researchers did not do a new test with new children. Instead, they gathered the results from 51 older studies that had already been done. By looking at all these studies together, they hoped to find a clear answer.

The studies included more than one million school children. These children lived in countries where worm infections are common.

The studies compared children who got the deworming medicine with children who did not. Some studies looked at what happened after children got the medicine just one time. Other studies looked at what happened when children took the medicine regularly over a long time.

**Results**

The researchers looked at what the studies found. They checked to see if the medicine helped children with their weight, height, blood health, and thinking.

Here is what they found when children got **one dose** of medicine:
*   **Weight and Height:** Most studies showed little or no change in a child's weight or height. One very old study from a place called Kenya did show a big change in weight. But the children in that study were very sick with worms. So, we are not sure if one dose of medicine helps with growth.
*   **Blood Health and Thinking:** A single dose of medicine probably did not help children's blood health. It also did not seem to help them with thinking or learning.
*   **School:** There was not enough information to know if the medicine helped children go to school more or do better in their classes.

Here is what they found when children got the medicine **many times**:
*   **Weight and Height:** Most of the newer studies found that the medicine had little or no effect on weight. The medicine also probably did not help children grow taller.
*   **Blood Health and Thinking:** Giving the medicine regularly probably did not improve children’s blood health. It also did not help with their thinking and learning.
*   **School and Survival:** We do not know if the medicine helped children go to school more often because the study results were not clear. The medicine did not seem to help children live longer.

The researchers concluded that there is strong proof that giving deworming medicine to all children does not help with their blood health, thinking skills, or school performance. For weight, only some very old studies from over 20 years ago showed a benefit. Newer studies do not show a benefit. This is important because worm infections are not as bad today as they were in the past.","Deworming school children in low‐ and middle‐income countries
Cochrane researchers examined the effects of deworming children in areas where intestinal worm infection is common. After searching for relevant trials up to 19 September 2018, we included 50 trials with a total of 84,336 participants, and an additional trial of one million children. 
What is deworming and why might it be important 
Soil‐transmitted worms, including roundworms, hookworms, and whipworms, are common in tropical and subtropical areas, and particularly affect children living in poverty where there is inadequate sanitation. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends that school children in many areas are regularly treated with drugs which kill these worms. Some advocates claim such programmes improve child growth, haemoglobin, cognition, school attendance, school performance, physical fitness, and survival. 
What the research says 
In populations of children living in endemic areas, the effect of the first, single dose of deworming drugs on weight is unclear. There was little or no effect in most studies, except for a large effect detected from one study area in Kenya, reported in two trials carried out over 30 years ago in a school where children were heavily infected with worms. This causes uncertainty, which means we do not know if a first dose or single dose of deworming impacts on weight. For height, most studies showed little or no effect, with the exception of the site in Kenya. A single dose of deworming medicine probably has no effect on haemoglobin and cognition. There is insufficient data to know if there is an effect on school attendance, school performance, or physical fitness or mortality. 
In studies where children were regularly treated with deworming medicine there was little or no effect on weight in all but two trials, irrespective of whether children were heavily infected with worms or not. The two trials with large average weight gains included the Kenya study carried out over 30 years ago, and one study from India carried out over 20 years ago in a low worm burden area where later studies in the same area did not show an effect. In trials from 2000 onwards, which are more relevant given the global reduction in worm burden, there is little or no effect. This causes uncertainty and means we do not know if regularly treating children with deworming medicine improves their weight. Regularly deworming children probably has no effect on height, haemoglobin, cognition, and mortality. We do not know if there is an impact on school attendance, since the evidence is inconsistent and at high risk of bias. There is insufficient data to know if there is an effect on physical fitness. 
Authors' conclusions 
For public health programmes to regularly treat all children in endemic areas with deworming drugs, there is quite substantial evidence of no benefit in terms of haemoglobin, cognition, school performance, and mortality. For weight, contemporary studies do not show an effect, but unusually large effects were seen in studies over 20 years ago.

Oral poisoning is a major cause of mortality and disability worldwide, with estimates of over 100,000 deaths due to unintentional poisoning each year and an overrepresentation of children below five years of age. Any effective intervention that laypeople can apply to limit or delay uptake or to evacuate, dilute or neutralize the poison before professional help arrives may limit toxicity and save lives. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of pre‐hospital interventions (alone or in combination) for treating acute oral poisoning, available to and feasible for laypeople before the arrival of professional help. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ISI Web of Science, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and three clinical trials registries to 4 December 2018, and we also carried out reference checking and citation searching. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials comparing interventions (alone or in combination) that are feasible in a pre‐hospital setting for treating acute oral poisoning patients, including but potentially not limited to activated charcoal (AC), emetics, cathartics, diluents, neutralizing agents and body positioning. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed study selection, data collection and assessment. Primary outcomes of this review were incidence of mortality and adverse events, plus incidence and severity of symptoms of poisoning. Secondary outcomes were duration of symptoms of poisoning, drug absorption, and incidence of hospitalization and ICU admission. 
Main results
We included 24 trials involving 7099 participants. Using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, we assessed no study as being at low risk of bias for all domains. Many studies were poorly reported, so the risk of selection and detection biases were often unclear. Most studies reported important outcomes incompletely, and we judged them to be at high risk of reporting bias. 
All but one study enrolled oral poisoning patients in an emergency department; the remaining study was conducted in a pre‐hospital setting. Fourteen studies included multiple toxic syndromes or did not specify, while the other studies specifically investigated paracetamol (2 studies), carbamazepine (2 studies), tricyclic antidepressant (2 studies), yellow oleander (2 studies), benzodiazepine (1 study), or toxic berry intoxication (1 study). Twenty‐one trials investigated the effects of activated charcoal (AC), administered as a single dose (SDAC) or in multiple doses (MDAC), alone or in combination with other first aid interventions (a cathartic) and/or hospital treatments. Six studies investigated syrup of ipecac plus other first aid interventions (SDAC + cathartic) versus ipecac alone. The collected evidence was mostly of low to very low certainty, often downgraded for indirectness, risk of bias or imprecision due to low numbers of events. 
First aid interventions that limit or delay the absorption of the poison in the body 
We are uncertain about the effect of SDAC compared to no intervention on the incidence of adverse events in general (zero events in both treatment groups; 1 study, 451 participants) or vomiting specifically (Peto odds ratio (OR) 4.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 57.26, 1 study, 25 participants), ICU admission (Peto OR 7.77, 95% CI 0.15 to 391.93, 1 study, 451 participants) and clinical deterioration (zero events in both treatment groups; 1 study, 451 participants) in participants with mixed types or paracetamol poisoning, as all evidence for these outcomes was of very low certainty. No studies assessed SDAC for mortality, duration of symptoms, drug absorption or hospitalization. 
Only one study compared SDAC to syrup of ipecac in participants with mixed types of poisoning, providing very low‐certainty evidence. Therefore we are uncertain about the effects on Glasgow Coma Scale scores (mean difference (MD) −0.15, 95% CI −0.43 to 0.13, 1 study, 34 participants) or incidence of adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 1.24, 95% CI 0.26 to 5.83, 1 study, 34 participants). No information was available concerning mortality, duration of symptoms, drug absorption, hospitalization or ICU admission. 
This review also considered the added value of SDAC or MDAC to hospital interventions, which mostly included gastric lavage. No included studies investigated the use of body positioning in oral poisoning patients. 
First aid interventions that evacuate the poison from the gastrointestinal tract 
We found one study comparing ipecac versus no intervention in toxic berry ingestion in a pre‐hospital setting. Low‐certainty evidence suggests there may be an increase in the incidence of adverse events, but the study did not report incidence of mortality, incidence or duration of symptoms of poisoning, drug absorption, hospitalization or ICU admission (103 participants). 
In addition, we also considered the added value of syrup of ipecac to SDAC plus a cathartic and the added value of a cathartic to SDAC. 
No studies used cathartics as an individual intervention.
First aid interventions that neutralize or dilute the poison 
No included studies investigated the neutralization or dilution of the poison in oral poisoning patients. 
Authors' conclusions
The studies included in this review provided mostly low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence about the use of first aid interventions for acute oral poisoning. A key limitation was the fact that only one included study actually took place in a pre‐hospital setting, which undermines our confidence in the applicability of these results to this setting. Thus, the amount of evidence collected was insufficient to draw any conclusions.

Does First Aid for Swallowing Poison Work Before Help Arrives? A Review of Past Studies

### **Rationale**

**What is the problem?**
Swallowing poison is a serious problem all over the world. It can cause great harm and even death. Young children under five years old are at a high risk of swallowing something harmful by accident.

When someone swallows poison, time is very important. Getting help right away can make a big difference.

**Why did we do this study?**
Researchers wanted to know if there are simple first aid steps that people can take right away. These would be things that anyone could do before an ambulance or a doctor arrives. This kind of first aid could help stop the body from taking in the poison. It could also help get the poison out of the body.

The main goal of this study was to look at past research. We wanted to see if first aid for swallowing poison is safe and if it works. Finding a good first aid method could help save lives and prevent serious harm.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**
This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked for all the past studies they could find on this topic. They looked for a special type of study called a randomized controlled trial. In these studies, people are put into groups by chance to compare different treatments. This is the best way to see if a treatment works.

**Who was in the studies?**
The researchers found 24 past studies to look at. In total, these studies included about 7,100 people. The people in the studies had swallowed different types of harmful things.

**What treatments were studied?**
The studies looked at different first aid treatments. These included:
*   **Activated charcoal:** A black powder that can trap poison inside the stomach so the body does not absorb it.
*   **Syrup of ipecac:** A medicine that makes a person throw up to get the poison out.
*   **Cathartics:** Medicines that speed up bowel movements to help get the poison out of the body faster.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**
After looking at all the past studies, the researchers could not find a clear answer. The proof from these studies was not strong enough to say for sure if first aid helps. Many of the old studies were not done very well, which made it hard to trust the results.

Almost all of the studies took place in a hospital emergency room. Only one study looked at first aid given before the person got to a hospital. This makes it hard to know if the results would be the same for first aid given at home.

**What did the studies show about each treatment?**
*   **Activated Charcoal:** Researchers are not sure if giving activated charcoal helps or causes harm. The studies did not have enough information to show if it stopped people from getting sicker or having bad side effects.
*   **Syrup of Ipecac:** One study looked at giving syrup of ipecac to children who ate poison berries. This study suggested that it might cause more side effects, like throwing up too much. But there was not enough proof to be sure.
*   **Other First Aid:** The studies did not look at other simple first aid. For example, no studies looked at giving water or milk to weaken the poison. No studies looked at placing a person in a special body position to help.

**What did the researchers conclude?**
The researchers who led this review concluded that we do not have enough good proof. We cannot say if first aid for swallowing poison is helpful or safe when used by regular people before help arrives.

Because the proof is so weak, we need more and better research. New studies should be done in real-life settings, like at home or at school, not just in hospitals. This will help us find out the best way for people to help someone who has swallowed poison.","First aid treatments for oral poisoning
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effects of first aid treatments for poisoning that could be feasibly given by people who are not health professionals. 
Background 
Many first aid treatments are recommended for treating people who have ingested poisonous substances. Some treatments, such as activated charcoal (AC), bind to the poison, limiting the body's absorption of it. Others may induce vomiting (such as syrup of ipecac) or dilute or neutralize the poison (such as drinking water, milk or juices). Adjusting the person's body position may also have an effect. 
Study characteristics 
In December 2018 we searched for high‐quality studies (randomly dividing participants into different treatment groups) investigating treatments for poisoning that laypeople can perform. We found 24 studies with 7099 participants. All but one study took place in hospitals; the remaining one was in a home setting. 
Fourteen studies either did not specify the type of poison or studied different kinds. The others investigated overdoses of specific medicines (paracetamol, carbamazepine, antidepressant, benzodiazepine) or poisonous plants (yellow oleander or poisonous berries). 
Twenty‐one trials studied different treatments with activated charcoal: as a single dose or multiple doses, with or without other first aid treatments (a substance to speed up bowel transit), and with or without hospital treatments. Six studies compared syrup of ipecac, with or without other first aid treatments (single‐dose activated charcoal plus bowel transit enhancing substance) versus no treatment. We found no studies that investigated the neutralization or dilution of the poison or the use of certain body positions. 
Key results 
Two studies compared a single dose of activated charcoal to no treatment following poisoning with paracetamol or different kinds of poisoning. We are uncertain about the treatment's side effects, admission to intensive care or worsening of the patient, and there was no information about effects on death, symptom duration, poison uptake or hospitalization. 
One study compared a single dose of activated charcoal to ipecac in mixed types of poisoning. We are uncertain about the effect of activated charcoal compared to ipecac, on the patient's level of coma or the number of unwanted effects. There was no information about effects on death, symptom duration, poison uptake, hospitalization or intensive care admission. 
One study compared ipecac to no treatment in children who ate poisonous berries at home. There may be an increase in the number of unwanted effects for ipecac. There was no information about effects on death, poisoning symptoms, symptoms duration, poison uptake, hospitalization or intensive care admission. 
We also investigated the use of single‐dose or multi‐dose activated charcoal, with or without hospital treatment, compared to each other or no treatment. Furthermore, we investigated the added value of ipecac to single‐dose activated charcoal and the added value of adding bowel transit enhancing substances to AC. 
Certainty of the evidence 
All but one study took place in a hospital setting, which means that the results cannot be directly applied to the lay setting. Because studies did not always report the methods they used, we are uncertain about the quality of the research conduct for many. Outcomes important to patients and pre‐specified by us as important outcomes for this review were often absent or incompletely reported. Our certainty about the results of this review is mostly low to very low. Therefore future research is highly likely to change the findings. 
Conclusion 
Based on the identified evidence, we cannot draw any conclusions about the effects of any of the investigated first aid treatments in a lay setting.

Preterm infants are susceptible to hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia, which may lead to adverse neurodevelopment. The use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices might help in keeping glucose levels in the normal range, and reduce the need for blood sampling. However, the use of CGM might be associated with harms in the preterm infant. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of CGM versus intermittent modalities to measure glycaemia in preterm infants 1. at risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia; 2. with proven hypoglycaemia; or 3. with proven hyperglycaemia. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (2021, Issue 4); PubMed; Embase; and CINAHL in April 2021. We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs and quasi‐RCTs comparing the use of CGM versus intermittent modalities to measure glycaemia in preterm infants at risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia; with proven hypoglycaemia; or with proven hyperglycaemia. 
Data collection and analysis
We assessed the methodological quality of included trials using Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group (EPOC) criteria (assessing randomization, blinding, loss to follow‐up, and handling of outcome data). We evaluated treatment effects using a fixed‐effect model with risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for categorical data and mean, standard deviation (SD), and mean difference (MD) for continuous data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included four trials enrolling 300 infants in our updated review. We included one new study and excluded another previously included study (because the inclusion criteria of the review have been narrowed). We compared the use of CGM to intermittent modalities in preterm infants at risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia; however, one of these trials was analyzed separately because CGM was used as a standalone device, without being coupled to a control algorithm as in the other trials. We identified no studies in preterm infants with proven hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia.  
None of the four included trials reported the neurodevelopmental outcome (i.e. the primary outcome of this review), or seizures. The effect of the use of CGM on mortality during hospitalization is uncertain (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.13; RD −0.02, 95% CI −0.07 to 0.03; 230 participants; 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence). The certainty of the evidence was very low for all outcomes because of limitations in study design, and imprecision of estimates. One study is ongoing (estimated sample size 60 infants) and planned to be completed in 2022. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to determine if CGM affects preterm infant mortality or morbidities.  We are very uncertain of the safety of CGM and the available management algorithms, and many morbidities remain unreported. Preterm infants at risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia were enrolled in all four included studies. No studies have been conducted in preterm infants with proven hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia. Long‐term outcomes were not reported. Events of necrotizing enterocolitis, reported in the study published in 2021, were lower in the CGM group. However, the effect of CGM on this outcome remains very uncertain. Clinical trials are required to determine the most effective CGM and glycaemic management regimens in preterm infants before larger studies can be performed to assess the efficacy of CGM for reducing mortality, morbidity, and long‐term neurodevelopmental impairments.

### **Plain Title**

Is a 24/7 Blood Sugar Monitor Safe and Helpful for Babies Born Too Early?

### **Rationale**

Babies who are born too early are very small. Their bodies are not fully ready for life outside the womb. Because of this, they can have problems keeping their blood sugar at a safe level.

Blood sugar is the sugar in our blood that gives us energy. If a baby’s blood sugar is too high or too low, it can be dangerous. It may harm the baby’s brain as it grows and develops.

Doctors usually check a baby’s blood sugar by pricking their heel to get a drop of blood. This is done from time to time. This method can be painful for the baby. It also only shows the blood sugar level at that one moment.

A new device called a continuous glucose monitor, or CGM, can help. A CGM is a small sensor placed on the skin. It checks blood sugar all the time, day and night. This may help doctors keep the baby’s blood sugar in a safe range.

Researchers wanted to know if using a CGM is better than the usual heel pricks. They wanted to see if it helps babies born too early. They also wanted to know if it is safe. This study looked at all the research that has been done so far to find an answer.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with patients. Instead, the researchers looked for all the best studies that had already been completed. This is called a review.

The researchers looked for studies that compared two groups of babies. One group used a CGM to check blood sugar. The other group had the usual heel pricks.

The studies in this review included 300 babies in total. All the babies were born too early. They were at risk for having blood sugar levels that were too high or too low.

### **Results**

The researchers found four studies that fit their search. After looking at all the results together, they found that there is not enough information to make a decision.

The main question was whether using a CGM helps a baby’s brain grow and develop better in the long run. None of the studies looked at this. The studies also did not report if the CGM helped prevent seizures.

The researchers looked at other health problems, too. They checked to see if using a CGM changed the number of babies who died. The results showed no clear difference between the groups. The researchers are very unsure about this result.

One study found that fewer babies in the CGM group got a serious gut problem. But again, the researchers are very uncertain about this finding. The studies were small, and the way they were done makes it hard to be sure of the results.

The authors of this review concluded that we do not have enough proof to say if CGMs help or harm these tiny babies. We need more and better studies. Future studies should be larger. They need to follow babies for a long time to see how their brains develop. Until then, we cannot be sure what is the best way to check blood sugar in babies born too early.","Devices to continuously monitor sugar (glucose) levels in the blood in newborns born preterm 
Review questions 
What are the benefits and harms of the use of subcutaneous (under the skin) sensors for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) with or without an algorithm (a set of mathematical rules) to correct too high or too low ​​​​​ levels of blood glucose versus intermittent modalities to measure blood glucose with or without an algorithm to guide the correction of too high or too low blood glucose in preterm infants 1. at risk of too high or too low ​​​​​​ levels of blood glucose; 2. with proven too low ​​​​​​levels of blood glucose; and 3. with proven too high​​​​​​ levels of blood glucose? 
Background 
Newborns born too early ('preterm') are susceptible to levels of blood glucose that are too high or too low. Most preterm babies with these abnormal concentrations  have a full recovery, or only mild problems. For some preterm babies with extremely high or low (or more prolonged) blood glucose, this may lead to death or to problems later in life. 
The aim of this updated review was to assess whether the use of CGM could improve the long‐term development or reduce deaths in preterm newborns. CGM devices are inserted subcutaneously, and provide data on blood glucose in real time. The standard method of measuring blood glucose consists of measuring blood glucose concentrations intermittently by  withdrawing small amounts of blood, often by heel pricks.  
Study characteristicsWe collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer the review question, and found four studies enrolling 300 babies. These studies compared the use of CGM to intermittent measurements in infants at risk of too high or too low ​​​​​​ levels of blood glucose. 
Key results 
None of the four included studies reported on the long‐term neurodevelopmental outcome of preterm infants. The studies were too small to determine if CGM has an effect on survival. One study is ongoing. Although one study published in 2021 reported the incidence of serious intestinal injury (necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious inflammation of the intestines that can be life threatening) was lower in the CGM group, this finding is very uncertain because the results were very imprecise.  Further research is needed. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was very low due to the overall limited number of studies, with few babies enrolled. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We searched for studies that were available up to 1 April 2021.

Each year, in high‐income countries alone, approximately 100 million people develop scars. Excessive scarring can cause pruritus, pain, contractures, and cosmetic disfigurement, and can dramatically affect people's quality of life, both physically and psychologically. Hypertrophic scars are visible and elevated scars that do not spread into surrounding tissues and that often regress spontaneously. Silicone gel sheeting (SGS) is made from medical‐grade silicone reinforced with a silicone membrane backing and is one of the most commonly used treatments for hypertrophic scars. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of silicone gel sheeting for the treatment of hypertrophic scars in any care setting. 
Search methods
In April 2021 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled people with any hypertrophic scars and assessed the use of SGS. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment, data extraction and GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence. We resolved initial disagreements by discussion, or by consulting a third review author when necessary. 
Main results
Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Study sample sizes ranged from 10 to 60 participants. The trials were clinically heterogeneous with differences in duration of follow‐up, and scar site. We report 10 comparisons, SGS compared with no SGS treatment and SGS compared with the following treatments: pressure garments; silicone gel; topical onion extract; polyurethane; propylene glycol and hydroxyethyl cellulose sheeting; Kenalog injection; flashlamp‐pumped pulsed‐dye laser; intense pulsed light  and Gecko Nanoplast (a silicone gel bandage). Six trials had a split‐site design and three trials had an unclear design (resulting in a mix of paired and clustered data). 
Included studies reported limited outcome data for the primary review outcomes of severity of scarring measured by health professionals and adverse events (limited data reported by some included studies, but further analyses of these data was not possible) and no data were reported for severity of scarring reported by patients. For secondary outcomes some pain data were reported, but health‐related quality of life and cost effectiveness were not reported. Many trials had poorly‐reported methodology, meaning the risk of bias was unclear. We rated all evidence as being either of low or very low certainty, often because of imprecision resulting from few participants, low event rates, or both, all in single studies. 
SGS compared with no SGS 
Seven studies with 177 participants compared SGS with no SGS for hypertrophic scars. Two studies with 31 participants (32 scars) reported severity of scarring assessed by health professionals, and it is uncertain whether there is a difference in severity of scarring between the two groups (mean difference (MD) ‐1.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3.77 to 0.12; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, and twice for serious imprecision). One study with 34 participants suggests SGS may result in a slight reduction in pain level compared with no SGS treatment (MD −1.26, 95% CI −2.26 to −0.26; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). 
SGS compared with pressure garments 
One study with 54 participants was included in this comparison. The study reported that SGS may reduce pain levels compared with pressure garments (MD −1.90, 95% CI −2.99 to −0.81;  low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). 
SGS compared with silicone gel 
One study with 32 participants was included in this comparison. It is unclear if SGS impacts on severity of scarring assessed by health professionals compared with silicone gel (MD 0.40, 95% CI −0.88 to 1.68; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, twice for imprecision). 
SGS compared with topical onion extract 
One trial (32 participants) was included in this comparison. SGS may slightly reduce severity of scarring compared with topical onion extract (MD ‐1.30, 95% CI ‐2.58 to ‐0.02; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, and once for imprecision). 
SGS compared with polyurethane 
One study with 60 participants was included in this comparison. It is unclear if SGS impacts on the severity of scarring assessed by health professionals compared with polyurethane (MD 0.50, 95% CI ‐2.96 to 3.96; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, and twice for imprecision). 
SGS compared with self‐adhesive propylene glycol and hydroxyethyl cellulose sheeting 
One study with 38 participants was included in this comparison. It is uncertain if SGS reduces pain compared with self‐adhesive propylene glycol and hydroxyethyl cellulose sheeting (MD −0.12, 95% CI −0.18 to −0.06). This is very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, once for imprecision and once for indirectness. 
SGS compared with Gecko Nanoplast 
One study with 60 participants was included in this comparison. It is unclear if SGS impacts on pain compared with Gecko Nanoplast (MD 0.70, 95% CI  ‐0.28 to 1.68; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision. 
There was a lack of reportable data from the other three comparisons of SGS with Kenalog injection, flashlamp‐pumped pulsed‐dye laser or intense pulsed light. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently limited rigorous RCT evidence available about the clinical effectiveness of SGS in the treatment of hypertrophic scars. None of the included studies provided evidence on severity of scarring validated by participants, health‐related quality of life, or cost effectiveness. Reporting was poor, to the extent that we are not confident that most trials are free from risk of bias. The limitations in current RCT evidence suggest that further trials are required to reduce uncertainty around decision‐making in the use of SGS to treat hypertrophic scars.

Can Silicone Sheets Help Heal Raised Scars?

### **Rationale**

Many people get scars. Each year, about 100 million people in wealthy countries get a scar. Some scars can be thick and raised. Doctors call these ""hypertrophic"" (hy-per-TRO-fik) scars.

These raised scars can cause problems. They can be itchy and painful. They can make the skin feel tight, which makes it hard to move. Scars can also make people feel bad about how they look. This can affect a person's life in many ways.

One common treatment for raised scars is silicone gel sheets. These are like sticky bandages made from a soft, rubbery material called silicone. People wear them on their scars.

Researchers wanted to know if these silicone sheets really work. They looked at past studies to see what the proof was. This study aimed to combine all the results from past research to get a clear answer on how well silicone sheets treat raised scars.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers searched for all the studies that had already been done on this topic.

They looked for a special type of study. In these studies, people with raised scars were put into different groups by chance. One group used silicone sheets. The other groups used a different treatment or no treatment at all. This is the best way to fairly compare treatments.

The researchers found 13 of these studies to look at. The studies were all quite small. They had between 10 and 60 people in them. The people in the studies were men and women of all ages who had raised scars.

The studies compared silicone sheets to many other treatments. These included:
*   No treatment
*   Special tight clothing called pressure garments
*   Other gels and creams
*   Injections of medicine
*   Laser treatments

How long people were in each study was different from study to study.

### **Results**

The researchers found that there is not enough good proof to know for sure if silicone sheets work well. Most of the studies they looked at were small. Some were not well designed. This means the researchers were not very sure about the results. They called the proof ""low"" or ""very low"" quality.

Here is what the studies found when comparing silicone sheets to other treatments:

*   **Silicone sheets compared to no treatment:** It was not clear if silicone sheets made scars look better. They may have helped reduce pain a little bit.
*   **Silicone sheets compared to special tight clothing:** The sheets may have been better at reducing pain.
*   **Silicone sheets compared to a cream made from onion:** The sheets may have made scars look a little bit better.
*   **Silicone sheets compared to other treatments:** For most other treatments, like other types of gels or bandages, it was unclear if silicone sheets were better, worse, or the same.

The researchers also found that a lot of important information was missing from the studies. None of the studies asked patients if they thought their scars looked better. The studies did not report on people's overall well-being or quality of life. They also did not look at whether the treatment was a good value for the money.

In the end, the researchers concluded that we cannot be sure if silicone sheets are a good treatment for raised scars. Because the past studies were small and had some weaknesses, we need new, bigger, and better studies. This will help doctors and patients make better decisions about treating raised scars in the future.","Silicone gel sheeting for treating hypertrophic scars
Background 
A scar is a mark left on the skin after a wound or injury has healed, for example, after surgery or after a burn. Most scars will fade and become paler over time, but some scars may become red and raised (called hypertrophic scars). Hypertrophic scars may take several years to flatten and fade. 
Scars can be itchy, painful or unsightly, and may restrict movement. Scarring can affect people physically and emotionally, and can affect a person's well‐being. 
Treatments aim to improve a scar’s appearance and help to make it less visible. They include: wearing clothing that fits tightly around the skin (pressure garments); treatments applied to the scar; laser therapy and silicone gel sheets. 
Silicone gel sheets are soft wound dressings containing an elastic form of silicone. They have a soft, rubbery texture and stick to the skin. They are commonly used on healing skin to help soften and flatten a hypertrophic scar. 
What did we want to find out? 
In this Cochrane Review, we wanted to find out how well silicone gel sheets worked in treating hypertrophic scars. 
Our methods 
We searched for studies that investigated the use of silicone gel sheets to treat hypertrophic scars. We searched for randomised controlled trials only, in which the treatment each person receives is chosen at random. These studies give the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. 
What we found 
We found 13 studies with 468 people (425 of them completed the study) with hypertrophic scars caused by surgery, injury, burns or scalding. The studies compared the effects of silicone gel sheets with: giving no treatment with silicone gel sheets; wearing pressure garments; applying silicone gel or onion extract; polyurethane dressings; steroid injections;  laser therapy; intense pulsed light or Gecko Nanoplast (a silicone gel bandage). 
All studies were conducted in hospitals, in Europe (6 studies), China (2), the USA (1), Canada (1), Iran (1), Turkey (1) and India (1). They lasted for different lengths of time: from 3 months to 12 months. 
Four studies reported assessments of scars by healthcare professionals in way that was usable for this review. No studies reported useful results for the person's own assessment of their scar after treatment. 
No studies reported useful results for people's well‐being (quality of life): for whether people stayed on the treatment (adherence), whether the treatments had any unwanted effects; or whether the treatments were cost‐effective (the benefits of treatment outweighed any extra costs). 
The studies did not give enough information to compare silicone gel sheets with steroid injections, laser therapy or pulsed light. 
What are the main results of our review? 
Silicone gel sheets may slightly improve the appearance of hypertrophic scars compared with onion extract.  We are uncertain whether silicone gel sheets improve a scar's appearance better than no treatment with silicone gel sheets, or silicone gel, or polyurethane.  
Silicone gel sheets may reduce pain levels compared with pressure garments. Silicone gel sheets may also result in a slight reduction in pain levels compared with no treatment with silicone gel sheets. We are uncertain whether silicone gel sheets decrease pain compared with self‐adhesive propylene glycol and hydroxyethyl cellulose sheeting.  The evidence is also very uncertain about the effect of silicone gel sheets on pain compared with Gecko Nanoplast. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Our certainty (confidence) in the evidence was low, or very low. The evidence we found comes from a few studies (sometimes only one), often in small numbers of people, with poorly reported results, so we are not sure how reliable the results are. We therefore think our conclusions would be likely to change if results from further studies become available. 
Conclusions 
We are uncertain about whether silicone gel sheets work better than most other treatments for hypertrophic scars. Silicone gel sheets may improve the appearance of scars slightly compared with applying onion extract, and may reduce pain compared with no treatment with silicone gel sheets or pressure garments.

Review question 
Should oxygen be used for people with lung scarring conditions, known as interstitial lung disease (ILD), whose oxygen levels drop when they exercise? 
Background 
Many people with ILD have a drop in their oxygen levels when they are moving about. This is because of their lung scarring. Oxygen can be given, to be used only when people are moving about, to prevent this drop. This is called ambulatory oxygen. This may help to improve symptoms of breathlessness and their ability to exercise. It may also improve their quality of life. This Cochrane review examined the evidence for any effect of ambulatory oxygen on the ability to exercise, breathlessness and quality of life. Cochrane researchers searched the available evidence up to 4th May 2016. 
Study characteristics and key results 
We included only three studies, which had a total of 98 participants with ILD. All three studies compared the effects of both oxygen and air in all participants while they did an exercise test, while preventing them from knowing which treatment they were being given. Two studies showed no helpful effects on the ability to exercise or on symptoms of breathlessness. One study showed that participants could exercise for longer with oxygen. None of these studies looked at the effect of oxygen on quality of life, survival, the cost of oxygen treatment or its effects on hospital admissions. No adverse events were reported in any of the studies. 
We also looked for studies of oxygen given after exercise in people with ILD (""short burst oxygen""), but did not find any studies. 
Quality of the evidence 
There were some problems with the way these studies were conducted. The included studies were small. Also, two studies did not make sure that the amount of oxygen given was enough to prevent a drop in oxygen levels when the participants were exercising. This could mean that they were not given enough oxygen. The overall quality of evidence in this review was low. 
Conclusions 
We cannot tell from these studies if ambulatory oxygen is helpful in people with ILD. More research is needed, which should look at the effect of ambulatory oxygen on exercise, breathlessness and also on quality of life in people with ILD.

### **Plain Title**

Does Using Oxygen During Activities Help People with Scarred Lungs?

### **Rationale**

Some people have a condition that causes scars on their lungs. This is called interstitial lung disease, or ILD. These scars can make it very hard for the lungs to work well.

When a person with lung scars moves or exercises, their body may not get enough oxygen. This can make them feel very short of breath. It can make it hard to do daily tasks like walking or cleaning.

Doctors can give people oxygen to breathe from a small tank while they are active. The hope is that this extra oxygen will help people feel less breathless. It might help them be more active and improve their daily life. We wanted to look at past studies to see if using oxygen this way really helps.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with patients. Instead, our team looked at all the research that had already been done. This type of study is called a review. We searched for all studies on this topic up to May 2016.

We found three studies to include in our review. In total, these studies had 98 people with lung scars. In each study, every person tried two different things during an exercise test.

First, they did the test while breathing extra oxygen. Then, they did the same test while breathing normal air. The people in the studies did not know if they were getting oxygen or normal air. This helped make the results fair.

### **Results**

The results from the three studies were not clear. We cannot say for sure if using oxygen during activity is helpful.

Two of the three studies found that oxygen did not help. People did not feel less breathless. They were not able to exercise any longer. One study did find that people could exercise for a bit longer when they used oxygen.

None of the studies looked at how oxygen might affect a person's quality of life. They also did not look at the cost of treatment or if it kept people out of the hospital. The good news was that no bad side effects from using oxygen were reported in any of the studies.

There were some problems with the studies we reviewed. They were all very small. Two of the studies may not have given people enough oxygen for it to work. Because of these problems, we have low confidence in the results.

Based on this review, we still do not know if using oxygen during activity helps people with lung scars. More and better research is needed to find a clear answer. Future studies should be larger and make sure they test the right amount of oxygen.","Use of oxygen during activities for people with lung scarring conditions

Review question: Does antithrombin reduce the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (i.e. bleeding in the brain) and mortality in very preterm infants? 
Background: Antithrombin is a drug that modulates blood coagulation together with other factors. Very low birth weight newborn infants (i.e. those neonates with a gestational age less than 32 weeks) have low level of antithrombin in the blood. On the basis of an observational study in very preterm infants, it has been suggested that the administration of drugs that prevent clotting (anticoagulants) such as antithrombin may reduce the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage and progression of intraventricular hemorrhage, a frequent complication of preterm neonates. This systematic review synthesizes the available evidence on the effectiveness of antithrombin in preventing intraventricular hemorrhage in very preterm neonates. 
Study characteristics: We included two trials for a total of 182 newborn infants comparing antithrombin with placebo (sugar or albumin solution). 
Results: The use of antithrombin does not reduce the risks of bleeding in the brain, mortality or any other relevant outcomes in very preterm neonates when compared to placebo. However, the data collected are too limited to draw definitive conclusions on the use of antithrombin in the prevention of intraventricular hemorrhage (i.e. bleeding in the brain).

### **Plain Title**

Does a Drug Help Stop Brain Bleeds in Very Early Babies?

### **Rationale**

**What is the health problem?**

Babies who are born very early are very small and their bodies are not fully formed. This means they can have serious health problems. One of these problems is bleeding inside the brain. This is a big concern for these tiny babies and their families.

**Why did doctors do this study?**

Our bodies have a natural substance called antithrombin. It helps control how our blood clots, so we do not bleed or clot too much. Babies born very early have low levels of this substance.

Doctors thought that low antithrombin might be linked to brain bleeds. They wanted to know if giving these babies more antithrombin could help. The main question was: Does giving this drug to very early babies stop brain bleeds?

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked for all the good studies that had already been done on this topic. This is called a review. It helps to bring all the information together to get a clearer answer.

The researchers found two past studies to review. In total, these studies looked at 182 babies. All the babies in the studies were born very early.

In those studies, some babies were given the real drug, antithrombin. Other babies were given a placebo. A placebo is a pretend medicine, like sugar water. Using a placebo helps doctors see if the real drug works better than no treatment at all.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

Researchers looked at the results from the 182 babies in the two studies. They wanted to see if the babies who got antithrombin had fewer brain bleeds. They also checked if it helped them survive.

The review showed that the drug did not seem to lower the risk of brain bleeds. It also did not lower the risk of death for these babies. The drug did not show other clear benefits.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

The researchers concluded that there was not enough information to be sure. The two studies they looked at were very small. With so few babies, it is hard to get a strong answer.

This means we still do not know if antithrombin helps or harms very early babies. The results from this review could mean either one. Because of this, more and larger studies are needed to find a clear answer for doctors and families.","The use of the anticoagulant antithrombin to reduce the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (i.e. bleeding in the brain) in very preterm infants

10.1002-14651858.CD013424.pub2,"Background
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent risk factor for osteoporosis and is more prevalent among people with CKD than among people who do not have CKD. Although several drugs have been used to effectively treat osteoporosis in the general population, it is unclear whether they are also effective and safe for people with CKD, who have altered systemic mineral and bone metabolism. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions for osteoporosis in patients with CKD stages 3‐5, and those undergoing dialysis (5D). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 25 January 2021 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing any anti‐osteoporotic drugs with a placebo, no treatment or usual care in patients with osteoporosis and CKD stages 3 to 5D were included. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed their quality using the risk of bias tool, and extracted data. The main outcomes were the incidence of fracture at any sites; mean change in the bone mineral density (BMD; measured using dual‐energy radiographic absorptiometry (DXA)) of the femoral neck, total hip, lumbar spine, and distal radius; death from all causes; incidence of adverse events; and quality of life (QoL). Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. 
Main results
Seven studies involving 9164 randomised participants with osteoporosis and CKD stages 3 to 5D met the inclusion criteria; all participants were postmenopausal women. Five studies included patients with CKD stages 3‐4, and two studies included patients with CKD stages 5 or 5D. Five pharmacological interventions were identified (abaloparatide, alendronate, denosumab, raloxifene, and teriparatide). All studies were judged to be at an overall high risk of bias. 
Among patients with CKD stages 3‐4, anti‐osteoporotic drugs may reduce the risk of vertebral fracture (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.69; low certainty evidence). Anti‐osteoporotic drugs probably makes little or no difference to the risk of clinical fracture (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.05; moderate certainty evidence) and adverse events (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00; moderate certainty evidence). We were unable to incorporate studies into the meta‐analyses for BMD at the femoral neck, lumbar spine and total hip as they only reported the percentage change in the BMD in the intervention group. 
Among patients with severe CKD stages 5 or 5D, it is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug reduces the risk of clinical fracture (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.87; very low certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug improves the BMD at the femoral neck because the certainty of this evidence is very low (MD 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.02). Anti‐osteoporotic drug may slightly improve the BMD at the lumbar spine (MD 0.03, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.04, low certainty evidence). No adverse events were reported in the included studies. It is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug reduces the risk of death (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.22 to 4.56; very low certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Among patients with CKD stages 3‐4, anti‐osteoporotic drugs may reduce the risk of vertebral fracture in low certainty evidence. Anti‐osteoporotic drugs make little or no difference to the risk of clinical fracture and adverse events in moderate certainty evidence. Among patients with CKD stages 5 and 5D, it is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug reduces the risk of clinical fracture and death because the certainty of this evidence is very low. Anti‐osteoporotic drug may slightly improve the BMD at the lumbar spine in low certainty evidence. It is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug improves the BMD at the femoral neck because the certainty of this evidence is very low. Larger studies including men, paediatric patients or individuals with unstable CKD‐mineral and bone disorder are required to assess the effect of each anti‐osteoporotic drug at each stage of CKD.

Do Medicines for Weak Bones Work for People with Kidney Disease?

**Rationale**
Chronic kidney disease, or CKD, is a condition where your kidneys do not work well over a long time. People with CKD are more likely to get another condition called osteoporosis. Osteoporosis makes your bones weak and more likely to break.

There are good medicines that help make bones stronger for most people. But we do not know if these medicines are safe and helpful for people with CKD. This is because kidney disease changes how the body handles minerals that are important for strong bones.

The goal of this study was to look at past research to see if medicines for weak bones are safe and can help prevent broken bones in people with kidney disease.

**Trial Design**
This was not a new study with its own patients. Instead, researchers looked for and combined the results from past studies. This helps to get a stronger answer than one study can give on its own.

They looked for the best type of studies, where people were put into groups by chance. One group would get a real medicine for weak bones. The other group would get a fake medicine, called a placebo, or no treatment at all.

The researchers found 7 studies with a total of 9,164 people. All of the people in these studies were women who had gone through menopause. They all had weak bones and kidney disease. Some people had mild to moderate kidney disease. Others had severe kidney disease or were on dialysis, a treatment that helps clean the blood when kidneys fail.

**Results**
The researchers looked at the results for two groups of people separately.

**For People with Mild to Moderate Kidney Disease:**
*   The medicines may have helped lower the number of broken bones in the spine. But the researchers were not very sure about this finding.
*   For other types of broken bones, the medicines seemed to make little or no difference. The researchers were more sure about this.
*   The medicines also did not seem to cause more side effects or health problems than the fake medicine. The researchers were also more sure about this result.

**For People with Severe Kidney Disease or on Dialysis:**
*   It was not clear if the medicines helped prevent broken bones. The researchers were very unsure about the results for this group.
*   The medicines may have slightly improved bone strength in the lower back. But it was not clear if they helped improve bone strength in the hip. Again, the researchers were not very sure about these results.
*   It was also unclear if the medicines affected the risk of death. The studies did not report on any side effects for this group.

**What this means:**
The researchers concluded that for people with mild to moderate kidney disease, medicines for weak bones might help prevent broken bones in the spine. For people with severe kidney disease, it is still very uncertain if these medicines help.

More and better studies are needed. We need bigger studies to be sure about these results. We also need studies that include men and other groups of people with kidney disease to know if these medicines can help them.","Pharmacological treatments for osteoporosis in patients with chronic kidney disease
What is the issue?Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of osteoporosis (weakened bone strength), which can often lead to bone fracture. Several drugs are available for the treatment of osteoporosis; however, it is unknown whether these drugs are equally effective and safe in patients with CKD because bone strength impairment in these patients occurs via a different mechanism. 
What did we do?Data were collected from studies including patients with osteoporosis and CKD stages 3‐5, and those undergoing dialysis (stage 5D) with data available on fracture, change in the bone mineral density (BMD; a bone strength index), and adverse events. We included seven studies with available evidence up to 25 January 2021, comparing anti‐osteoporotic drugs (abaloparatide, alendronate, denosumab, raloxifene, and teriparatide) with placebo (a dummy drug), in 9,164 postmenopausal women. We performed a meta‐analysis to assess the effects of these anti‐osteoporotic drugs. 
What did we find?In postmenopausal women with CKD stages 3‐4, anti‐osteoporotic drugs may reduce vertebral fracture in low certainty evidence. Anti‐osteoporotic drugs probably make little or no difference to clinical fracture and adverse events in moderate certainty evidence. In postmenopausal with CKD stages 5 or 5D, it is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug reduces the risk of clinical fracture and death, and anti‐osteoporotic drug may slightly improve BMD at the lumbar spine in low certainty evidence. It is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug improve BMD at the femoral neck. 
ConclusionsAmong postmenopausal women with CKD stages 3‐4, anti‐osteoporotic drugs may reduce the risk of vertebral fracture. Among patients with CKD stages 5 and 5D, anti‐osteoporotic drug may slightly improve bone strength. However, these conclusions are based on limited data and therefore uncertain.

10.1002-14651858.CD011749.pub2,"Medicines to treat delirium in critically ill adult patients
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence from randomized controlled trials for the benefits and safety of all prescription medicines used to treat critically ill adult patients with delirium in the intensive care units (ICUs) of hospitals. 
Background 
Delirium is commonly associated with surgery, infection, or critical illness. It is experienced as new‐onset, generally short‐term inability to think clearly. Patients with delirium shift between periods of clear thinking and periods of agitation and/or great sleepiness and confusion. Lack of sleep, pain, a noisy environment, physical restraint, and the use of sedatives and strong analgesics are some of the contributing factors. Delirium affects both immediate and longer‐term health outcomes of critically ill patients as it can increase the length of time a breathing machine is required, time spent in the ICU and in hospital, and the chance of functional weakening and death. The odds of a poor outcome with delirium are increased with frail patients and those of advanced age and already present cognitive difficulties. Frequently, delirious ICU patients are given medicines to help treat symptoms such as agitation. 
Study characteristics 
This review is current to 21 March 2019. We found 14 randomized controlled studies that enrolled a total of 1844 adult participants. Six different classes of medicines were tested. These were antipsychotic drugs used as tranquillizers in ten studies; the sedative alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine in three studies; statins that reduce cholesterol in two studies; opioids as part of pain management in one study; serotonin antagonists for nausea and vomiting in one study; and cholinesterase inhibitors, which are medicines for Alzheimer's disease, in one study. Ten studies compared medicine to placebo ‐ an inactive medicine also known as a sugar pill; four studies compared different drugs. Eleven studies with 1153 participants reported on the main outcome of this review ‐ duration of delirium. 
Key findings 
When drug classes were directly compared with placebo, only the alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine was found to reduce the duration of delirium, and the cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine was found to prolong the duration of delirium. Each of these results is based on findings from a single small study. The other drugs when compared to placebo did not change delirium duration. The Review authors used the statistical method of network meta‐analysis to compare the six different drug classes. Dexmedetomidine was ranked most effective in reducing delirium duration, followed by atypical antipsychotics. However, network meta‐analysis of delirium duration failed to rule out the possibility of no difference for all six drug classes compared to placebo. Using this method, we did not find that any drug improved the duration of coma, length of stay, long‐term cognitive outcomes, or death. The alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine shortened time spent on a breathing machine. Adverse events often were not reported in these trials or were rare when reported. An analysis of reported events showed that events were similar to those reported with placebo. We found 10 ongoing studies and six studies awaiting classification that, once published and assessed, may change the conclusions of this review. 
Quality of the evidence 
Most of the included studies were small but of good design. Nine of the 14 studies were considered to have low risk of bias.

Medicines for Sudden Confusion in Very Sick Adults

### Rationale

**What is sudden confusion and why is it a problem?**

When people are very sick in the hospital, they can sometimes get a condition called delirium. This is a state of sudden confusion. It can make it hard to think clearly.

A person with delirium might be very restless and upset. Or they might be very sleepy and confused. This can be scary for the person and their family. Delirium can also cause serious problems. It can mean a longer stay in the hospital. It can also increase the time a person needs a breathing machine.

**Why did we do this study?**

Doctors often give medicines to treat the symptoms of delirium, like being upset. But we are not sure if these medicines really help people get better faster.

Researchers wanted to look at past studies on this topic. They wanted to find out which medicines work best to treat delirium in very sick adults. They also wanted to know if these medicines are safe.

### Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of past studies to bring all the information together. This is called a review.

The researchers looked at 14 different studies. These studies included about 1800 adults. All the people in these studies were very sick in a part of the hospital called the Intensive Care Unit, or ICU. The ICU is for people who need special medical care.

In the studies, patients were chosen by chance to get a real medicine or a fake medicine. The fake medicine is called a placebo, or a sugar pill. This is the best way to see if a real medicine works. The researchers looked at six different types of medicine that were tested in these studies.

### Results

**What were the main results of the study?**

The review found that most of the medicines did not shorten the time a person was confused.

One medicine, a sedative called dexmedetomidine, seemed to help. It made the confusion go away sooner. However, this result came from only one small study. This medicine also helped people get off a breathing machine faster.

Another medicine, which is used to treat Alzheimer's disease, seemed to make the confusion last longer.

The researchers used a special method to compare all six types of medicine. They found that dexmedetomidine was likely the best at shortening the time of confusion. But they could not be sure that any of the drugs were better than a sugar pill.

**What else did the study find?**

The medicines did not seem to help with other problems. They did not help people leave the hospital sooner. They did not help improve a person’s thinking in the long term. They also did not lower the chance of dying.

The studies did not report many side effects, or bad reactions, from the medicines. The side effects that were reported were similar to those seen in people who took the sugar pill.

**What do these results mean?**

Right now, there is not strong proof that most medicines help treat delirium. More and better research is needed. There are many new studies being done. When those studies are finished, we may have a better answer.","Medicines to treat delirium in critically ill adult patients

Lack of sleep, pain, a noisy environment, physical restraint, and the use of sedatives and strong analgesics are some of the contributing factors. Delirium affects both immediate and longer‐term health outcomes of critically ill patients as it can increase the length of time a breathing machine is required, time spent in the ICU and in hospital, and the chance of functional weakening and death. The odds of a poor outcome with delirium are increased with frail patients and those of advanced age and already present cognitive difficulties. Frequently, delirious ICU patients are given medicines to help treat symptoms such as agitation. 
Study characteristics 
This review is current to 21 March 2019. We found 14 randomized controlled studies that enrolled a total of 1844 adult participants. Six different classes of medicines were tested. These were antipsychotic drugs used as tranquillizers in ten studies; the sedative alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine in three studies; statins that reduce cholesterol in two studies; opioids as part of pain management in one study; serotonin antagonists for nausea and vomiting in one study; and cholinesterase inhibitors, which are medicines for Alzheimer's disease, in one study. Ten studies compared medicine to placebo ‐ an inactive medicine also known as a sugar pill; four studies compared different drugs. Eleven studies with 1153 participants reported on the main outcome of this review ‐ duration of delirium. 
Key findings 
When drug classes were directly compared with placebo, only the alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine was found to reduce the duration of delirium, and the cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine was found to prolong the duration of delirium. Each of these results is based on findings from a single small study. The other drugs when compared to placebo did not change delirium duration. The Review authors used the statistical method of network meta‐analysis to compare the six different drug classes. Dexmedetomidine was ranked most effective in reducing delirium duration, followed by atypical antipsychotics. However, network meta‐analysis of delirium duration failed to rule out the possibility of no difference for all six drug classes compared to placebo. Using this method, we did not find that any drug improved the duration of coma, length of stay, long‐term cognitive outcomes, or death. The alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine shortened time spent on a breathing machine. Adverse events often were not reported in these trials or were rare when reported. An analysis of reported events showed that events were similar to those reported with placebo. We found 10 ongoing studies and six studies awaiting classification that, once published and assessed, may change the conclusions of this review. 
Quality of the evidence 
Most of the included studies were small but of good design. Nine of the 14 studies were considered to have low risk of bias.

Refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons are involuntary migrants, who have often experienced distress when forced to leave their home, on the journey, and in the process of settling in a host country or new environment. Mental health promotion, prevention, and treatments for mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and post‐traumatic stress disorder may work differently in these groups of people than for the general population. This overview of systematic reviews summarises the characteristics of reviews available on this topic, to help us determine which research questions are the most important to address in future Cochrane reviews. 
We searched for systematic reviews and protocols of systematic reviews on mental health promotion, prevention, and treatment of mental health problems for refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons. Mental health promotion may, for example, involve a classroom‐based well‐being intervention for children. An example of prevention is trauma‐focused therapy to prevent post‐traumatic stress disorder. Treatment may, for example, include psychological therapy for depression. We found 23 systematic reviews and 15 protocols of reviews in progress. Together the 23 published systematic reviews included 336 references, 175 of which were unique studies. Reviews more commonly included refugees and asylum seekers than internally displaced persons, and were more frequently focused on adults than children. There was more attention on the treatment of post‐traumatic stress disorder than there was for mental health promotion or prevention, or for the treatment of depression or anxiety. Studies of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Narrative Exposure Therapy, and integrative and interpersonal therapies were most likely to be included in reviews. 
The quality of reviews was limited by a range of issues, many of which related to poor reporting of the review methodology. 
The evidence available from systematic reviews may not match the need for evidence‐based interventions for the mental health of involuntary migrants. Review authors should consider relevant groups such as internally displaced persons, children, and people with depression or anxiety, and relevant interventions such as those for mental health promotion or prevention, and treatments other than psychological therapy.

A Look at Past Research on Mental Health Support for People Forced to Leave Their Homes

**Rationale**

Some people are forced to leave their homes because of danger, such as war or disaster. These people may be called refugees or asylum seekers. They have often been through very hard and stressful things. These bad experiences can happen when they leave their home, during their journey, or when they try to start a new life in a new place.

These experiences can affect a person’s mental health. Mental health is about how you feel and think. Some people may feel very sad, worried, or stressed for a long time. They may have a condition like depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a condition that can happen after seeing or living through a very scary event. It can cause bad dreams or make you feel like the event is happening again.

The ways we help people with these mental health problems may need to be different for those who were forced to leave their homes. Researchers wanted to find out what we already know about this. They decided to look at all the research that has already been done. This study was needed to see what types of help have been studied, who has been included in the research, and where there are gaps in our knowledge. By finding these gaps, future studies can focus on the most important questions to help find the best support for these groups.

**Trial Design**

This was not a study with new patients. Instead, the researchers did a “study of studies.” They looked for all the big summary studies that were already published on this topic. A summary study, also called a systematic review, gathers all the research on one topic to see what it all says together. This gives a bigger picture of what we know.

The researchers searched for summary studies about mental health help for people forced to leave their homes. They looked for studies that included adults and children who were refugees, asylum seekers, or had to move inside their own country.

The researchers looked for three different kinds of mental health help in the studies:

*   **Mental health promotion:** This means helping people stay well. An example is a class in school to help children with their well-being.
*   **Prevention:** This means stopping mental health problems before they start. An example is a special kind of therapy to prevent PTSD after a bad experience.
*   **Treatment:** This means helping people who already have a mental health problem. An example is talk therapy to help someone who feels very sad.

**Results**

The researchers found 23 finished summary studies. Together, these studies looked at 175 different original research studies.

The main results showed that the research was not spread out evenly. There were gaps in what we know.

*   **Who was studied?** Most studies were about refugees and asylum seekers. Very few studies looked at people who were forced to move inside their own country. Also, more studies focused on adults than on children.
*   **What problems were studied?** Most of the research was about treatment for PTSD, the stress from bad memories. There were not as many studies about helping people with sadness (depression) or worry (anxiety).
*   **What kinds of help were studied?** Most studies looked at treatments for existing problems. Very few looked at ways to promote good mental health or prevent problems from starting. The most common treatments studied were different kinds of talk therapy, where people talk with a trained person to work through their feelings.

The researchers also found that many of the summary studies they looked at were not written very clearly. This made it hard to be sure about the quality of the research they described.

From this, the researchers concluded that the research we have today may not match the needs of people forced to flee their homes. Future studies should focus on the groups that have been left out, like children. They should also look at other problems like depression and anxiety. Finally, it is important to study ways to help people stay mentally well and prevent problems, not just treat them after they happen.","An overview of systematic reviews on mental health interventions for involuntary migrants

Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility tests are expected to reduce the time to clinically important results of a blood culture. This might enable clinicians to better target therapy to a person's needs, and thereby, improve health outcomes (mortality, length of hospital stay), and reduce unnecessary prescribing of broad‐spectrum antibiotics; thereby reducing antimicrobial resistance rates. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of rapid susceptibility testing versus standard susceptibility testing for bloodstream infections (BSIs). 
Search methods
To identify studies with selected outcomes, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, LILACS, and two trials registries, between 1987 and October 2020. We used 'bloodstream infection' and 'antimicrobial susceptibility tests' as search terms. We had no language or publication status limitations. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing (with a time‐to‐result of ≤ 8 hours) versus conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing in people with a BSI caused by any bacteria, as identified by a positive blood culture. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened references, full‐text reports of potentially relevant studies, extracted data from the studies, and assessed risk of bias. Any disagreement was discussed and resolved with a third review author. For mortality, a dichotomous outcome, we extracted the number of events in each arm, and presented a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) to compare rapid susceptibility testing to conventional methods. We used Review Manager 5.4 to meta‐analyse the data. For other outcomes, which are time‐to‐event outcomes (time‐to‐discharge from hospital, time‐to‐first appropriate antibiotic change), we conducted qualitative narrative synthesis, due to heterogeneity of outcome measures.  
Main results
We included six trials, with 1638 participants. For rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing compared to conventional methods, there was little or no difference in mortality between groups (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.46; 6 RCTs, 1638 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In subgroup analysis, for rapid genotypic or molecular antimicrobial susceptibility testing compared to conventional methods, there was little or no difference in mortality between groups (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.49; 4 RCTs, 1074 participants; low‐certainty evidence). For phenotypic rapid susceptibility testing compared to conventional methods, there was little or no difference in mortality between groups  (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.35; 2 RCTs, 564 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
In qualitative analysis, rapid susceptibility testing may make little or no difference in time‐to‐discharge (4 RCTs, 1165 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In qualitative analysis, rapid genotypic susceptibility testing compared to conventional testing may make little or no difference in time‐to‐appropriate antibiotic (3 RCTs, 929 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In subgroup analysis, rapid phenotypic susceptibility testing compared to conventional testing may improve time‐to‐appropriate antibiotic (RR ‐17.29, CI ‐45.05 to 10.47; 2 RCTs, 564 participants; low‐certainty evidence).  
Authors' conclusions
The theoretical benefits of rapid susceptibility testing have not been demonstrated to directly improve mortality, time‐to‐discharge, or time‐to‐appropriate antibiotic in these randomized studies. Future large prospective studies should be designed to focus on the most clinically meaningful outcomes, and aim to optimize blood culture pathways.

Comparing Fast and Standard Tests for Serious Blood Infections

### **Rationale**

A bloodstream infection is when germs get into your blood. This is a very serious illness. Doctors need to find the right medicine, called an antibiotic, to fight the germs. To do this, they run tests to see which medicine will work best.

The standard tests can take a few days to give results. During this time, doctors may use strong medicines that kill many types of germs. Using these strong medicines too often can lead to a bigger problem. Germs can learn to fight off the medicines. This creates ""superbugs"" that are very hard to treat.

New, faster tests are now available. These tests can find the right medicine in just a few hours. Researchers hoped that using these fast tests would help patients. They thought it could help doctors choose the right medicine sooner. This might help patients get better faster, spend less time in the hospital, and be less likely to die from the infection. This study was done to see if the new, fast tests were better than the standard tests for patients.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with its own patients. Instead, researchers looked for studies that had already been done. They wanted to combine the results from many studies to get a stronger answer.

They looked for a special type of study where patients are put into groups by chance. In these studies, one group of patients got the new, fast test to find the right medicine. The other group got the standard, slower test.

The researchers found six studies to look at. These studies included over 1600 people with bloodstream infections. The researchers compared the results from the fast-test groups with the results from the standard-test groups. They looked at what happened to the patients while they were being treated for their infection.

### **Results**

The researchers looked at three main things to see if the fast tests helped patients more than the standard tests.

First, they looked at how many people died from the infection. They found that there was no real difference between the groups. About the same number of people died whether they had the fast test or the standard test.

Second, they looked at how long people stayed in the hospital. The results showed that using the fast tests did not help people leave the hospital any sooner.

Third, they looked at how quickly doctors started using the right medicine for the infection. Overall, the fast tests did not seem to help doctors switch to the right medicine any faster than the standard tests.

The researchers noted that they were not very sure about these results. More research in the future could lead to a different answer. Based on the studies they looked at, the things people hoped the fast tests would do did not happen. The fast tests did not seem to help people live longer, get out of the hospital sooner, or get the right medicine faster. The researchers believe that bigger and better studies are needed to see if these fast tests can be used in a way that truly helps patients.","Tests for identifying the most suitable antibiotics for a bacterial blood infection: are rapid tests better than standard tests? 
What is the aim of this Cochrane Review? 
People with blood infections need urgent treatment with antibiotics. Identifying the bacteria causing the infection helps ensure the right antibiotic is given. Rapid susceptibility tests are a technology to do this quickly, and aim to improve care. We sought to evaluate whether their use reduce deaths or shortens the illness. 
Key messages 
Rapid susceptibility tests to identify an appropriate antibiotic quickly for people with blood sepsis may make little to no difference to: 
· how many people die within 30 days of diagnosis of blood sepsis;
· how long people stay in hospital; 
· whether given a suitable antibiotic. 
Larger studies will help determine if using rapid susceptibility tests improves these outcomes. 
What was studied in this review? 
Susceptibility tests are done in a laboratory, and measure whether bacteria can grow when exposed to a variety of antibiotics, to assure that the antibiotics given are active against the organism causing the infection. The standard approach is to culture the blood samples, but this takes up to 36 hours to obtain a result. Rapid tests to identify bacteria causing blood infections, and their susceptibilities to antibiotics, provide results in eight hours or less. These rapid susceptibility tests include: 
· tests that look at the direct effect of antibiotics on bacteria (called phenotypic tests); and 
· tests that look for particular genes in the bacteria to see if they are susceptible, or resistant, to an antibiotic (called genotypic tests). 
What are the main results of this review? 
We found six studies that involved 1638 adults with blood infections. All studies took place in specialized medical centres in high‐income countries in Europe, the USA, and East Asia. 
Compared with standard tests, rapid susceptibility tests may make little to no difference to 
· how many people died within 30 days (evidence from six studies in 1638 people);
· how long people stayed in hospital (4 studies in 1165 people); or
· how long it took for people to be given the right antibiotic to treat the infection (5 studies in 1493 people). 
Phenotypic rapid susceptibility tests may reduce the time it takes to receive the right antibiotic; but this is uncertain (evidence from 2 studies in 564 people). 
Genotypic rapid susceptibility tests may make little or no difference to the time it takes to receive the right antibiotic (evidence from 4 studies in 1074 people). 
Our confidence in the results is limited because:
· the numbers of deaths reported in the studies were too low to show an important difference; 
· the tests used and the results from the studies varied widely;
· the studies did not include enough participants to enable firm conclusions.
Further research is likely to change these results.
How up to date is this review? 
We included evidence published up to 21 October 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD013333.pub2,"Background
Demodex blepharitis is a chronic condition commonly associated with recalcitrant dry eye symptoms though many people with Demodex mites are asymptomatic. The primary cause of this condition in humans is two types of Demodex mites: Demodex folliculorum and Demodex brevis. There are varying reports of the prevalence of Demodex blepharitis among adults, and it affects both men and women equally. While Demodex mites are commonly treated with tea tree oil, the effectiveness of tea tree oil for treating Demodex blepharitis is not well documented. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of tea tree oil on ocular Demodex infestation in people with Demodex blepharitis. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2019, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; LILACS; ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We used no date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the databases on 18 June 2019. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared treatment with tea tree oil (or its components) versus another treatment or no treatment for people with Demodex blepharitis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts and then full text of records to determine their eligibility. The review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using Covidence. A third review author resolved any conflicts at all stages. 
Main results
We included six RCTs (1124 eyes of 562 participants; 17 to 281 participants per study) from the US, Korea, China, Australia, Ireland, and Turkey. The RCTs compared some formulation of tea tree oil to another treatment or no treatment. Included participants were both men and women, ranging from 39 to 55 years of age. All RCTs were assessed at unclear or high risk of bias in one or more domains. We also identified two RCTs that are ongoing or awaiting publications. 
Data from three RCTs that reported a short‐term mean change in the number of Demodex mites per eight eyelashes contributed to a meta‐analysis. We are uncertain about the mean reduction for the groups that received the tea tree oil intervention (mean difference [MD] 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24 to 1.16) at four to six weeks as compared to other interventions. Only one RCT reported data for long‐term changes, which found that the group that received intense pulse light as the treatment had complete eradication of Demodex mites at three months. We graded the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as very low. 
Three RCTs reported no evidence of a difference for participant reported symptoms measured on the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) between the tea tree oil group and the group receiving other forms of intervention. Mean differences in these studies ranged from ‐10.54 (95% CI – 24.19, 3.11) to 3.40 (95% CI ‐0.70 7.50). We did not conduct a meta‐analysis for this outcome given substantial statistical heterogeneity and graded the certainty of the evidence as low. 
One RCT provided information concerning visual acuity but did not provide sufficient data for between‐group comparisons. The authors noted that mean habitual LogMAR visual acuity for all study participants improved post‐treatment (mean LogMAR 1.16, standard deviation 0.26 at 4 weeks). We graded the certainty of evidence for this outcome as low. No RCTs provided data on mean change in number of cylindrical dandruff or the proportion of participants experiencing conjunctival injection or experiencing meibomian gland dysfunction. 
Three RCTs provided information on adverse events. One reported no adverse events. The other two described a total of six participants randomized to treatment with tea tree oil who experienced ocular irritation or discomfort that resolved with re‐educating the patient on application techniques and continuing use of the tea tree oil. We graded the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as very low. 
Authors' conclusions
The current review suggests that there is uncertainty related to the effectiveness of 5% to 50% tea tree oil for the short‐term treatment of Demodex blepharitis; however, if used, lower concentrations may be preferable in the eye care arena to avoid induced ocular irritation. Future studies should be better controlled, assess outcomes at long term (e.g. 10 to 12 weeks or beyond), account for patient compliance, and study the effects of different tea tree oil concentrations.

### **Plain Title**

Does Tea Tree Oil Help Treat an Eye Condition Caused by Tiny Mites?

### **Rationale**

Some people have a long-term eye problem that can make their eyelids red and sore. This problem is caused by tiny bugs, called mites, that live on our eyelashes. The name of this condition is Demodex blepharitis.

This eye problem can also cause dry eye. However, some people have these mites but do not feel any symptoms. This condition can affect both men and women.

Doctors sometimes suggest tea tree oil to treat these eyelid mites. But we are not sure if tea tree oil really works. We also need to know if it is safe to use near the eyes. For this reason, researchers did a study to learn more. They looked at past research to see if tea tree oil is a good and safe treatment.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study where researchers worked with patients. Instead, they looked at the results of other studies that were already finished. This is called a review. They searched for a special type of study where people are put into groups by chance to try different treatments. This is the best way to see if a treatment really works.

The researchers found 6 studies to include in their review. In total, these studies included 562 people. There were both men and women in the studies. Their ages were from 39 to 55 years old. All of the people in the studies had the eye problem caused by mites.

The studies that the researchers reviewed were short. Most of them lasted for about 4 to 6 weeks.

### **Results**

The researchers looked at the results from all 6 studies. It was hard to be sure about what they found. This is because the studies they reviewed were small or had some flaws in how they were done. This means we cannot be very sure about the results.

The studies checked if tea tree oil helped get rid of the mites. After 4 to 6 weeks of treatment, it was not clear if tea tree oil got rid of more mites than other treatments did. The evidence was not strong enough to know for sure.

The studies also asked patients how their eyes felt. People who used tea tree oil did not say their eyes felt better than people who used other treatments. Their dry eye symptoms did not improve more with tea tree oil.

A small number of people had side effects. In two of the studies, 6 people who used tea tree oil said it made their eyes feel sore or irritated. This problem went away when they were shown the right way to use the treatment.

The researchers who did this review concluded that we still do not know for sure if tea tree oil works well to treat this eye problem. If doctors do use tea tree oil, they should use a form that is not too strong. This may help to avoid eye irritation. The researchers believe we need new and better studies in the future. These new studies should last longer and check to see if patients use the treatment in the right way.","Tea tree oil for Demodex blepharitis
What was the aim of this review?To examine the effects of tea tree oil, an essential oil derived from an Australian tree, which can be applied in many different forms (eyelid wipes, eyelid shampoo, oil massages, etc.) on Demodex blepharitis. Demodex blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelid caused by Demodex mites (frequently referred to as eyelash mites). 
Key messagesWe are uncertain if tea tree oil is better compared to other treatments. Other factors such as dosage, ocular hygiene, and patient compliance likely affect treatment outcomes; however, more and better‐designed studies are needed to confirm these findings. 
What did we study in this review?Blepharitis causes symptoms such as eye itching, burning, dryness, irritation, watering, or blurry vision, which lead people to seek medical attention. This study aimed to understand the ability of tea tree oil to improve symptoms or to treat Demodex blepharitis (or both) in comparison to no treatment or other forms of treatment containing no tea tree oil. 
What were the main results of this review?This review included six studies with 562 participants (1124 eyes). They were men and women between the ages of 39 and 55 years. The included studies were conducted in the US, Korea, China, Australia, Ireland, and Turkey. Trial designs greatly varied, which limited analyses and the confidence in the results. Most studies included in this report had a high degree of bias. It is uncertain if tea tree oil (concentration ranging from 5% to 50%) is helpful for reducing the number of Demodex mites in people with Demodex blepharitis in short‐term cases. While not fully addressed in the reviewed literature, people should be educated on how to properly apply tea tree oil products because patient compliance and method of application likely affects efficacy. None of the studies in this review reported any side effects directly related to the treatment; however, one study did report irritation around the eyes on using tea tree oil, which was resolved on re‐educating the person on the application technique. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?Cochrane Review authors searched for trials that had been published before 18 June 2019.

10.1002-14651858.CD003737.pub4,"What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for intermittent exotropia (an eye co‐ordination problem that starts in childhood)? 
Key messages 
· Covering one eye with a patch improves the eye co‐ordination of children with intermittent exotropia more effectively than regular monitoring by an eye specialist. 
· Few studies have compared other treatments for intermittent exotropia, and those that have do not provide clear answers about their benefits and risks. 
· Well‐conducted studies are needed in this area to improve the management of intermittent exotropia. 
What is intermittent exotropia? 
Intermittent exotropia is an eye condition that develops in the first year of life. It causes one or both eyes to turn out toward the ear, typically when a child looks into the distance, daydreams, is tired, or is in bright sunlight. Only one eye turns out at a time, while the other eye points straight forwards. This can happen infrequently, or regularly throughout the day. 
What treatments are available for intermittent exotropia? 
Regular monitoring (observation) by an eye specialist may be all that is needed when a child’s eyes point in the same direction most of the time, or when intermittent exotropia does not affect vision. 
For children with more severe intermittent exotropia, several treatments are available, including: 
· eye exercises, to improve a child’s control over their eye movements;
· glasses, to encourage the eyes to work together;
· eye muscle surgery, to adjust the position of the eyes; and
· covering one eye with a patch, to strengthen the other eye.
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out:
· which treatment works best for intermittent exotropia; and
· whether treatments cause any unwanted (adverse) effects.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared different treatments for intermittent exotropia against each other. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found 6 studies that involved a total of 890 people who were mostly children aged 12 months to 10 years. The studies followed people for between six months and three years, and took place in the USA (four studies), India (one study), and Turkey (one study). The studies compared: 
· patching against observation (two studies); and
· different treatments involving surgery (four studies).
Patching compared to observation 
The evidence:
· shows that patching is better than observation for improving eye co‐ordination; and 
· suggests that patching and observation may have similar effects on sharpness of near vision. 
Different surgical procedures 
The evidence suggests that:
· surgery on the muscles that control the outward movement of both eyes is probably better for improving eye co‐ordination than surgery on the muscles that control both inward and outward movement in one eye; 
· these two procedures may have similar effects on sharpness of near vision and quality of life, and may lead to similar numbers of adverse effects (such as small lumps under the skin); and 
· there may be little to no difference in effect on eye co‐ordination when looking at distant objects between surgical procedures on the inside of the eye (‘plication’ and ‘resection’) when combined with surgery on the outside of the eye. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
The evidence is based on a small number of studies, and several studies may have used methods likely to introduce errors in their results. In general, the studies provided limited information about the benefits and risks of different treatments for intermittent exotropia. For example, they often did not investigate adverse effects or effects on sharpness of vision at a distance and quality of life. 
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
The evidence is current to January 2021.

What is the best way to treat an eye turn in children?

**Rationale**

**What is an eye turn?**
Some children have a problem with their eyes called intermittent exotropia. This is a big name for a simple problem. It means that one eye sometimes turns outward, toward the ear. The other eye will still look straight ahead.

This eye turn can happen when a child is tired. It can also happen when they look far away or are in bright sunlight. The eye turn may happen just a few times or many times a day.

**Why did we do this study?**
There are many ways to help children with an eye turn. Some children just need to be watched by an eye doctor. Others may need to do eye exercises. Some children get glasses.

Other treatments include wearing a patch over one eye. This helps make the other eye stronger. In some cases, doctors do surgery on the eye muscles to help the eyes point straight.

We do not know which way is best to treat this eye turn. We wanted to look at all the research. This can help us learn which treatments work best and which are safest for children.

**Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**
This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, our team looked at studies that were already done. We searched for studies that compared different treatments for this eye turn.

We found 6 studies to look at. In total, 890 people were in these studies. Most of them were children from 1 to 10 years old.

We looked at what each study found. We put all the results together. This helped us see what all the studies tell us as a group. The studies we looked at followed children for about 6 months to 3 years.

**Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**
Our review of the studies showed a few key things.

Putting a patch over one eye works better than just watching the child. The patch helps the child’s eyes work together better.

We also looked at different types of eye surgery. One type of surgery is done on the muscles of both eyes. Another type is done on the muscles of just one eye. The studies suggest that surgery on both eyes may work better to fix the eye turn. Both types of surgery seemed to be just as safe.

**What are the limits of this study?**
It is important to know that we do not have all the answers yet. We only found a small number of studies. Some of these studies were not designed as well as they could be. This means we cannot be fully sure of the results.

The studies did not always report on unwanted effects of the treatments. They also did not always check how the treatments affected a child’s vision from far away.

Because of this, we need more and better studies. Future research will help doctors and families make the best choices for children with an eye turn. For now, we know that eye patching is a good choice for some children.","What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for intermittent exotropia (an eye co‐ordination problem that starts in childhood)? 
Key messages 
· Covering one eye with a patch improves the eye co‐ordination of children with intermittent exotropia more effectively than regular monitoring by an eye specialist. 
· Few studies have compared other treatments for intermittent exotropia, and those that have do not provide clear answers about their benefits and risks. 
· Well‐conducted studies are needed in this area to improve the management of intermittent exotropia. 
What is intermittent exotropia? 
Intermittent exotropia is an eye condition that develops in the first year of life. It causes one or both eyes to turn out toward the ear, typically when a child looks into the distance, daydreams, is tired, or is in bright sunlight. Only one eye turns out at a time, while the other eye points straight forwards. This can happen infrequently, or regularly throughout the day. 
What treatments are available for intermittent exotropia? 
Regular monitoring (observation) by an eye specialist may be all that is needed when a child’s eyes point in the same direction most of the time, or when intermittent exotropia does not affect vision. 
For children with more severe intermittent exotropia, several treatments are available, including: 
· eye exercises, to improve a child’s control over their eye movements;
· glasses, to encourage the eyes to work together;
· eye muscle surgery, to adjust the position of the eyes; and
· covering one eye with a patch, to strengthen the other eye.
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out:
· which treatment works best for intermittent exotropia; and
· whether treatments cause any unwanted (adverse) effects.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared different treatments for intermittent exotropia against each other. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found 6 studies that involved a total of 890 people who were mostly children aged 12 months to 10 years. The studies followed people for between six months and three years, and took place in the USA (four studies), India (one study), and Turkey (one study). The studies compared: 
· patching against observation (two studies); and
· different treatments involving surgery (four studies).
Patching compared to observation 
The evidence:
· shows that patching is better than observation for improving eye co‐ordination; and 
· suggests that patching and observation may have similar effects on sharpness of near vision. 
Different surgical procedures 
The evidence suggests that:
· surgery on the muscles that control the outward movement of both eyes is probably better for improving eye co‐ordination than surgery on the muscles that control both inward and outward movement in one eye; 
· these two procedures may have similar effects on sharpness of near vision and quality of life, and may lead to similar numbers of adverse effects (such as small lumps under the skin); and 
· there may be little to no difference in effect on eye co‐ordination when looking at distant objects between surgical procedures on the inside of the eye (‘plication’ and ‘resection’) when combined with surgery on the outside of the eye. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
The evidence is based on a small number of studies, and several studies may have used methods likely to introduce errors in their results. In general, the studies provided limited information about the benefits and risks of different treatments for intermittent exotropia. For example, they often did not investigate adverse effects or effects on sharpness of vision at a distance and quality of life. 
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
The evidence is current to January 2021.

Finding the Best Way to Stop Bleeding During Surgery

**Rationale**

Some people are born with a health problem that makes them bleed easily. These are called bleeding disorders. One common type is called haemophilia. This means a person’s blood does not clot well. A blood clot is like a natural plug. It forms to stop the bleeding when you get a cut or an injury. When your blood does not clot well, even a small cut can lead to a lot of bleeding.

This can be a very serious problem during surgery. Any type of surgery involves cutting the skin and other tissues, which causes bleeding. For most people, this bleeding is easy to control and stops quickly. But for people with a bleeding disorder, it can be very dangerous. They can lose too much blood during and after an operation. This makes surgery much riskier for them.

Doctors have special medicines to help prevent this. These medicines help the blood to clot properly. But doctors are not sure about the best way to use these medicines for surgery. They do not know the exact right dose to give. They also do not know how long a person should get the medicine. This study looked at past research to try and find answers. The goal was to find the safest and best way to help people with bleeding disorders get through surgery without problems.

**Trial Design**

This was not a new study that tested medicines on people. Instead, the researchers did a review. A review means they looked for and studied all the research that had already been done on this topic. They looked for a special type of study called a randomized controlled trial. This is the best type of study to compare different treatments. In these studies, people are put into groups by chance to see which treatment works better.

The researchers found four studies that fit what they were looking for. Two of these studies looked at 59 people who had haemophilia A or B. These people were all having teeth pulled. They all got their usual medicine to help their blood clot. Then, some of them got an extra medicine. This medicine helps stop clots from breaking down. The other people got a placebo. A placebo is a dummy pill that has no medicine in it. This helps doctors see if the real medicine makes a difference.

The other two studies looked at 53 people. These people also had haemophilia A or B. But their bodies had a special problem. They made something called inhibitors. Inhibitors are like guards that stop the normal medicine from working. So, these people got a different type of clotting medicine. One study compared giving a high dose to a low dose. The other study compared giving the medicine all at once in one big dose to giving it slowly over time.

**Results**

The review of these four studies gave the researchers some information. However, this information was only for two very specific situations. One was for people having teeth taken out. The other was for people whose bodies fight the normal clotting medicine. The results did not provide clear answers for all the other types of surgery people might need. The review showed that there is not enough good proof from the best type of studies to make decisions.

This means we still do not know for sure the best way to treat everyone. For the many types of bleeding disorders and the many types of surgery, there is no one clear answer. We do not know the best dose of medicine. We also do not know the best amount of time to give the medicine to keep people safe. This review showed that there is a need for more research in this area to find clear answers.

The researchers concluded that more studies would be helpful. However, they also said that these studies are very difficult to do. At the moment, doctors are able to perform surgery safely on people with bleeding disorders. They do this based on what they have learned from their own experience. They also use information from other types of studies that are not as strict. So, while more research would be good, doctors are still able to provide good and safe care now.","Preventing bleeding in people with congenital bleeding disorders during and after surgery

Toxoplasmosis infection is caused by a parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. Eating or handling raw or insufficiently‐cooked meat, not washing hands thoroughly after gardening, handling contaminated soil or water, or contact with cats' faeces can cause infection. Usually it is asymptomatic and self‐limiting. Primary prevention involves educating the general public, filtering water and improving farm hygiene to reduce animal infection. 
If pregnant women have not previously been exposed to the parasite and develop antibodies while pregnant, the infection can be transmitted from the mother to the fetus (congenital toxoplasmosis). This is rare but potentially has serious consequences such as malformation, mental retardation, deafness and blindness of the infected infant, intrauterine death or stillbirth. The probability of infection is greater during the third trimester but the risk of the fetus developing major clinical signs is greater early in pregnancy. Pregnant women are often unaware of risk factors for congenital toxoplasmosis. Offering prenatal education could mean that women adopt simple behavioral measures to avoid toxoplasmosis. 
This review included two randomized controlled trials (involving 5455 women). Data could not be combined because each trial measured effectiveness in different ways. One study was from Canada and involved 432 women randomly assigned to a 10‐minute presentation during a prenatal class about toxoplasmosis prevention or to a usual prenatal class. Losses to follow‐up were high and 285 completed the post‐test questionnaire in the third trimester. Only 5% of the intervention women recalled having obtained information on toxoplasmosis prevention during prenatal classes. However, the authors concluded that prenatal education can effectively change pregnant women's behavior as it increased pet, personal and food hygiene. The other trial conducted in France involved 5023 pregnant women with no evidence of toxoplasmosis infection (seronegative) who were randomly assigned to receive a brochure and an audiotape containing information for toxoplasmosis prevention, or to a usual prenatal class. Losses to follow‐up were high and 2790 completed both pre‐test and post‐test questionnaire on behavior (44.5% loss to follow‐up), whereas 3949 women were tested for blood antibodies (22.4% loss to follow‐up). Women's behavior did not change after the intervention. Similarly, the seroconversion rate did not differ between groups (13 out of 2591 women seroconverted in the intervention and four out of 1358 in the control group). 
Both trials were judged as having low methodological quality as assessed by the GRADE approach. This limits our confidence in the results. Evidence supporting prenatal education to prevent congenital toxoplasmosis is therefore limited. 
","Here is a Plain Language Summary of the biomedical study abstract.

### **Plain Title**

Can Teaching Pregnant Women Help Prevent an Infection in Their Babies?

### **Rationale**

**What is toxoplasmosis?**

Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by a tiny living thing called a parasite. People can get this parasite in a few ways. You can get it from eating meat that is raw or not cooked enough. You can also get it from soil, like when you are gardening. Contact with cat poop can also spread the infection.

For most people, this infection is not serious. Many people have no signs of being sick, and it goes away on its own.

**Why is this infection a risk during pregnancy?**

If a woman gets this infection for the first time while she is pregnant, it can be very dangerous. She can pass the infection to her unborn baby. When a baby is born with the infection, it is called congenital toxoplasmosis.

This can cause very serious health problems for the baby. It can lead to problems with the baby’s brain or body. It can also cause blindness or deafness. In the most serious cases, the baby may die before birth.

**Why was this study done?**

Many women do not know how to avoid this infection. Researchers wanted to know if teaching pregnant women about toxoplasmosis could help them stay safe. The main idea was that if women learned about the risks, they would take simple steps to protect themselves and their babies.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at the results from two older studies. This is called a review. Both of these older studies were designed in a way to fairly test the teaching materials.

In these studies, pregnant women were put into groups by chance. One group received special teaching about how to prevent the infection. The other group received the usual care that all pregnant women get. This method helps show if the special teaching made a real difference.

**Who was in the studies?**

In total, about 5,500 pregnant women from Canada and France were in the two studies.

The first study, in Canada, had about 400 women. One group listened to a 10-minute talk about the infection. The other group took a normal pregnancy class.

The second study, in France, had about 5,000 women. All of these women had never had the infection before. One group got a booklet and an audio tape with information. The other group did not.

A problem in both studies was that many women who started did not finish them. This makes the results less certain.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The two studies had different results, and the researchers could not combine them.

In the study from Canada, the women who got the 10-minute talk seemed to change their habits. They were more careful with food, pets, and washing their hands. However, only 5 out of every 100 women in that group even remembered getting the talk.

In the study from France, the booklet and audio tape did not seem to change women’s habits. The number of women who got the infection during their pregnancy was about the same in both the teaching group and the usual care group.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

The researchers who did this review looked closely at how the two studies were done. They decided that both studies had weaknesses. This means we cannot be very confident in the results.

Right now, there is not strong proof that special teaching helps pregnant women avoid this infection. More and better studies are needed. This will help us learn the best ways to protect pregnant women and their babies from toxoplasmosis.","Prenatal education for congenital toxoplasmosis

Review Question 
What are the risks and benefits of eating food early, versus delaying food for at least 24 hours after abdominal gynaecologic surgery? 
Background 
Physicians often delay giving food and drink to women after abdominal gynaecologic surgery (uterine fibroids, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, uterine and ovarian cancer) until bowel function recommences (typically 24 hours after surgery). This is to reduce the risk of complications such as vomiting, gastrointestinal disruptions and wound rupturing or leakage. However, it has been suggested that some women may recover more quickly if food is introduced earlier. We reviewed evidence from randomised controlled trials of early and delayed feeding after abdominal gynaecologic surgery. 
Study Characteristics 
We assessed evidence on the following outcomes:
1. Nausea, vomiting, cramping abdominal pain, bloating, abdominal distension, wound complication, deep venous thrombosis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia. 
2. Time to first: bowel sound, gas, stool, start of regular diet.
3. Length of hospital stay
Early feeding was defined as having fluids or food within 24 hours of surgery. Delayed feeding was defined as having fluids or food 24 hours after surgery, and only if there are bowel sounds, passage of gas or stool, and a feeling of hunger. 
The evidence is current to April 2014
Key Results 
We included five published studies of 631 women, mainly with gynaecologic cancer.
Recovery of bowel function was faster in those with early feeding. There was no difference in rates of nausea or vomiting, abdominal distension, need for a postoperative nasogastric tube or time to first bowel movement, but early feeding was associated with a shorter time to bowel sounds and onset of gas. The early feeding group resumed a solid diet 1½ days sooner than those having delayed feeding and the hospital stay was one day shorter. Also, the early feeding group were more satisfied with the feeding schedule, although only one study reported this. 
Early feeding appeared safe, without increased postoperative complications and with fewer infectious complications overall. 
Quality of the Evidence 
Most of the evidence was moderate quality. The main limitation was lack of blinding, which could influence the findings for subjective outcomes such as self‐reported symptoms, hospital stay, patients' satisfaction and quality of life. 
Conclusions 
The evidence suggests that eating and drinking on the first day after abdominal gynaecologic surgery is safe and could reduce the length of hospital stay.

Is it Better to Eat Sooner After Surgery for Women's Health?

### **Rationale**

Some women need surgery on their belly for health problems with their female organs. These problems can include growths, cysts, or cancer.

After this type of surgery, doctors often have women wait to eat or drink. They usually wait for at least one day. Doctors do this to prevent problems like throwing up or bloating. They wait until they know the woman's belly is working again.

But some people think that eating sooner might help women get better faster. Researchers wanted to know what was safer and better for patients. This study looked at the risks and benefits of eating soon after surgery compared to waiting.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This paper did not do a new study. Instead, researchers looked at five past studies to find an answer. The studies they looked at were fair tests. They compared two groups of women who had surgery.

The women in these studies were put into two groups by chance:
*   **The early eating group:** These women were given food or drinks within one day of their surgery.
*   **The delayed eating group:** These women had to wait at least one day to eat. They could only eat after showing signs their belly was working again, like passing gas.

In total, the studies included 631 women. Most of these women had surgery for cancer of their female organs. The researchers looked at how each group felt after surgery. They also checked how long each group stayed in the hospital.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The study found that it was safe for women to eat soon after surgery. Eating early did not cause more problems.

Women who ate sooner got better faster in some ways.
*   Their bellies started working again more quickly. They passed gas sooner than women who waited to eat.
*   They were able to eat normal solid food about a day and a half sooner.
*   They were able to go home from the hospital one day earlier.

There was no difference between the groups in feeling sick or throwing up. The women who ate early also seemed to have fewer infections. In one study, women in the early eating group said they were happier with their food plan.

The researchers believe the proof from these studies is good. They concluded that eating on the first day after surgery is safe. It can help women recover and leave the hospital sooner.","Early versus delayed feeding for reducing complications after gynaecologic surgery

Can a Bone Drug Help People with Brittle Bone Disease?

**Rationale**

**What is brittle bone disease?**

Some people are born with a health problem called osteogenesis imperfecta. This is also known as brittle bone disease. It is a problem in the genes that can be passed down from a parent to a child.

People with this disease have bones that can break very easily. This can happen a lot during their life. There is no cure for brittle bone disease. Doctors look for ways to help manage the disease and make life better for patients.

**Why was this study done?**

Doctors sometimes use a type of drug called a bisphosphonate. This drug helps make bones stronger in older people who have weak bones. This condition is called osteoporosis.

Researchers wanted to know if this same drug could help people with brittle bone disease. They hoped the drug could make their bones stronger and reduce how often they break. This study looked at past research to find the answer.

**Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers did a review. They gathered the results from 14 different studies that were already completed. Looking at many studies at once can give a clearer picture of whether a treatment works.

All the people in the 14 studies had brittle bone disease. In each study, some people took a bisphosphonate drug. They took the drug either as a pill or through a needle in their arm.

The amount of time people were in each of the 14 studies was different. Researchers wanted to review all the information to see what we have learned so far about this drug for brittle bone disease.

**Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The review looked at two main questions. First, did the drug lead to fewer broken bones? Second, did the drug make bones stronger?

The review found that in most of the studies, the drug did not seem to lower the number of broken bones. This was the most important question, and the answer was not what researchers had hoped for.

However, the drug did help in another way. In all 14 studies, the drug made bones stronger. Doctors can measure bone strength with a special scan. This is called bone mineral density. The drug improved bone strength for the people who took it.

**What else did the study find?**

The researchers also wanted to know if the drug helped with bone pain or a person's quality of life. Quality of life means how a person feels about their health and daily life. The studies did not have enough information to answer these questions.

The researchers who did the review came to a few main conclusions. The drug does make bones stronger. But we still do not know for sure if it stops bones from breaking. We also need to learn more about how safe the drug is to use for a long time.

Many of the 14 studies were small. When a study has only a few people, it can be hard to see if a drug is making a real difference. Larger studies are needed in the future to get clear answers for people with brittle bone disease.","Bisphosphonate therapy for osteogenesis imperfecta

The evidence is current to: 28 April 2016.
Study characteristics 
This review looked at trials studying one of the groups of medications known as bisphosphonates which are more typically used to treat osteoporosis. They are used in osteogenesis imperfecta to try and reduce the number of bone fractures in affected individuals. 
We included 14 trials, and most of these did not show a major reduction in fractures in affected individuals when treated with bisphosphonates. 
Key results 
Each trial independently showed significant improvements in bone mineral density after treatment with oral or intravenous bisphosphonates. Bone pain, growth and quality of life indicators were not reported in enough detail and the effects of this treatment need further investigation. The long‐term effectiveness and safety of bisphosphates, as well as dose and duration of therapy, require extended evaluation 
Quality of the evidence 
The majority of trials analysed were small and not powered to show a statistically significant difference in many outcome measures.

The risk of venous thromboembolism is increased in adults and enhanced by asparaginase‐based chemotherapy, and venous thromboembolism introduces a secondary risk of treatment delay and premature discontinuation of key anti‐leukaemic agents, potentially compromising survival. Yet, the trade‐off between benefits and harms of primary thromboprophylaxis in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) treated according to asparaginase‐based regimens is uncertain.  
Objectives
The primary objectives were to assess the benefits and harms of primary thromboprophylaxis for first‐time symptomatic venous thromboembolism in adults with ALL receiving asparaginase‐based therapy compared with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis. 
The secondary objectives were to compare the benefits and harms of different groups of primary systemic thromboprophylaxis by stratifying the main results per type of drug (heparins, vitamin K antagonists, synthetic pentasaccharides, parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors, direct oral anticoagulants, and blood‐derived products for antithrombin substitution). 
Search methods
We conducted a comprehensive literature search on 02 June 2020, with no language restrictions, including (1) electronic searches of Pubmed/MEDLINE; Embase/Ovid; Scopus/Elsevier; Web of Science Core Collection/Clarivate Analytics; and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and (2) handsearches of (i) reference lists of identified studies and related reviews; (ii) clinical trials registries (ClinicalTrials.gov registry; the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) registry; the World Health Organisation's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP); and pharmaceutical manufacturers of asparaginase including Servier, Takeda, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Ohara Pharmaceuticals, and Kyowa Pharmaceuticals), and (iii) conference proceedings (from the annual meetings of the American Society of Hematology (ASH); the European Haematology Association (EHA); the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO); and the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH)). We conducted all searches from 1970 (the time of introduction of asparaginase in ALL treatment). We contacted the authors of relevant studies to identify any unpublished material, missing data, or information regarding ongoing studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs); including quasi‐randomised, controlled clinical, cross‐over, and cluster‐randomised trial designs) comparing any parenteral/oral preemptive anticoagulant or mechanical intervention with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis, or comparing two different pre‐emptive anticoagulant interventions in adults aged at least 18 years with ALL treated according to asparaginase‐based chemotherapy regimens. For the description of harms, non‐randomised observational studies with a control group were eligible for inclusion.  
Data collection and analysis
Using a standardised data collection form, two review authors independently screened and selected studies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias for each outcome using standardised tools (RoB 2.0 tool for RCTs and ROBINS‐I tool for non‐randomised studies) and the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. Primary outcomes included first‐time symptomatic venous thromboembolism, all‐cause mortality, and major bleeding. Secondary outcomes included asymptomatic venous thromboembolism, venous thromboembolism‐related mortality, adverse events (i.e. clinically relevant non‐major bleeding and heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia for trials using heparins), and quality of life. Analyses were performed according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. For non‐randomised studies, we evaluated all studies (including studies judged to be at critical risk of bias in at least one of the ROBINS‐I domains) in a sensitivity analysis exploring confounding.  
Main results
We identified 23 non‐randomised studies that met the inclusion criteria of this review, of which 10 studies provided no outcome data for adults with ALL. We included the remaining 13 studies in the 'Risk of bias' assessment, in which we identified invalid control group definition in two studies and judged outcomes of nine studies to be at critical risk of bias in at least one of the ROBINS‐I domains and outcomes of two studies at serious risk of bias. 
We did not assess the benefits of thromboprophylaxis, as no RCTs were included. In the main descriptive analysis of harms, we included two retrospective non‐randomised studies with outcomes judged to be at serious risk of bias. One study evaluated antithrombin concentrates compared to no antithrombin concentrates. We are uncertain whether antithrombin concentrates have an effect on all‐cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 1.19 (intention‐to‐treat analysis); one study, 40 participants; very low certainty of evidence). We are uncertain whether antithrombin concentrates have an effect on venous thromboembolism‐related mortality (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.94 (intention‐to‐treat analysis); one study, 40 participants; very low certainty of evidence). We do not know whether antithrombin concentrates have an effect on major bleeding, clinically relevant non‐major bleeding, and quality of life in adults with ALL treated with asparaginase‐based chemotherapy, as data were insufficient. The remaining study (224 participants) evaluated prophylaxis with low‐molecular‐weight heparin versus no prophylaxis. However, this study reported insufficient data regarding harms including all‐cause mortality, major bleeding, venous thromboembolism‐related mortality, clinically relevant non‐major bleeding, heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia, and quality of life. 
In the sensitivity analysis of harms, exploring the effect of confounding, we also included nine non‐randomised studies with outcomes judged to be at critical risk of bias primarily due to uncontrolled confounding. Three studies (179 participants) evaluated the effect of antithrombin concentrates and six studies (1224 participants) evaluated the effect of prophylaxis with different types of heparins. When analysing all‐cause mortality; venous thromboembolism‐related mortality; and major bleeding (studies of heparin only) including all studies with extractable outcomes for each comparison (antithrombin and low‐molecular‐weight heparin), we observed small study sizes; few events; wide CIs crossing the line of no effect; and substantial heterogeneity by visual inspection of the forest plots. Although the observed heterogeneity could arise through the inclusion of a small number of studies with differences in participants; interventions; and outcome assessments, the likelihood that bias due to uncontrolled confounding was the cause of heterogeneity is inevitable. Subgroup analyses were not possible due to insufficient data.  
Authors' conclusions
We do not know from the currently available evidence, if thromboprophylaxis used for adults with ALL treated according to asparaginase‐based regimens is associated with clinically appreciable benefits and acceptable harms. The existing research on this question is solely of non‐randomised design, seriously to critically confounded, and underpowered with substantial imprecision. Any estimates of effect based on the existing insufficient evidence is very uncertain and is likely to change with future research.

### **Plain Title**

Do Blood Thinners Help Prevent Clots in Adults with a Certain Type of Leukemia?

### **Rationale**

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, is a type of blood cancer. People with ALL often get a cancer medicine called asparaginase. This medicine is an important part of treatment that helps fight the cancer.

But this cancer treatment can cause a serious problem. It increases the risk of getting blood clots. Blood clots are clumps of blood that form inside your body. They can block blood flow and be very dangerous. A clot can travel to the lungs or brain, which can be life-threatening. If a person gets a blood clot, they may also have to stop their cancer treatment. This can make it harder to get well.

Doctors have medicines called blood thinners that can help prevent blood clots. But blood thinners have their own risks. They can sometimes cause too much bleeding. Doctors face a difficult choice. Should they give a medicine to prevent a dangerous clot, even if that medicine might cause dangerous bleeding? Without good research, it is hard to know the right answer.

This study tried to answer that question. Researchers looked at all the past studies on this topic. They wanted to find out if using blood thinners is safe and helpful for adults with ALL who are getting this cancer treatment.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers did a review. Think of it like being a detective. The researchers gathered all the clues from past medical research. They looked at how each study was done. They then planned to put the good clues together to solve the mystery of whether blood thinners work for these patients.

The researchers looked for studies that included adults with ALL. These adults had to be 18 years of age or older. They also had to be getting the cancer medicine asparaginase.

The researchers wanted to find the best type of study, called a randomized controlled trial. In these studies, people are put into groups by chance. One group gets the new treatment, and the other group gets the standard treatment or no treatment. This is the fairest way to compare treatments and see which one really works best.

### **Results**

The researchers looked very hard for studies. But they could not find any high-quality studies that answered their question. No randomized controlled trials had been done on this topic. This means they could not find good proof about the benefits of using blood thinners for these patients.

The researchers did find some studies of lower quality. But these studies had problems in how they were designed. For example, maybe the patients who got blood thinners were already healthier than those who did not. This would make the blood thinner look better than it really is. Because of these problems, the results from these studies are hard to trust.

Because the studies were not high quality, the results were very unclear. The researchers could not tell if blood thinners helped prevent clots. They also could not tell if the blood thinners caused harm, like major bleeding. The information from these studies was just not good enough to know for sure.

The main conclusion from the review is that we still do not know the answer. We do not know if using blood thinners is a good or a bad idea for adults with ALL on this cancer treatment. The research that exists today cannot tell us. This means that we need new, high-quality studies to find a clear answer for patients and their doctors.","Prevention of blood clots in adults diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and treated with asparaginase‐based chemotherapy 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether currently available medications for prevention of blood clots have an appreciable balance between benefits and harms in adults with a subtype of blood cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) treated with asparaginase‐containing chemotherapy.  
Key messages 
We are uncertain whether blood‐derived products such as antithrombin concentrates for the prevention of blood clots in adults with ALL treated with asparaginase‐based chemotherapy are associated with unacceptable harms such as death. Our confidence in the identified studies is limited because of their non‐randomised design with few participants and no control for underlying factors that could influence the outcome. 
Harms regarding other types of blood clot prevention such as low‐molecular‐weight heparin could not be evaluated, because death and bleeding were not reported.  We did not look at benefits such as reduction in risk of blot clots, given the low quality of identified evidence (no randomised studies). We need high‐quality randomised studies, as the conduct of such studies minimises the risk of underlying factors influencing the outcomes.  
What was studied in this review?  
ALL is a subtype of blood cancer arising from malignant transformation of immature white blood cells of lymphoid origin. Over the last 20 years, the historically poor survival in adults with this disease has markedly improved, primarily due to the introduction of more intensive anti‐leukaemic treatment inspired by that used in children with ALL. One of the hallmarks of this treatment is the intensive use of the anti‐leukaemic agent called asparaginase. However, nothing comes without a price. Both older age and asparaginase treatment increase the risk of blood clots, which can either block the blood vessels (predominantly in those called veins) and change the normal blood flow or shower fractions of the clot into other veins located in important organs, resulting in serious health problems. Additionally, doctors are prone to stop asparaginase treatment, if blood clots occur—potentially compromising survival in these people.  
We do not know if the existing types of blood clot prevention protect against the clots and do not cause bleeding and death in adults with this disease. The medications include heparins, vitamin K antagonists, synthetic pentasaccharides, direct thrombin inhibitors, direct oral anticoagulants, or blood‐derived products for antithrombin substitution (decreased production in the body of this anti‐blood clotting protein during asparaginase), and mechanical prevention such as graduated elastic stockings.  
Therefore, we looked at all currently available research in adults with ALL treated with asparaginase‐containing chemotherapy who received blood clot prevention compared to placebo or no prevention. We looked at the following outcomes: first‐time symptomatic venous blood clot, all‐cause death, major bleeding, blood clot‐related death, asymptomatic venous blood clot, clinically relevant non‐major bleeding, heparin‐induced lowering of blood platelet counts, and quality of life. 
What are the results of this review? 
We found 23 studies, of which we included two studies in our main analyses to help answer the question and nine studies in an additional analysis to help describe the limitations of the evidence. The remaining 12 studies could not be included due to missing outcomes or critical risk of bias, as people in the control group were not 'real' controls.  
The two studies from our main analysis were conducted in UK/Canada and compared antithrombin with no antithrombin concentrates and low‐molecular‐weight heparin with no low‐molecular‐weight heparin, respectively, for people with ALL. We are uncertain whether antithrombin concentrates in adults with ALL treated with asparaginase‐based chemotherapy improve/reduce all‐cause/blood clot‐related death, because our confidence in the evidence was very low (one study, 40 adults). Harms in relation to the use of low‐molecular‐weight heparin could not be evaluated, because all‐cause/blood clot‐related death, major/clinically relevant non‐major bleeding, or heparin‐induced lowering of platelets were not reported. None of the studies looked at quality of life.  
No studies were found that evaluated any of the other prevention types. We did not look at benefits such as reduction in risk of blood clots, given the low certainty of evidence. 
How up to date is this review? 
The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to 02 June, 2020.

Every year, at least one million children become ill with tuberculosis and around 200,000 children die. Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra are World Health Organization (WHO)‐recommended rapid molecular tests that simultaneously detect tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults and children with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis, at lower health system levels. To inform updated WHO guidelines on molecular assays, we performed a systematic review on the diagnostic accuracy of these tests in children presumed to have active tuberculosis. 
Objectives
Primary objectives 
• To determine the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra for (a) pulmonary tuberculosis in children presumed to have tuberculosis; (b) tuberculous meningitis in children presumed to have tuberculosis; (c) lymph node tuberculosis in children presumed to have tuberculosis; and (d) rifampicin resistance in children presumed to have tuberculosis 
‐ For tuberculosis detection, index tests were used as the initial test, replacing standard practice (i.e. smear microscopy or culture) 
‐ For detection of rifampicin resistance, index tests replaced culture‐based drug susceptibility testing as the initial test 
Secondary objectives 
• To compare the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra for each of the four target conditions 
• To investigate potential sources of heterogeneity in accuracy estimates
‐ For tuberculosis detection, we considered age, disease severity, smear‐test status, HIV status, clinical setting, specimen type, high tuberculosis burden, and high tuberculosis/HIV burden 
‐ For detection of rifampicin resistance, we considered multi‐drug‐resistant tuberculosis burden 
• To compare multiple Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra results (repeated testing) with the initial Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra result 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trials Number (ISRCTN) Registry up to 29 April 2019, without language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
Randomized trials, cross‐sectional trials, and cohort studies evaluating Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra in HIV‐positive and HIV‐negative children younger than 15 years. Reference standards comprised culture or a composite reference standard for tuberculosis and drug susceptibility testing or MTBDRplus (molecular assay for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and drug resistance) for rifampicin resistance. We included studies evaluating sputum, gastric aspirate, stool, nasopharyngeal or bronchial lavage specimens (pulmonary tuberculosis), cerebrospinal fluid (tuberculous meningitis), fine needle aspirates, or surgical biopsy tissue (lymph node tuberculosis). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality using the Quality Assessment of Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy ‐ Revised (QUADAS‐2). For each target condition, we used the bivariate model to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We stratified all analyses by type of reference standard. We assessed certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
For pulmonary tuberculosis, 299 data sets (68,544 participants) were available for analysis; for tuberculous meningitis, 10 data sets (423 participants) were available; for lymph node tuberculosis, 10 data sets (318 participants) were available; and for rifampicin resistance, 14 data sets (326 participants) were available. Thirty‐nine studies (80%) took place in countries with high tuberculosis burden. Risk of bias was low except for the reference standard domain, for which risk of bias was unclear because many studies collected only one specimen for culture. 
Detection of pulmonary tuberculosis 
For sputum specimens, Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity (95% CI) and specificity (95% CI) verified by culture were 64.6% (55.3% to 72.9%) (23 studies, 493 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and 99.0% (98.1% to 99.5%) (23 studies, 6119 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). For other specimen types (nasopharyngeal aspirate, 4 studies; gastric aspirate, 14 studies; stool, 11 studies), Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity ranged between 45.7% and 73.0%, and pooled specificity ranged between 98.1% and 99.6%. 
For sputum specimens, Xpert Ultra pooled sensitivity (95% CI) and specificity (95% CI) verified by culture were 72.8% (64.7% to 79.6%) (3 studies, 136 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and 97.5% (95.8% to 98.5%) (3 studies, 551 participants; high‐certainty evidence). For nasopharyngeal specimens, Xpert Ultra sensitivity (95% CI) and specificity (95% CI) were 45.7% (28.9% to 63.3%) and 97.5% (93.7% to 99.3%) (1 study, 195 participants). 
For all specimen types, Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra sensitivity were lower against a composite reference standard than against culture. 
Detection of tuberculous meningitis 
For cerebrospinal fluid, Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity, verified by culture, were 54.0% (95% CI 27.8% to 78.2%) (6 studies, 28 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and 93.8% (95% CI 84.5% to 97.6%) (6 studies, 213 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Detection of lymph node tuberculosis 
For lymph node aspirates or biopsies, Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity, verified by culture, were 90.4% (95% CI 55.7% to 98.6%) (6 studies, 68 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and 89.8% (95% CI 71.5% to 96.8%) (6 studies, 142 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Detection of rifampicin resistance 
Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity were 90.0% (67.6% to 97.5%) (6 studies, 20 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and 98.3% (87.7% to 99.8%) (6 studies, 203 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
We found Xpert MTB/RIF sensitivity to vary by specimen type, with gastric aspirate specimens having the highest sensitivity followed by sputum and stool, and nasopharyngeal specimens the lowest; specificity in all specimens was > 98%. Compared with Xpert MTB/RIF, Xpert Ultra sensitivity in sputum was higher and specificity slightly lower. Xpert MTB/RIF was accurate for detection of rifampicin resistance. Xpert MTB/RIF was sensitive for diagnosing lymph node tuberculosis. For children with presumed tuberculous meningitis, treatment decisions should be based on the entirety of clinical information and treatment should not be withheld based solely on an Xpert MTB/RIF result. The small numbers of studies and participants, particularly for Xpert Ultra, limits our confidence in the precision of these estimates.

How Good Are Two Quick Tests for Finding Tuberculosis (TB) in Children?

**Rationale**

Tuberculosis, also called TB, is a serious illness caused by a germ. It most often affects the lungs. Each year, about one million children get sick with TB, and many die from it.

Finding TB in children can be hard. The usual tests can be slow. This means that children may have to wait a long time to get the right medicine.

This study looked at two newer, faster tests. They are called Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra. Researchers wanted to know how well these tests find TB in children. They also wanted to see if the tests could find a type of TB that is hard to treat with the usual drugs. This is called drug-resistant TB.

The World Health Organization, a global group that works on health, needed this information. They use studies like this one to make guides for doctors on the best tests to use for children.

**Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at many past studies. They put the results of these studies together to get a better answer. This is called a systematic review.

The studies included children under the age of 15. All of the children were thought to have TB. The studies took place in many parts of the world.

To do the tests, doctors took samples from the children. The samples could be spit, fluid from the tummy, or tissue from glands in the body. For TB in the brain, doctors took fluid from around the spine.

The researchers compared how well the two fast tests worked against the older, slower tests. The older tests are very good but take a long time because they involve growing the TB germ in a lab.

**Results**

The study found that the fast tests were good at finding TB, but how well they worked depended on the type of TB and where the sample came from.

**For TB in the lungs:**

*   The Xpert MTB/RIF test found TB in about 6 or 7 out of every 10 children who had it. The test was very good at telling when a child did not have TB. It was correct for 99 out of 100 children who were healthy.
*   The newer test, Xpert Ultra, was a bit better at finding TB in the lungs. It found TB in about 7 out of 10 children who had it.

**For other types of TB:**

*   The Xpert MTB/RIF test was very good at finding TB in the body’s glands (lymph nodes). It found the illness in about 9 out of 10 children who had it.
*   The test was not as good at finding TB in the fluid around the brain and spine. It found this type of TB in only about 5 out of 10 children who had it.

**For drug-resistant TB:**

*   The Xpert MTB/RIF test was also good at finding TB that is resistant to the usual drugs. It correctly found this type of TB in about 9 out of 10 children who had it.

The researchers concluded that these fast tests are useful tools. The newer Xpert Ultra test seems to be slightly better at finding lung TB than the older Xpert MTB/RIF test. However, for serious types of TB, like TB in the brain, doctors should not rely only on these tests. They need to look at all of the child’s symptoms to decide on the best treatment. More studies are needed to be more certain about these results, especially for the newer Xpert Ultra test.","Xpert tests for active tuberculosis in children
Why is improving the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis important? 
In 2018, at least one million children became ill with tuberculosis and around 200,000 died. When detected early and effectively treated, tuberculosis is largely curable. Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra are World Health Organization‐recommended tests that simultaneously detect tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults and children with tuberculosis symptoms. Rifampicin is an important anti‐tuberculosis drug. Not recognizing tuberculosis early may result in delayed diagnosis and treatment, severe illness, and death. A false tuberculosis diagnosis may result in anxiety and unnecessary treatment. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To determine the accuracy of tests in symptomatic children for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, and rifampicin resistance. 
What was studied in this review? 
Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra, with results measured against culture and a composite reference standard (benchmarks), recognizing that neither reference is perfect in children. 
What are the main results in this review? 
A total of 49 studies were included. For pulmonary tuberculosis, we analysed 299 data sets including information describing nearly 70,000 children. 
For a population of 1000 children:
Xpert MTB/RIF 
‐ where 100 have pulmonary tuberculosis in sputum (by culture), 74 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 9 (12%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); 926 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative; and 35 (4%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives) 
‐ where 100 have tuberculous meningitis (by culture), 86 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 59 (69%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); 914 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative; and 23 (3%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives) 
‐ where 100 people have lymph node tuberculosis (by culture), 142 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 97 (68%) would not have lymph node tuberculosis (false‐positives); 858 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative; and 5 (1%) would have lymph node TB (false‐negatives) 
‐ where 100 have rifampicin resistance, 108 would have Xpert MTB/RIF‐rifampicin resistance detected, of whom 18 (17%) would not have rifampicin resistance (false‐positives); 892 would have Xpert MTB/RIF‐rifampicin resistance NOT detected; and 10 (1%) would have rifampicin resistance (false‐negatives) 
Xpert Ultra 
‐ where 100 have pulmonary tuberculosis in sputum (by culture), 100 would be Xpert Ultra‐positive, of whom 27 (27%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); 900 would be Xpert Ultra‐negative; and 27 (3%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives) 
How confident are we in the results of this review? 
We are confident. We included many studies from different countries and settings and used two reference standards. Some studies included only children at referral centres or did not report the setting. Therefore, we could not assess how the tests would work in a primary care setting. 
What children do the results of this review apply to? 
Children with presumed pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, or rifampicin resistance. 
What are the implications of this review? 
The results of the review suggest Xpert tests have the potential to be used to detect tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. 
‐ The risk of missing a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis confirmed by culture with Xpert MTB/RIF (in sputum) is low (4% of those whose Xpert MTB/RIF suggests they do not have tuberculosis) suggesting that only a small number of children with tuberculosis confirmed by culture will not receive treatment. The risk of wrongly diagnosing a child as having tuberculosis is slightly higher (12% of those whose Xpert MTB/RIF test suggests they do have tuberculosis). This may result in some of these children receiving unnecessary treatment. 
‐ The risk of missing a diagnosis of rifampicin resistance with Xpert MTB/RIF is low (1% of those whose Xpert MTB/RIF suggests they do not have rifampicin resistance) suggesting that only a small number of children with tuberculosis will not receive the appropriate treatment. The risk of wrongly diagnosing a child as rifampicin resistance tuberculosis is higher (17% of those whose Xpert MTB/RIF test suggests they do have rifampicin resistance). This may result in some of these children receiving unnecessary treatment.

Tuberculosis is the primary cause of hospital admission in people living with HIV, and the likelihood of death in the hospital is unacceptably high. The Alere Determine TB LAM Ag test (AlereLAM) is a point‐of‐care test and the only lateral flow lipoarabinomannan assay (LF‐LAM) assay currently commercially available and recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). A 2019 Cochrane Review summarised the diagnostic accuracy of LF‐LAM for tuberculosis in people living with HIV. This systematic review assesses the impact of the use of LF‐LAM (AlereLAM) on mortality and other patient‐important outcomes. 
Objectives
To assess the impact of the use of LF‐LAM (AlereLAM) on mortality in adults living with HIV in inpatient and outpatient settings. 
To assess the impact of the use of LF‐LAM (AlereLAM) on other patient‐important outcomes in adults living with HIV, including time to diagnosis of tuberculosis, and time to initiation of tuberculosis treatment. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase (Ovid); Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science), BIOSIS Previews, Scopus, LILACS; ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; ClinicalTrials.gov; and the WHO ICTRP up to 12 March 2021. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials that compared a diagnostic intervention including LF‐LAM with diagnostic strategies that used smear microscopy, mycobacterial culture, a nucleic acid amplification test such as Xpert MTB/RIF, or a combination of these tests. We included adults (≥ 15 years) living with HIV. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility, extracted data, and analysed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized studies. We contacted study authors for clarification as needed. We used risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used a fixed‐effect model except in the presence of clinical or statistical heterogeneity, in which case we used a random‐effects model. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included three trials, two in inpatient settings and one in outpatient settings. All trials were conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa and assessed the impact of diagnostic strategies that included LF‐LAM on mortality when the test was used in conjunction with other tuberculosis diagnostic tests or clinical assessment for clinical decision‐making in adults living with HIV. 
Inpatient settings  
In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy likely reduces mortality in people living with HIV at eight weeks compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (pooled RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.94; 5102 participants, 2 trials; moderate‐certainty evidence). That is, people living with HIV who received LF‐LAM had 15% lower risk of mortality. The absolute effect was 34 fewer deaths per 1000 (from 14 fewer to 55 fewer). 
In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy probably results in a slight increase in the proportion of people living with HIV who were started on tuberculosis treatment compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (pooled RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.69; 5102 participants, 2 trials; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
Outpatient settings 
In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may reduce mortality in people living with HIV at six months compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.11; 2972 participants, 1 trial; low‐certainty evidence). Although this trial did not detect a difference in mortality, the direction of effect was towards a mortality reduction, and the effect size was similar to that in inpatient settings.  
In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may result in a large increase in the proportion of people living with HIV who were started on tuberculosis treatment compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (RR 5.44, 95% CI 4.70 to 6.29, 3022 participants, 1 trial; low‐certainty evidence). 
Other patient‐important outcomes 
Assessment of other patient‐important and implementation outcomes in the trials varied. The included trials demonstrated that a higher proportion of people living with HIV were able to produce urine compared to sputum for tuberculosis diagnostic testing; a higher proportion of people living with HIV were diagnosed with tuberculosis in the group that received LF‐LAM; and the incremental diagnostic yield was higher for LF‐LAM than for urine or sputum Xpert MTB/RIF. 
Authors' conclusions
In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic testing strategy likely reduces mortality and probably results in a slight increase in tuberculosis treatment initiation in people living with HIV. The reduction in mortality may be due to earlier diagnosis, which facilitates prompt treatment initiation. In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may reduce mortality and may result in a large increase in tuberculosis treatment initiation in people living with HIV. Our results support the implementation of LF‐LAM to be used in conjunction with other WHO‐recommended tuberculosis diagnostic tests to assist in the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis in people living with HIV.

A Fast Urine Test to Find Tuberculosis (TB) and Save Lives in People with HIV

### **Rationale**

**What is the health problem?**

Tuberculosis, or TB, is a serious sickness that often affects the lungs. It is a big problem for people who have HIV. HIV is a virus that weakens the body’s power to fight sickness.

When people with HIV get TB, they often become very sick and need to go to the hospital. Sadly, many of these people die in the hospital from TB.

**Why was this study done?**

To save lives, doctors need to find and treat TB as fast as they can. Some tests for TB can be slow. A new, faster test for TB is now available. It is a simple urine test.

Researchers in this study wanted to know if using this fast urine test could help people with HIV live longer. They believed that finding TB earlier would allow people to start taking TB medicine sooner, which could save their lives.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at the results of three large studies that were already completed. All the studies took place in Africa.

All the people in the studies were adults who were living with HIV. Some were very sick in the hospital. Others were visiting a health clinic.

In each study, people were put into two groups by chance.
*   One group got the usual tests that doctors use to find TB.
*   The other group got the usual TB tests **plus** the new, fast urine test.

Researchers then compared the two groups. They looked at how many people died. They also looked at how many people started TB medicine. They checked on the people for up to six months.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The fast urine test helped people both in the hospital and in clinics.

**For people in the hospital:**
*   The fast urine test helped save lives. In the group that got the fast urine test, fewer people died.
*   For every 1000 people with HIV in the hospital who were tested, the fast test helped save about 34 lives.
*   More people in this group were also able to start taking medicine for TB.

**For people visiting a clinic:**
*   The fast urine test may also help save the lives of people who were not in the hospital.
*   The results showed that a much larger number of people who got the fast test were able to start their TB medicine.

**What else did the study show?**
*   It was easier for people to give a sample of urine for the test than a sample of mucus from their lungs.
*   The fast urine test found TB in some people, even when other tests did not.

**What do these results mean?**

The study leaders believe the fast urine test is a very helpful tool. Using this test along with other TB tests helps doctors find TB early in people with HIV. Finding TB early means people can start medicine sooner. This helps them live longer. The researchers support using this test to help save the lives of people with HIV.","Impact of diagnostic strategies for tuberculosis using lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan test in people living with HIV 
What was the aim of this review? 
Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death in people living with HIV. The disease is particularly difficult to diagnose in people living with HIV, in part because it is often challenging to produce sputum for diagnosis. The lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan test (LF‐LAM) is a World Health Organization (WHO)‐recommended rapid test to assist in the detection of active tuberculosis in people living with HIV. This review is limited to studies that used the Alere Determine TB LAM Ag test (AlereLAM), which is the only LF‐LAM test currently recommended by the WHO; thus LF‐LAM refers only to AlereLAM in this review. Rapid and early tuberculosis diagnosis may allow for prompt treatment and prevent severe illness and death. The aim of this review was to determine whether the use of LF‐LAM testing had an effect on death and other patient‐important outcomes in people living with HIV. 
Key messages 
In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic testing strategy likely reduces deaths and probably results in a slight increase in tuberculosis treatment initiation in people living with HIV.  
In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may reduce deaths and may result in a large increase in tuberculosis treatment initiation in people living with HIV. 
What was studied in the review? 
We searched for trials in adults (15 years and older) that evaluated the effect of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy that included the LF‐LAM test compared to standard care using other WHO‐recommended diagnostic tests in adults living with HIV. 
What were the main results of the review? 
We identified three trials, two in inpatient settings and one in outpatient settings.
Inpatient settings 
In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy likely reduces mortality in people living with HIV at eight weeks compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (2 trials, 5102 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). 
In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy probably results in a slight increase in the proportion of people living with HIV who were started on tuberculosis treatment compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (2 trials, 5102 participants moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Outpatient settings 
In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may reduce mortality in people living with HIV at six months compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (1 trial, 2972 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may result in a large increase in the proportion of people living with HIV who were started on tuberculosis treatment compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (1 trial, 3022 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
Other patient‐important outcomes 
The included studies assessed other patient‐important outcomes in different ways. The studies demonstrated that more people living with HIV were able to produce urine compared to sputum for tuberculosis diagnostic testing, and more people living with HIV were diagnosed with tuberculosis in the group that received LF‐LAM. 
How up‐to‐date is the review? 
We searched for relevant trials up to 12 March 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013739.pub2,"Background
The primary manifestation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is respiratory insufficiency that can also be related to diffuse pulmonary microthrombosis and thromboembolic events, such as pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, or arterial thrombosis. People with COVID‐19 who develop thromboembolism have a worse prognosis. 
Anticoagulants such as heparinoids (heparins or pentasaccharides), vitamin K antagonists and direct anticoagulants are used for the prevention and treatment of venous or arterial thromboembolism. Besides their anticoagulant properties, heparinoids have an additional anti‐inflammatory potential. However, the benefit of anticoagulants for people with COVID‐19 is still under debate. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of anticoagulants versus active comparator, placebo or no intervention in people hospitalised with COVID‐19. 
Search methods
We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and IBECS databases, the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and medRxiv preprint database from their inception to 14 April 2021. We also checked the reference lists of any relevant systematic reviews identified, and contacted specialists in the field for additional references to trials. 
Selection criteria
Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, cluster‐RCTs and cohort studies that compared prophylactic anticoagulants versus active comparator, placebo or no intervention for the management of people hospitalised with COVID‐19. We excluded studies without a comparator group and with a retrospective design (all previously included studies) as we were able to include better study designs. Primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality and necessity for additional respiratory support. Secondary outcomes were mortality related to COVID‐19, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, major bleeding, adverse events, length of hospital stay and quality of life. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used Cochrane RoB 1 to assess the risk of bias for RCTs, ROBINS‐I to assess risk of bias for non‐randomised studies (NRS) and GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. We meta‐analysed data when appropriate. 
Main results
We included seven studies (16,185 participants) with participants hospitalised with COVID‐19, in either intensive care units, hospital wards or emergency departments. Studies were from Brazil (2), Iran (1), Italy (1), and the USA (1), and two involved more than country. The mean age of participants was 55 to 68 years and the follow‐up period ranged from 15 to 90 days. The studies assessed the effects of heparinoids, direct anticoagulants or vitamin K antagonists, and reported sparse data or did not report some of our outcomes of interest: necessity for additional respiratory support, mortality related to COVID‐19, and quality of life. 
Higher‐dose versus lower‐dose anticoagulants (4 RCTs, 4647 participants) 
Higher‐dose anticoagulants result in little or no difference in all‐cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.16, 4489 participants; 4 RCTs) and increase minor bleeding (RR 3.28, 95% CI 1.75 to 6.14, 1196 participants; 3 RCTs) compared to lower‐dose anticoagulants up to 30 days (high‐certainty evidence). Higher‐dose anticoagulants probably reduce pulmonary embolism (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.70, 4360 participants; 4 RCTs), and slightly increase major bleeding (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.80, 4400 participants; 4 RCTs) compared to lower‐dose anticoagulants up to 30 days (moderate‐certainty evidence). Higher‐dose anticoagulants may result in little or no difference in deep vein thrombosis (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.03, 3422 participants; 4 RCTs), stroke (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.03, 4349 participants; 3 RCTs), major adverse limb events (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.99, 1176 participants; 2 RCTs), myocardial infarction (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.55, 4349 participants; 3 RCTs), atrial fibrillation (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.70, 562 participants; 1 study), or thrombocytopenia (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.24, 2789 participants; 2 RCTs) compared to lower‐dose anticoagulants up to 30 days (low‐certainty evidence). It is unclear whether higher‐dose anticoagulants have any effect on necessity for additional respiratory support, mortality related to COVID‐19, and quality of life (very low‐certainty evidence or no data). 
Anticoagulants versus no treatment (3 prospective NRS, 11,538 participants) 
Anticoagulants may reduce all‐cause mortality but the evidence is very uncertain due to two study results being at critical and serious risk of bias (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.74, 8395 participants; 3 NRS; very low‐certainty evidence). It is uncertain if anticoagulants have any effect on necessity for additional respiratory support, mortality related to COVID‐19, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, major bleeding, stroke, myocardial infarction and quality of life (very low‐certainty evidence or no data). 
Ongoing studies 
We found 62 ongoing studies in hospital settings (60 RCTs, 35,470 participants; 2 prospective NRS, 120 participants) in 20 different countries. Thirty‐five ongoing studies plan to report mortality and 26 plan to report necessity for additional respiratory support. We expect 58 studies to be completed in December 2021, and four in July 2022. From 60 RCTs, 28 are comparing different doses of anticoagulants, 24 are comparing anticoagulants versus no anticoagulants, seven are comparing different types of anticoagulants, and one did not report detail of the comparator group. 
Authors' conclusions
When compared to a lower‐dose regimen, higher‐dose anticoagulants result in little to no difference in all‐cause mortality and increase minor bleeding in people hospitalised with COVID‐19 up to 30 days. Higher‐dose anticoagulants possibly reduce pulmonary embolism, slightly increase major bleeding, may result in little to no difference in hospitalisation time, and may result in little to no difference in deep vein thrombosis, stroke, major adverse limb events, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, or thrombocytopenia.  
Compared with no treatment, anticoagulants may reduce all‐cause mortality but the evidence comes from non‐randomised studies and is very uncertain. It is unclear whether anticoagulants have any effect on the remaining outcomes compared to no anticoagulants (very low‐certainty evidence or no data). 
Although we are very confident that new RCTs will not change the effects of different doses of anticoagulants on mortality and minor bleeding, high‐quality RCTs are still needed, mainly for the other primary outcome (necessity for additional respiratory support), the comparison with no anticoagulation, when comparing the types of anticoagulants and giving anticoagulants for a prolonged period of time.

Do Blood Thinners Help People in the Hospital with COVID-19?

### **Rationale**

COVID-19 is an illness that can make it hard for people to breathe. For some people, COVID-19 can also cause blood clots. Blood clots are clumps of blood that can form in the body. They can be very dangerous if they travel to the lungs, legs, or brain.

Doctors sometimes use medicines called blood thinners to stop clots from forming or to treat them. These medicines might also help reduce swelling in the body caused by the illness.

However, doctors were not sure if blood thinners were safe and helpful for people in the hospital with COVID-19. This study was done to see what the benefits and harms of using these medicines are for these patients.

### **Trial Design**

This was a review study. This means the researchers did not do a new experiment. Instead, they looked at the results from seven different studies that were already completed. This allowed them to combine information from many people to get a better answer.

The review included information from over 16,000 people. All of these people were in the hospital because they had COVID-19. Their average age was between 55 and 68 years old. After they were treated, doctors followed them for about one to three months to see how they were doing.

The studies compared different treatments. Some studies looked at giving a higher dose of blood thinners versus a lower dose. Other studies looked at giving blood thinners versus giving no blood thinners at all.

### **Results**

Here is what the researchers found when they combined the results from the different studies.

**Higher Doses vs. Lower Doses of Blood Thinners**

The researchers looked at what happened when people got a higher dose of blood thinners compared to a lower dose.

*   **Deaths:** The dose of blood thinners did not change the number of people who died from any cause. Researchers are very sure about this result.
*   **Bleeding:** People who got a higher dose had more minor bleeding, like nosebleeds. They also had a small increase in major bleeding. Major bleeding is more serious and may need a blood transfusion.
*   **Blood Clots:** The higher dose seemed to reduce the number of blood clots in the lungs. It did not seem to make a difference in blood clots in the legs or in the number of strokes.

**Blood Thinners vs. No Blood Thinners**

The researchers also looked at what happened when people got blood thinners compared to no treatment.

*   They found that blood thinners might lower the number of deaths. But the researchers are very unsure about this. The studies they looked at were not as strong.
*   It was not clear if blood thinners helped with other problems like breathing or blood clots for this group.

**What This Means**

For people in the hospital with COVID-19, using a higher dose of blood thinners does not seem to save more lives than a lower dose. Higher doses do increase the risk of bleeding. But they may prevent some blood clots in the lungs.

Researchers are still not sure if giving blood thinners is better than giving no blood thinners at all. More good studies are needed to answer this question and to find the best way to help people with COVID-19.","Do blood thinners prevent people who are hospitalised with COVID‐19 from developing blood clots? 
Key messages 
‐ High‐dose blood thinners result in little or no difference in death rate and increase minor bleeding compared to low‐dose blood thinners for people hospitalised with COVID‐19. Giving blood thinners compared to not giving blood thinners might reduce the death rate. 
‐ It is very likely that new studies will not change the evidence about the effects of different doses of blood thinners on death rate and minor bleeding. High‐quality studies are still needed to analyse the need for additional respiratory support, giving blood thinners compared to no blood thinners, comparing different blood thinners, and giving blood thinners for extended periods. 
What is COVID‐19? 
COVID‐19 typically affects the lungs and airways; however, in addition to respiratory problems, about 16% of people hospitalised with COVID‐19 experience problems with their blood vessels, leading to blood clots forming in the arteries, veins and lungs. Nearly half of all people with severe COVID‐19 in intensive care units develop clots in their veins or arteries. 
What are blood thinners? 
Blood thinners are medicines that prevent harmful blood clots from forming (deep vein thrombosis). However, they can cause unwanted effects such as bleeding. Some guidelines recommend giving blood thinners when people are first admitted to hospital with COVID‐19 to prevent blood clots from developing, rather than waiting to see whether blood clots develop and then treating them with blood thinners. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether giving blood thinners to people hospitalised with COVID‐19 as a preventive measure reduced the number of deaths compared to people who received no treatment or those who received a placebo treatment (an identical‐seeming treatment but with no active ingredient). We also wanted to determine whether these individuals needed less support with breathing, whether they still developed harmful blood clots, whether they experienced bleeding and whether they experienced any other unwanted events. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed blood thinners given to people hospitalised with COVID‐19 to prevent blood clots. Studies could be of any design as long as they compared a blood thinner with another blood thinner, no treatment or a placebo. Studies could take place anywhere in the world and participants could be any age as long as they were in hospital with confirmed COVID‐19 disease. We pooled the results when appropriate. 
What did we find? 
We included seven studies with 16,185 people hospitalised with COVID‐19 in either intensive care units, hospital wards or emergency departments. Studies were from Brazil (2), Iran (1), Italy (1), and the USA (1), and two involved more than country. People in the studies were aged from 55 to 68 years on average. Studies lasted from 15 to 90 days and provided evidence on deaths, bleeding, blood clotting, length of hospital stay and unwanted effects. There was little or no evidence on need for respiratory support (help with breathing), deaths related to COVID‐19, and quality of life. 
Higher‐dose of blood thinners compared with lower‐dose (4 studies, 4647 people)  In people who received higher compared to lower doses of blood thinners there was little to no difference in death rate. However, people on higher doses were more likely to experience minor bleeding compared to in those on lower doses. People who received higher doses of blood thinners likely had reduced pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung or blood vessel leading to the lung), slightly increased major (more severe) bleeding, and probably had little to no difference in time spent in hospital compared to those who received the lower doses of blood thinners. In people who received higher doses of blood thinners, there was little to no difference in the rate of deep vein thrombosis, and other unwanted events compared to those who received the lower dose of blood thinners. 
Blood thinners compared with no treatment (3 studies, 11,538 people)  People who received blood thinners had a reduced death rate compared to those who did not receive blood thinners, but the evidence is very uncertain. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We are very confident that higher doses of blood thinners do not change the risk of death but do increase the risk of bleeding in people hospitalised with COVID‐19. 
Although our confidence in the evidence is very limited, people who receive blood thinners may have a lower death rate compared to those who did not receive any blood thinners. 
What happens next? 
Our searches found 62 ongoing studies with 35,470 people. We plan to add the results of these studies to our review when they are published. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to 14 April 2021.

Delayed recovery of urinary continence is a major adverse effect of robotic‐assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) in men undergoing prostate cancer treatment. To address this issue, a number of surgical techniques have been designed to reconstruct the posterior aspect of the rhabdosphincter, which is responsible for urinary continence after removal of the prostate; however, it is unclear how well they work.  
Objectives
To assess the effects of posterior musculofascial reconstruction RALP compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP for the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer. 
Search methods
We performed a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, trials registries, other sources of the grey literature, and conference proceedings, up to 12 March 2021. We applied no restrictions on publication language or status. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which participants were randomized to undergo variations of posterior musculofascial reconstruction RALP versus no posterior reconstruction during RALP for clinically localized prostate cancer. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. Primary outcomes were: urinary continence recovery within one week after catheter removal, at three months after surgery, and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were: urinary continence recovery at six and twelve months after surgery, potency recovery twelve months after surgery, positive surgical margins (PSM), and biochemical recurrence‐free survival (BCRFS). We performed statistical analyses using a random‐effects model. We rated the certainty of evidence (CoE) according to the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Our search identified 13 records of eight unique RCTs, of which six were published studies and two were abstract proceedings. We included 1085 randomized participants, of whom 963 completed the trials (88.8%). All participants had either cT1c or cT2 or cT3a disease, with a mean prostate‐specific antigen level of 8.15 ng/mL. 
Primary outcomes 
Posterior reconstruction RALP (PR‐RALP) may improve urinary continence one week after catheter removal compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.73; I2 = 42%; studies = 5, participants = 498; low CoE) although the CI also includes the possibility of no effect. Assuming 335 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP are continent at this time point, this corresponds to 84 more men per 1000 (33 fewer to 244 more) reporting urinary continence recovery.  
Posterior reconstruction may have little to no effect on urinary continence three months after surgery compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.14; I2 = 67%; studies = 6, participants = 842; low CoE). Assuming 701 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP are continent at this time point, this corresponds to 14 fewer men per 1000 (112 fewer to 98 more) reporting urinary continence after three months. 
PR‐RALP probably results in little to no difference in serious adverse events compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.92; I2 = 0%; studies = 6, participants = 835; moderate CoE). Assuming 25 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP experience a serious adverse event at this time point, this corresponds to six fewer men per 1000 (17 fewer to 23 more) reporting serious adverse events.  
Secondary outcomes 
PR‐RALP may result in little to no difference in recovery of continence 12 months after surgery compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.07; I2 = 25%; studies = 3, participants = 602; low CoE). Assuming 918 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP are continent at this time point, this corresponds to 18 more men per 1000 (18 fewer to 64 more) reporting urinary continence recovery.  
We are very uncertain about the effects of PR‐RALP on recovery of potency 12 months after surgery compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.26; I2 = 3%; studies = 2, participants = 308; very low CoE). Assuming 433 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP are potent at this time point, this corresponds to nine more men per 1000 (78 fewer to 113 more) reporting potency recovery.  
PR‐RALP may result in little to no difference in positive surgical margins compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.33; I2 = 50%; studies = 3, participants = 517; low CoE). Assuming 130 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP have a positive surgical margin, this corresponds to 31 more men per 1000 (46 fewer to 173 more) reporting positive surgical margins.  
PR‐RALP may result in little to no difference in biochemical recurrence compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.52; I2 = 0%; studies = 2, participants = 468; low CoE). Assuming 70 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP have experienced biochemical recurrence at this time point, this corresponds to 25 more men per 1000 (18 fewer to 107 more) reporting biochemical recurrence.  
Authors' conclusions
This review found evidence that PR‐RALP may improve early continence one week after catheter removal but not thereafter. Meanwhile, adverse event rates are probably not impacted and surgical margins rates are likely similar. This review was unable to determine if or how these findings may be impacted by the person's age, nerve‐sparing status, or clinical stage. Study limitations, imprecision, and inconsistency lowered the certainty of evidence for the outcomes assessed.

A Special Surgery to Help with Bladder Control After Prostate Cancer Treatment

***

### **Rationale**

Some men with prostate cancer have surgery to remove their prostate gland. This is a common treatment for cancer that has not spread. After the surgery, many men have trouble controlling their bladder. This can mean they leak urine when they do not want to. This can be a big problem in their daily lives.

Doctors have a new way to do this surgery. It involves rebuilding the main muscle that helps control the flow of urine. The goal of this new technique is to help men get their bladder control back faster.

This study was done to find out if this new surgery is better than the standard surgery. Researchers wanted to see if it really helped men control their bladder sooner. They also wanted to make sure it was just as safe.

***

### **Trial Design**

This paper did not do a new study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of 8 different studies that were already completed. This helps get a stronger answer by combining information from many people.

In these studies, over 1000 men with prostate cancer were split into two groups by chance, like flipping a coin.

*   One group had the standard surgery to remove the prostate.
*   The other group had the new surgery. This surgery also removed the prostate but included the extra step of rebuilding the urine control muscle.

Researchers in the original studies checked on the men for up to one year after their surgery. They looked at how well the men could control their bladder. They also checked for any serious problems or side effects.

***

### **Results**

Here is what the researchers found when they combined the results from all the studies.

**Bladder Control**

*   The new surgery may help men get bladder control back a little faster. In the first week after surgery, about 84 more men out of 1000 had full bladder control with the new surgery.
*   But this benefit did not last long. After three months, there was no real difference in bladder control between the two groups.
*   After one year, the number of men with good bladder control was about the same in both groups.

**Safety and Other Effects**

*   The new surgery was just as safe as the standard one. The number of men who had serious problems was very low in both groups.
*   The new surgery did not seem to make a difference in getting erections back after one year.
*   The chance of the cancer coming back was also about the same for both types of surgery.

**What this means**

The doctors who did this review concluded that the new surgery technique may help men control their bladder in the first week after the operation. However, it does not seem to make a difference in the long run. The new surgery is likely just as safe as the standard surgery.

The researchers also said that the proof from these studies was not very strong. More research could help us be more sure about the good and bad effects of this new surgery technique.","Should we perform posterior reconstruction RALP or standard RALP for clinically localized prostate cancer? 
Review question 
In men with prostate cancer who are having their prostate removed using surgery assisted by a robotic device (called robotic‐assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy, or RALP), how does connecting the tissue behind the urethra (so‐called posterior reconstruction) compare to surgery where these connections are not made (standard RALP)? 
Background 
Urologists often use a robot to remove the prostate in men with prostate cancer. After surgery, most men leak urine for some time. This problem is called incontinence and usually improves six to 12 months after surgery in most men. However, it can be very bothersome during this time. 
Study characteristics 
We included eight studies in which chance determined whether men had posterior reconstruction RALP or standard RALP. These studies included 1085 men with an average age ranging from 60 to 67 years. The average prostate‐specific antigen (PSA) level in the men was 8.15 ng/mL. Higher levels of PSA may indicate worse prostate cancer. 
Key results 
We found that posterior reconstruction RALP may result in better continence one week after the catheter comes out compared to standard RALP (although it is also possible that it is no better), but it may make little to no difference at either three or 12 months after surgery. Posterior reconstruction RALP probably results in little to no difference in serious unwanted effects compared with the standard way of doing the surgery. There may also be little to no difference in positive surgical margins, meaning the risk of there being cancer cells right at the cut edge of the prostate when viewed under the microscope. There may also be no difference between the two techniques in terms of the risk of a PSA level that goes up within 12 months of surgery, which often signals that there is cancer left behind. We are very uncertain how posterior reconstruction RALP effects the ability to achieve an erection, compared to standard RALP. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low depending on the outcome, meaning that we have moderate to very little confidence in the results.

10.1002-14651858.CD013491.pub2,"Background
Relapse (the re‐emergence of depressive symptoms after some level of improvement but preceding recovery) and recurrence (onset of a new depressive episode after recovery) are common in depression, lead to worse outcomes and quality of life for patients and exert a high economic cost on society. Outcomes can be predicted by using multivariable prognostic models, which use information about several predictors to produce an individualised risk estimate. The ability to accurately predict relapse or recurrence while patients are well (in remission) would allow the identification of high‐risk individuals and may improve overall treatment outcomes for patients by enabling more efficient allocation of interventions to prevent relapse and recurrence. 
Objectives
To summarise the predictive performance of prognostic models developed to predict the risk of relapse, recurrence, sustained remission or recovery in adults with major depressive disorder who meet criteria for remission or recovery. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library (current issue); Ovid MEDLINE (1946 onwards); Ovid Embase (1980 onwards); Ovid PsycINFO (1806 onwards); and Web of Science (1900 onwards) up to May 2020. We also searched sources of grey literature, screened the reference lists of included studies and performed a forward citation search. There were no restrictions applied to the searches by date, language or publication status . 
Selection criteria
We included development and external validation (testing model performance in data separate from the development data) studies of any multivariable prognostic models (including two or more predictors) to predict relapse, recurrence, sustained remission, or recovery in adults (aged 18 years and over) with remitted depression, in any clinical setting. We included all study designs and accepted all definitions of relapse, recurrence and other related outcomes. We did not specify a comparator prognostic model. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened references; extracted data (using a template based on the CHecklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modelling Studies (CHARMS)); and assessed risks of bias of included studies (using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST)). We referred any disagreements to a third independent review author. Where we found sufficient (10 or more) external validation studies of an individual model, we planned to perform a meta‐analysis of its predictive performance, specifically with respect to its calibration (how well the predicted probabilities match the observed proportions of individuals that experience the outcome) and discrimination (the ability of the model to differentiate between those with and without the outcome). Recommendations could not be qualified using the GRADE system, as guidance is not yet available for prognostic model reviews. 
Main results
We identified 11 eligible prognostic model studies (10 unique prognostic models). Seven were model development studies; three were model development and external validation studies; and one was an external validation‐only study. Multiple estimates of performance measures were not available for any of the models and, meta‐analysis was therefore not possible. Ten out of the 11 included studies were assessed as being at high overall risk of bias. Common weaknesses included insufficient sample size, inappropriate handling of missing data and lack of information about discrimination and calibration. One paper (Klein 2018) was at low overall risk of bias and presented a prognostic model including the following predictors: number of previous depressive episodes, residual depressive symptoms and severity of the last depressive episode. The external predictive performance of this model was poor (C‐statistic 0.59; calibration slope 0.56; confidence intervals not reported). None of the identified studies examined the clinical utility (net benefit) of the developed model. 
Authors' conclusions
Of the 10 prognostic models identified (across 11 studies), only four underwent external validation. Most of the studies (n = 10) were assessed as being at high overall risk of bias, and the one study that was at low risk of bias presented a model with poor predictive performance. There is a need for improved prognostic research in this clinical area, with future studies conforming to current best practice recommendations for prognostic model development/validation and reporting findings in line with the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement.

Can We Predict if a Person’s Depression Will Come Back?

**Rationale**

Depression is a common illness. It can make you feel very sad, tired, and lose interest in life. It can make it hard to enjoy the things you used to love. Many people get treatment for depression and start to feel better.

However, sometimes after a person feels well again, their depression returns. When this happens, it is called a ""relapse"" or ""recurrence."" This can be very difficult and upsetting for people. It affects their quality of life and well-being. This cycle also creates a large cost for families and for society as a whole.

Doctors want to help people with depression stay well for a long time. One way to do this could be to guess who is more likely to have their depression come back. If doctors could predict this, they could offer extra support to the people who need it most. This could include more therapy or other treatments to help stop the depression from returning.

Some researchers have tried to create special tools to make these predictions. These tools are often called ""prognostic models."" They use information about a person, like their health history, to estimate their future risk.

This study was done to find all the prediction tools that have been created so far. The researchers wanted to look closely at the studies on these tools. Their main goal was to see if any of these tools work well enough for doctors to use to help patients.

**Trial Design**

This was a special kind of study called a review. The researchers did not work with any new patients. Instead, they looked for all the studies that had already been completed on this topic. Think of it like a detective gathering all the clues from past cases to solve a bigger mystery.

The research team searched for studies that created or tested a prediction tool. The tools had to be designed to predict the return of depression. The studies they looked for had to include adults who had depression in the past but were feeling better at the time of the study.

The team searched for studies from all over the world, in any language. Their search included studies published up until May 2020. This helped them get a full picture of all the research that had been done.

It is very important to know if a study was done well. A study with flaws can give the wrong answers. So, two people on the research team carefully checked the quality of every study they found. They looked for problems that could make the results untrustworthy. This is called checking for ""risk of bias.""

**Results**

The researchers found 11 studies in total. These studies described 10 different tools made to predict if depression would come back.

The team found that most of these tools were not tested enough. To know if a tool really works, it should be tested on a new group of people. This test shows if the tool works for more than just the people it was first made for. Only 4 of the 10 tools had this important extra testing.

The researchers also found that most of the studies had serious problems. They decided that 10 out of the 11 studies had a high risk of having wrong results. These problems included things like having too few people in the study. This is like trying to guess what a whole country thinks by only asking a few people. You might get the wrong answer.

Only one study was done very well and had a low risk of being wrong. This study tested a tool that used three pieces of information to make a guess. It looked at:
*   The number of times a person had depression before.
*   If any small signs of depression were still there.
*   How bad the person’s last depression was.

Even though this study was done well, its prediction tool did not work well. The tool was poor at guessing who would have their depression come back. Its guesses were not much better than chance, like flipping a coin. This means it would not be a useful tool for doctors or patients.

Finally, the researchers concluded that there are no good tools right now to predict if depression will come back. Most of the tools that exist have not been tested well. The one tool that was studied well did not work. This is important to know. It shows that we need much more research in this area. Scientists need to do new studies that are larger and better designed. The goal is to create a tool that is accurate and truly helpful. A good tool could one day help doctors give the right care to the right person. This could help more people stay well and avoid having their depression return.","Predicting relapse or recurrence of depression
What is the aim of this review? 
Relapse and recurrence (becoming unwell again after making an improvement) are common in depression and lead to increased disability and decreased quality of life for patients. Relapse is a re‐emergence of the initial episode of depression after some initial improvement, whereas recurrence is the onset of a new episode of depression after recovery. Outcomes, such as relapse and recurrence, can sometimes be predicted while people are well, using information available at the time. A mathematical calculation can be performed to assess an individual person's risk; this calculation is known as a 'prognostic model' or a prediction tool. In most health services, including the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK, resources such as doctors and therapists need to be used in the best way possible, for the people who will gain the most benefit from them. If accurate prediction tools are available, the information can be used to identify the most 'high risk' patients and make sure they receive additional support to try to prevent a relapse or a recurrence. 
The aim of this review was to identify studies that have attempted to develop a prediction tool for relapse or recurrence of depression in adults. We were interested in studies that had attempted to make this prediction while patients were well. We also included tools that predicted the chance of patients staying well. If we had found multiple studies that tested the same prediction tool, we planned to combine these to work out a better summary of how well that tool worked. 
Key messages 
We identified 10 prediction tools (over 11 studies) for relapse or recurrence. These were either not proven to be good at predicting relapse/recurrence, or the studies had problems with how they were carried out, meaning that none of the prediction tools were at a stage where they could be used in the real world. Further work is needed to improve prediction of relapse or recurrence of depression. 
What was studied in the review? 
We collected and analysed the results of 11 relevant studies. We were interested in several things: how researchers had defined relapse and recurrence (for example, whether they had used clinical interviews or self‐report questionnaires to diagnose depressive symptoms); what information was gathered to help make predictions; the techniques used by the researchers to help develop the tools; and how well the tools predicted. We were also interested in whether the tools were tested in a separate group of participants, which is essential to ensure that the model can predict accurately in patients in the real world. 
Finally, we assessed the studies to determine how confident we could be in the results, given the approaches taken by researchers (this is called 'risk of bias') and how relevant the studies were to our review (this is called 'applicability'). 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found 11 studies. Ten of these developed different models and one study tested one of the models developed in a previous study. It was not possible to combine results for any particular tool. 
Ten of the 11 studies were rated at high risk of bias. This means that we cannot be confident in the results that were presented, due to some issues with the way the studies were conducted. The most common issue was that there were not enough participants included in the studies. Other common problems involved the statistical approaches used by the researchers. 
One study was at low overall risk of bias, which means that we can be more confident in trusting the results. However, this tool did not make accurate predictions about relapse or recurrence. 
We found no studies that could be used in clinical practice; further work is needed to develop tools for predicting relapse or recurrence of depression. 
How up‐to‐date is the review? 
The literature search for this review was completed in May 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD009949.pub2,"Aspiration of the elbow joint for treating radial head fractures
What is a radial head fracture? 
The radial head is the topmost part of the radius, which is one of the two forearm bones. The radial head is part of the elbow joint. Fracture or breaking of the radial head is the most common elbow fracture. This injury usually results from a fall onto an outstretched arm. The symptoms of a radial head fracture are pain, swelling and bruising around the elbow, as well as restricted movement. 
What is aspiration? 
One treatment for radial head fracture is aspiration. This is a procedure where a sterile needle and syringe are used to drain excess fluid and blood from the elbow joint to relieve pressure and thus, in theory, relieve pain and improve clinical outcome. However, aspiration is an invasive procedure that puts the patient at further risk of complications, such as infection and injury to nerves and vessels. The procedure is typically done in the first few days after injury. 
Aim of the review 
We aimed to assess the effects (benefits and harms) of aspiration of the elbow joint for treating radial head fracture in adults. 
Description of the studies included in the review  We searched the medical literature up to April 2014 and found two relevant studies that reported results for a total of 108 people with radial head fractures. Most participants were adults, aged 30 or over. They generally had less serious fractures and were all treated without surgery. The two studies were small, poorly reported and at high risk of bias. Neither study used reliable measures to assess function or pain. Consequently, we are very unsure of the findings of these trials. 
Summary of the evidence 
Very low quality evidence showed little difference between those who had joint aspiration and those who did not in being unable to carry heavy loads or having discomfort when carrying loads using their previously injured arm at one year after injury. Very low quality evidence shows that aspiration often provides immediate pain relief and may still provide pain relief at three weeks. Neither trial reported on adverse events from the procedure, but aspiration was reported as being unsuccessful in three participants of one study. Very low quality evidence shows little effect of aspiration on being able to extend the elbow at either six weeks or one year. The reporting of adverse events was incomplete, but one trial reported the absence of three common complications of radial head fractures. 
Conclusions 
Overall, there is not enough evidence to say whether aspiration gives better short‐term or longer‐term results than no aspiration in treating radial head fractures or how safe it is. We suggest that further research is needed to examine the use of aspiration for the initial treatment of radial head fractures.

Does Draining Fluid from the Elbow Help Heal a Common Type of Break?

### **Rationale**

**What is a broken radial head?**

Your forearm has two bones that run from your elbow to your wrist. One of these bones is called the radius. The very top part of this bone, right at your elbow joint, is called the radial head.

Sometimes, people break this bone. This is called a radial head fracture. It is the most common type of elbow break. It often happens when someone falls onto their straight, outstretched arm. When this bone breaks, it can cause pain, swelling, and bruising around the elbow. It can also make it hard to move your elbow.

**What did this study look at?**

When a bone breaks near a joint, fluid and blood can build up. This can cause pressure and pain. One way to treat this is a procedure called aspiration. Aspiration is when a doctor uses a clean needle to drain the extra fluid and blood from the joint. In theory, this should help with pain and healing.

However, aspiration has risks. Because a needle enters the body, there is a chance of getting an infection. It could also harm nerves or blood vessels near the elbow. Doctors wanted to know if the good things about aspiration are worth these risks.

This review looked at past studies. The main goal was to see if aspiration is a safe and helpful treatment for a broken radial head. The researchers wanted to find out if it really helps people feel better and heal faster.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, the researchers reviewed studies that were already done. They looked for all the medical studies they could find on this topic up to April 2014. This helps get a bigger picture of what we know.

The researchers found two studies to review. In total, these two studies included 108 people with a broken radial head. Most of the people in the studies were adults who were 30 years old or older. Their elbow breaks were not very serious, and none of them needed surgery to fix the bone.

In these studies, some people had their elbow drained with a needle. Other people did not have this done. The studies then watched the patients for up to one year to see how they healed.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The researchers found that the two studies they reviewed were small. They were also not done in a way that gives clear answers. This means the proof from these studies is of very low quality. Because the proof is not strong, we cannot be very sure about the results.

Here is what the low-quality proof showed:

*   **Pain:** Draining the elbow often gave people pain relief right away. It may have also helped with pain for up to three weeks after the injury.
*   **Elbow Use:** After one year, there was not much difference between the two groups. People who had their elbows drained were not any better at carrying heavy things.
*   **Elbow Movement:** There was also very little difference in how well people could straighten their elbows. This was true at six weeks and at one year after the injury.
*   **Side Effects:** The studies did not give much information about side effects. In one study, the draining procedure did not work for three people. The studies did not report if people got infections or had other problems from the needle.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

Based on this review, there is not enough good proof to make a decision. We cannot say for sure if draining the elbow is helpful or harmful for this type of break. We do not know if it gives better results than not doing the procedure. We also do not know how safe it really is.

The researchers believe that new and better studies are needed. Future studies could help us learn if aspiration is a good treatment for people with a broken radial head.","Aspiration of the elbow joint for treating radial head fractures

Remote cognitive assessments are increasingly needed to assist in the detection of cognitive disorders, but the diagnostic accuracy of telephone‐ and video‐based cognitive screening remains unclear. 
Objectives
To assess the test accuracy of any multidomain cognitive test delivered remotely for the diagnosis of any form of dementia. 
To assess for potential differences in cognitive test scoring when using a remote platform, and where a remote screener was compared to the equivalent face‐to‐face test. 
Search methods
We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov/) databases on 2 June 2021. We performed forward and backward searching of included citations. 
Selection criteria
We included cross‐sectional studies, where a remote, multidomain assessment was administered alongside a clinical diagnosis of dementia or equivalent face‐to‐face test. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data; a third review author moderated disagreements. Our primary analysis was the accuracy of remote assessments against a clinical diagnosis of dementia. Where data were available, we reported test accuracy as sensitivity and specificity. We did not perform quantitative meta‐analysis as there were too few studies at individual test level. 
For those studies comparing remote versus in‐person use of an equivalent screening test, if data allowed, we described correlations, reliability, differences in scores and the proportion classified as having cognitive impairment for each test. 
Main results
The review contains 31 studies (19 differing tests, 3075 participants), of which seven studies (six telephone, one video call, 756 participants) were relevant to our primary objective of describing test accuracy against a clinical diagnosis of dementia. All studies were at unclear or high risk of bias in at least one domain, but were low risk in applicability to the review question. Overall, sensitivity of remote tools varied with values between 26% and 100%, and specificity between 65% and 100%, with no clearly superior test. 
Across the 24 papers comparing equivalent remote and in‐person tests (14 telephone, 10 video call), agreement between tests was good, but rarely perfect (correlation coefficient range: 0.48 to 0.98). 
Authors' conclusions
Despite the common and increasing use of remote cognitive assessment, supporting evidence on test accuracy is limited. Available data do not allow us to suggest a preferred test. Remote testing is complex, and this is reflected in the heterogeneity seen in tests used, their application, and their analysis. More research is needed to describe accuracy of contemporary approaches to remote cognitive assessment. While data comparing remote and in‐person use of a test were reassuring, thresholds and scoring rules derived from in‐person testing may not be applicable when the equivalent test is adapted for remote use.

Checking How Well Thinking and Memory Tests Work Over the Phone or by Video Call

### **Rationale**

**What are problems with thinking and memory?**

As people get older, some may have problems with their memory or thinking. This can make it hard to remember things, make choices, or do daily tasks. When these problems are serious, doctors may call it dementia. It is important to find these problems early.

**Why did we do this study?**

It can be hard for some people to go to a doctor's office for a check-up. So, doctors and nurses have started to use phone calls or video calls to give tests for thinking and memory. These are called remote tests.

We are not sure if these remote tests work as well as tests done in person. We wanted to find out how good these tests are at finding people who may have dementia. This study looked at past research to see what it says about these remote tests.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, our team looked at the results of many studies that were already finished. This is called a review. We searched for all studies that looked at remote tests for thinking and memory problems.

We looked for two types of studies. The first type compared a remote test to a full check-up and diagnosis by a doctor. The second type compared a remote test to the same test given face-to-face in a clinic.

Our review included 31 different studies. In total, these studies had more than 3,000 people in them. Because this was a review of past studies, no new patients were asked to join or spend any time in a trial.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of this study?**

Our review found that there is not enough proof to say for sure how well remote tests work. The results from the studies we looked at were very different from each other.

When the remote tests were compared to a doctor’s diagnosis, the results were mixed.
*   Some tests were not very good at finding people who had dementia. One test only found about 3 out of 10 people who had it. Other tests did much better and found all 10 people who had it.
*   The tests were a bit better at finding people who did not have dementia. Most tests correctly found between 7 and 10 out of 10 people who did not have it.
*   Because the results were so different, we could not say that one remote test was better than the others.

When remote tests were compared to the same tests done in person, the scores were often close. But the scores were not a perfect match. This means a person might get a slightly different score on a test over the phone than they would in person.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

There is not enough good information to know which remote tests for thinking and memory are best. We need more and better research on this topic.

The way tests are scored when you take them in a doctor’s office might not be the right way to score them when they are done over a phone or video call. New rules may be needed for remote tests to make sure they are accurate. For now, doctors should be careful when using these remote tests to check for serious memory problems like dementia.","How accurate are remote, virtual assessments at diagnosing dementia?
Why is this question important? 
Dementia is a chronic and progressive condition that affects peoples' memory and ability to function day‐to‐day. A clinical diagnosis of dementia usually involves brain scans, physical examinations and history taking. As a first step, we often use memory and thinking tests to identify people who need further assessment. Traditionally these tests are performed in‐person, but modifications of the tests allow them to be used over the telephone or via video calls – sometimes called 'remote assessment'. 
The need for remote assessment has become particularly urgent due to COVID‐19. However, there are potential benefits of remote assessment beyond the COVID‐19 pandemic. Physically attending appointments can be difficult for some people and remote assessments offer greater convenience. Remote assessments are also useful in research, as a large number of people can be reached in a fairly short amount of time. 
A test delivered by telephone may not be as good as the in‐person equivalent, and getting these tests right is important. One the one hand, If a test suggests someone has dementia when they do not (called a false positive), this can have an emotional impact on the person and their family. On the other hand, not identifying memory and thinking problems when they are present (called a false negative), mean that the person does not get the treatment and support that they need. 
What was the aim of this review? 
We aimed to assess whether memory and thinking tests carried out by telephone or video call can detect dementia. 
What was studied in this review? 
We looked at various memory and thinking tests. Many tests have been developed over time and they differ in their content and application, but most are based on a modification of a traditional in‐person test. 
What were the main results of this review? 
The review included 31 studies, using 19 different memory tests, with a total of 3075 participants. 
Only seven tests were relevant to our question regarding accuracy of remote testing. With the limited number of studies, estimates on the accuracy of these tests are imprecise. Our review suggests that remote tests could correctly identify people with dementia between 26% and 100% of the time, and could correctly rule out dementia 65% to 100% of the time. 
The remaining 24 studies compared a remote test with the face‐to‐face equivalent. These studies suggested that remote test scores usually agreed with in‐person testing, but this was not perfect. 
How reliable are the results of the studies in this review? 
In these studies, a clinical diagnosis of dementia was used as the reference (gold) standard. We identified a number of issues in the design, conduct and reporting of the studies. A particular issue was around the selection of participants for the studies. Studies often did not include people with hearing or language impairments that may have complicated remote testing. 
Who do the results of this study apply to? 
Most studies investigated older adults (over 65 years). The findings may not be representative of all older adults with dementia, as some studies only examined specific groups of people, for example, after stroke. The studies were usually performed in specialist centres by experts. So, we do not know how well these tests identify dementia in routine community practice. 
What are the implications of this review? 
The review highlights the lack of high‐quality research describing accuracy of telephone‐ and video call‐based memory and thinking tests. There were many differences between the studies included in this review such as the type of test used, participants included, the setting in which the study is carried out and language studied. This made comparisons between studies difficult. Our review suggests that remote assessments and in‐person assessments are not always equivalent. In situations where access to in‐person assessment is difficult, remote testing could be used as a useful first step. Ideally, this should be followed up with an in‐person assessment before a diagnosis is made. Due to limited studies, and differences in the way studies were carried out, we cannot recommend one particular remote test for the assessment of dementia.

10.1002-14651858.CD012129.pub3,"Aspirin (single dose) for relief of perineal pain after childbirth
What is the issue? 
Can aspirin be given to women who experience perineal pain following childbirth to relieve the pain, without causing side effects for either the women or their babies? 
Why is this important? 
Many women experience pain in the perineum (the area between the vagina and anus) following childbirth. The perineum may be bruised or torn during childbirth, or have a cut made to help the baby to be born (an episiotomy). After childbirth, perineal pain can interfere with women's ability to care for their newborns and establish breastfeeding. If perineal pain is not relieved effectively, longer‐term problems for women may include painful sexual intercourse, pelvic floor problems resulting in incontinence, prolapse, or chronic perineal pain. Aspirin may be given to women who have perineal pain after childbirth, but its effectiveness and safety had not been assessed in a systematic review. This is an update of a review last published in 2017. This is part of a series of reviews looking at drugs to help relieve perineal pain in first few weeks after childbirth. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence in October 2019, and included 17 randomised controlled studies, involving 1132 women, published between 1967 and 1997. All women had perineal pain following an episiotomy (usually within 48 hours after birth), and were not breastfeeding. The women received either aspirin (doses ranging from 300 mg to 1200 mg) or fake pills (placebo), by mouth. The methodological quality of the studies was often unclear.

Can Aspirin Help with Pain After Giving Birth?

### **Rationale**

Many women have pain after giving birth. This pain is often in the area between the vagina and the anus. This area is called the perineum. During childbirth, the skin of the perineum can stretch, tear, or be cut by a doctor to help the baby be born. This can cause pain, soreness, and bruising after the baby arrives.

This pain can make it hard for a new mother to live her daily life. It can be difficult to sit, walk, or go to the bathroom. The pain can also make it harder to care for a new baby and to start breastfeeding. If the pain is not treated well, it can sometimes lead to long-term problems. These problems might include pain during sex or trouble controlling pee.

Researchers wanted to know if a common pain medicine, aspirin, could help with this pain. They wanted to see if a single dose of aspirin could ease the pain for new mothers. It was also very important to learn if aspirin was safe for both the mother and her baby. This review was done because there was not a clear answer on how well aspirin works for this kind of pain.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study where doctors gave medicine to new patients. Instead, researchers looked for all the studies that had already been done on this topic. They gathered all the information from these past studies and looked at it together. This helps give a stronger, more complete answer.

The researchers found 17 older studies to look at. These studies included over 1,000 women. All the women in the studies had pain from a cut made during childbirth. The studies were done between the years 1967 and 1997. It is important to know that none of the women in these studies were breastfeeding their babies.

In the studies, women were put into groups by chance. One group of women took a single dose of aspirin by mouth. The other group of women took a fake pill, also called a placebo. A placebo is a pill that looks real but has no medicine in it. This helps researchers know for sure if the real medicine is what caused any changes. Doctors then checked on the women 4 to 8 hours after they took the pill to see if their pain was better.

### **Results**

The researchers found that a single dose of aspirin may help with pain after childbirth. Women who took aspirin were more likely to say their pain was better after 4 to 8 hours compared to women who took the fake pill. However, the researchers were not very sure about this finding. The proof from the old studies was not very strong.

The review also looked at other questions, but the answers were even less clear. It was uncertain if taking aspirin meant that women needed fewer other pain pills. It was also not clear if aspirin caused any bad side effects for the mothers. The proof for these things was very weak. The studies did not give enough information to be sure.

There were many important things that the studies did not look at. None of the studies reported on any side effects for the babies. They also did not report if the pain caused women to stay in the hospital longer. The studies did not look at long-term pain or how women felt about the treatment.

In conclusion, aspirin may help relieve pain for a few hours after childbirth for women who are not breastfeeding. But we need more and better research to be sure. We have no information from this review about whether aspirin is safe or helpful for mothers who are breastfeeding.","Aspirin (single dose) for relief of perineal pain after childbirth
What is the issue? 
Can aspirin be given to women who experience perineal pain following childbirth to relieve the pain, without causing side effects for either the women or their babies? 
Why is this important? 
Many women experience pain in the perineum (the area between the vagina and anus) following childbirth. The perineum may be bruised or torn during childbirth, or have a cut made to help the baby to be born (an episiotomy). After childbirth, perineal pain can interfere with women's ability to care for their newborns and establish breastfeeding. If perineal pain is not relieved effectively, longer‐term problems for women may include painful sexual intercourse, pelvic floor problems resulting in incontinence, prolapse, or chronic perineal pain. Aspirin may be given to women who have perineal pain after childbirth, but its effectiveness and safety had not been assessed in a systematic review. This is an update of a review last published in 2017. This is part of a series of reviews looking at drugs to help relieve perineal pain in first few weeks after childbirth. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence in October 2019, and included 17 randomised controlled studies, involving 1132 women, published between 1967 and 1997. All women had perineal pain following an episiotomy (usually within 48 hours after birth), and were not breastfeeding. The women received either aspirin (doses ranging from 300 mg to 1200 mg) or fake pills (placebo), by mouth. The methodological quality of the studies was often unclear. Two studies did not contribute any data for analyses. 
Aspirin compared with placebo may increase adequate pain relief for mothers four to eight hours after administration (low‐certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether aspirin compared with placebo has an effect on the need for additional pain relief, or on adverse effects for mothers, in the four to eight hours after administration (both very low‐certainty evidence). 
The effects of administering 300 mg versus 600 mg aspirin (1 study), 600 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin (2 studies), or 300 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin (1 study) are uncertain for adequate pain relief, the need for additional pain relief, or adverse effects for the mother. 
No studies reported on adverse effects of aspirin for the baby, or other outcomes we planned to assess: prolonged hospital stay, or readmission to hospital due to perineal pain; perineal pain six weeks after childbirth, women's views, or postpartum depression.

An arteriovenous access consists of a direct surgical connection between an artery and a vein in the arm (fistula) or a plastic conduit connecting an artery and a vein (graft). If these forms of access become dysfunctional the delivery of dialysis therapy becomes suboptimal. The most common cause of access dysfunction is the development of a restriction or conduit narrowing called 'stenosis'. Because early correction of stenosis is considered critical to maintain the patency (openness) of the access and prolong its use, guidelines recommend regular surveillance of the access (i.e. screening based on diagnostic tests) in addition to or instead of a physical exam (clinical monitoring) to identify and treat early lesions. 
In this review we included 14 studies, randomising 1390 participants to either a pre‐emptive correction of an access stenosis (i.e. before the access became dysfunctional) or a deferred correction of an access stenosis (i.e. if and when the access became dysfunctional). This review shows that pre‐emptive correction of an arteriovenous access stenosis does not improve longevity of the access overall. In people using grafts pre‐emptive correction does not reduce the risk of thrombosis or access loss. In people using fistulas pre‐emptive stenosis correction reduces the risk of thrombosis and may prolong the longevity of the access. However, this surveillance and pre‐emptive correction strategy may increase the number of access‐related procedures and procedure‐related adverse events. 
This systematic review presents, to clinicians and patients, evidence‐based data that do not support the use of access surveillance and pre‐emptive correction of stenosis in grafts. Although surveillance and pre‐emptive correction of stenosis reduce the risk of thrombosis and may reduce the risk of access loss in fistulas, they may also increase the risk of procedure‐related adverse events and health‐care cost. Large multicentre clinical trials are necessary in this patient population to better clarify potential harms and expected benefits of routine surveillance and pre‐emptive correction of fistula stenosis.

Fixing Blood Vessel Problems for Dialysis: Is It Better to Act Early or Wait?

**Rationale**

Many people have kidneys that do not work well. They may need a treatment called dialysis to clean their blood. To get dialysis, doctors need an easy way to get to the blood. They create an access site, usually in the arm.

There are two main types of access sites.
*   A **fistula** is when a doctor connects one of your own arteries and veins. An artery is a blood vessel that takes blood from the heart. A vein is a blood vessel that takes blood back to the heart.
*   A **graft** is a small, soft plastic tube that a doctor uses to connect an artery and a vein.

Sometimes, these access sites can get a narrow spot. This is called a stenosis. A narrow spot can make it hard for blood to flow. This means your dialysis treatment may not work as well as it should.

Doctors have wondered what the best time is to fix a narrow spot. Should they do regular checks to find and fix a narrow spot early, before it causes a problem? Or should they wait and fix it only if it starts to cause a problem with dialysis? This study looked at which way is better.

**Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of 14 older studies. This helps to get a stronger answer by combining a lot of information.

In total, these studies included 1390 people who needed dialysis. All of them had either a fistula or a graft for their access site.

In each study, the people were put into one of two groups by chance.
*   One group had regular checks to look for narrow spots. If a narrow spot was found, it was fixed right away. This was done even if it was not causing any problems yet.
*   The other group did not have these regular checks. Their narrow spot was fixed only if and when it caused a problem with their dialysis treatment.

Researchers then compared the two groups. They wanted to see how long the access sites lasted and if they had any problems.

**Results**

The main finding was that fixing narrow spots early did not help the access site last longer for everyone. The results were different for people with grafts and people with fistulas.

**For people with grafts (the plastic tube):**
Fixing a narrow spot early did not help. It did not lower the risk of getting a blood clot. It also did not help the graft last any longer.

**For people with fistulas (your own blood vessels):**
Fixing a narrow spot early did seem to help. It lowered the risk of getting a blood clot. It may have also helped the fistula last longer.

However, there was a downside. The group that got regular checks and early fixes had more medical procedures. More procedures mean more visits to the hospital. They can also have their own risks and side effects.

Based on these results, the researchers came to these conclusions:
*   Regular checks and early fixes for narrow spots are not helpful for people with **grafts**.
*   For people with **fistulas**, it is more complex. Early fixes can help prevent blood clots. But they also lead to more procedures and risks.

More studies are needed to understand if the benefits of early fixes are worth the risks for people with fistulas.","Pre‐emptive correction of stenosis of the arteriovenous access for haemodialysis

Labour induction is the artificial stimulation of uterine contractions in order to bring about birth. It is commonly used in late pregnancy to address maternal and fetal problems.

Can Hypnosis Help Start Labor? A Search for Studies

**Rationale**
*What is labor and why do doctors sometimes need to start it?*

Giving birth is a natural process. The body usually knows when it is time for a baby to be born. The process of giving birth is called labor. Labor starts with feelings like cramps, called contractions.

Sometimes, doctors need to help labor begin. This is called ""starting labor"" or labor induction. Doctors may do this if there is a health risk to the mother or the baby.

*Why did we look for a new way to start labor?*

The common ways to start labor use drugs or special tools. These methods work well, but they can sometimes cause problems. These problems can include too much bleeding or the need for a C-section surgery. A C-section is an operation to deliver the baby. These methods can also cause infections for the mother or baby.

We wanted to see if there was a safer, more gentle way to help labor start. We looked at hypnosis as one option.

*What is hypnosis and why might it help?*

Hypnosis is a way to feel very relaxed and focused. A person can focus on a calm thought or feeling. This helps them block out other things around them.

Hypnosis is already used to help people with pain or fear. Some women use it to feel less pain during childbirth. It can also help women who feel very nervous about giving birth. Hypnosis may help women feel more confident and in control. If it works, it could be a good choice for some women.

**Trial Design**
*How was this research done?*

This was not a study with new patients. Instead, our team of researchers did a large search. We looked for all the studies that had already been done on this topic.

We looked for a special type of study. These studies are the best way to see if a treatment really works. In these studies, people are put into groups by chance. One group gets the new treatment, and the other group does not. Then, researchers compare the groups to see if the treatment made a difference.

Our goal was to find any of these high-quality studies. We wanted studies that tested hypnosis to start labor in pregnant women.

**Results**
*What were the main results of the search?*

Our search had a very clear result. We did not find any studies that met our standards. This means that right now, there is no strong proof from a major study that shows if hypnosis works to start labor.

*What does this mean for patients?*

Because we found no studies, we cannot say if hypnosis is a good or safe way to start labor. We do not know what the benefits or risks might be. The idea that it might help women who are very anxious is still just an idea. It has not been tested for starting labor.

*What are the main conclusions?*

Our main conclusion is that we need new research. We need good studies to be done on this topic.

Future studies should test if hypnosis is safe. They should find out if it really helps labor begin. These studies should also look at how many hypnosis sessions are needed and when they should happen. It is also important to know what kind of training is needed for the person leading the hypnosis.

The researchers also noted that it is important to be careful. Using hypnosis should not delay other medical care a woman might need. A doctor and patient should decide together if it is something they want to consider.","Hypnosis for induction of labour

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effect of positive expiratory pressure (PEP) physiotherapy to clear the airways of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). 
Background 
CF affects approximately one in 3000 live births in white populations and causes frequent lung infection, due to mucus blocking the airways. Chest physiotherapy is often used to try to clear the mucus from the lungs. We wanted to discover whether using a PEP device (a form of chest physiotherapy) was better or worse than other other forms of chest physiotherapy for clearing the mucus from the lungs in people with CF. A PEP device provides positive pressure behind the mucus to try to push it out of the lungs. This is an update of a previously published review. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to 20 February 2019.
Study characteristics 
The review includes 28 studies with 788 people (from infants to adults) with CF with mild to severe lung disease. The studies compared PEP to other methods of chest physiotherapy; the length of treatment ranged from a single session to two years of treatment. 
Key results 
Generally, the efficacy of PEP is similar to other methods of chest physiotherapy such as postural drainage with percussion, active cycle of breathing techniques, autogenic drainage, oscillatory PEP devices such as the flutter and acapella, thoracic oscillating devices such as the 'Vest', and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPaP) (typically used for ventilatory support, but by changing the inspiratory and expiratory pressures on the device and combining it with huffing, BiPaP has been used for airway clearance). We found no difference between PEP and other forms of chest physiotherapy in lung function, the amount of mucus cleared from the airways or its related effects on the health of people with CF. However, the rate of flare ups of respiratory symptoms decreased in people using PEP compared to other forms of physiotherapy such as a vibrating PEP device or a vibrating vest. There was some evidence that people with CF may prefer PEP to other chest physiotherapy methods. There was no evidence of PEP causing harm, except in one study where infants performing either PEP or percussion in various positions which use gravity to help drain secretions, experienced some gastro‐oesophageal reflux (regurgitation of food) in head‐down positions; this was more severe in the group using postural drainage with percussion. In all the other trials PEP was performed in a sitting position. 
In 10 of the 28 studies studied single PEP treatment sessions. The results from these studies are very limited as they could not report on the number of respiratory infections and lung function did not change with just one treatment. Two one‐year studies compared PEP to postural drainage and percussion; in the study with children, PEP improved their lung function, while in the adult study, lung function declined slightly with both PEP and postural drainage and percussion. Also, the method of performing PEP was different in the two age groups. 
Although PEP seems to have an advantage in reducing flare ups (based on the combined results of a few studies), different physiotherapy techniques and devices may be more or less effective at varying times and in different individuals during baseline function and chest flare ups. Each person should talk to their clinician to help choose which method of airway clearance is best for them and which they will adhere to, so as to provide the best quality of life and long‐term outcomes. 
Quality of the evidence 
Some studies were of low quality. These studies highlight the difficulty in comparing studies using PEP compared to other forms of chest physiotherapy. Factors such as age and severity of lung disease in the participants may affect the results as well as the method of performing each treatment. Overall, the evidence provided by this review for whether PEP reduces flare ups compared to other forms of chest physiotherapy was moderate to high quality, but evidence for other outcomes was of very low to moderate quality, as results were limited.

Comparing Ways to Clear Lungs for People with Cystic Fibrosis

### **Rationale**

Cystic fibrosis is a health problem that people are born with. It causes thick, sticky fluid, called mucus, to build up in the body. This mucus can block the airways in the lungs. This blockage can make it hard to breathe. It can also lead to serious lung infections.

People with cystic fibrosis need to clear this mucus from their lungs every day. One way to do this is with chest therapy. There are many types of chest therapy. This review of studies looked at a type called PEP. PEP stands for positive expiratory pressure.

When you use a PEP device, you breathe out into it. The device creates pressure in your lungs. This pressure helps push the sticky mucus up and out of your lungs. Researchers wanted to know if PEP therapy was better, worse, or the same as other types of chest therapy. They wanted to find the best way to help people with cystic fibrosis clear their lungs and stay healthy.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of past studies. They reviewed 28 studies that had already been done. This allowed them to combine the information from all of them.

The studies included 788 people who have cystic fibrosis. The people in the studies were all different ages, from babies to adults. Their lung problems ranged from mild to serious.

In these studies, people used PEP therapy to clear their lungs. Researchers compared their results to people who used other chest therapies. Some of these other therapies included special breathing methods. Others used devices that shake the chest to loosen mucus. The time people spent in the studies was different. Some studies looked at just one treatment session. Other studies followed people for up to two years.

### **Results**

Researchers looked at what the 28 studies found. They learned that PEP therapy works about the same as other chest therapies. It helped clear about the same amount of mucus from the lungs. It also did not lead to bigger improvements in lung function compared to other methods.

However, researchers did find one important benefit. People who used PEP therapy had fewer flare-ups. A flare-up is when breathing problems get much worse for a short time. This was seen when PEP was compared to other methods, like a vibrating vest. The studies also showed that many people may prefer using a PEP device over other types of chest therapy.

PEP therapy was found to be very safe. In one study, some babies had food come back up their throat. This happened when they were lying with their heads down for treatment. This problem was worse for babies using a different therapy. In all the other studies, people sat up when they used PEP. No one had this problem when they were sitting up.

The researchers concluded that no single chest therapy is the best one for every person. Different methods may work better for different people. They also may work better at different times. The most important thing is to choose a therapy that you will use every day. You should talk with your doctor to choose the best method for you. Doing your therapy every day is the best way to stay healthy and have a good quality of life.","Using positive expiratory pressure physiotherapy to clear the airways of people with cystic fibrosis

10.1002-14651858.CD009379.pub3,"Amniotic membrane transplantation for the treatment of ocular burns
How an ocular burn damages the eye 
The cornea is the transparent window of the eye that helps focus light to form an image of the outside world. For the cornea to remain transparent, it must have a healthy surface layer of epithelium, a stable tear film, and an absence of blood vessels. The epithelium is the moist cellular layer that covers the cornea, the white part of the eye, and the inside of the eyelids. The epithelium that covers the cornea is different from the epithelium of the conjunctiva. It is maintained in this state by a population of specialised stem cells found at the margin of the cornea (the limbus). In the normal eye, corneal epithelial cells slowly migrate from the limbus towards the centre of the cornea. 
A burn to the eye initially damages the surface epithelial layer, but it can also damage the deeper structures of the eye and the eyelids. A characteristic of an acute burn is an epithelial defect. This defect can fully recover after a minor burn. However, if the burn damages the stem cells of a segment of the limbus, the normal epithelium central to that area may not recover. The cornea is then covered by a functionally different type of epithelium derived from the peripheral conjunctiva, which may take weeks or months, and the cornea can become hazy and vascularised. In the absence of any epithelial covering, an additional risk is that the deeper tissues of the exposed cornea (stroma) may become progressively thinner and eventually perforate. The more extensive the damage to the limbus (measured in clock hours), the worse the outcome. The abnormal surface of the cornea, as well as haze and damage to structures within the eye (iris, lens, retina, optic nerve), can all lead to loss of vision. 
Treatments for ocular burns 
A burn to the surface of the eye is an emergency, and the eye must be washed immediately with water or saline to remove any chemical agents. The amount of damage to the epithelium (an epithelial defect) and the blood vessels at the edge of the cornea are measured, estimating the risk of future complications. The eye is then treated with medicines to reduce the risk of further complications and help the epithelial layer recover. Some doctors also use an amniotic tissue membrane placed over the surface of the eye. The amniotic membrane is the sac that surrounds a baby as it develops inside its mother. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to know whether using an amniotic membrane with medicines is better than just medicines. 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies in which an amniotic membrane was used to treat eyes that had been burned. We then looked for studies comparing eyes treated with medicines and an amniotic membrane patch with eyes treated using only medicines. We looked for randomised controlled trials, in which the treatment that people received was decided at random because these studies give the most reliable evidence about the effect of treatment. We assessed the treatment of moderate burns and severe burns separately, because they have different outcomes. We measured whether the treatment worked by comparing the proportion of eyes in which the epithelium over the cornea had failed to recover 21 days after the injury, visual function at the end of treatment, the presence of abnormal new blood vessels on the cornea, scarring between the cornea and the lids, the time taken for the epithelium to heal and adverse events in the intervention and control groups. We assessed the risk of bias in the randomised controlled study findings across pre‐specified domains. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to evaluate certainty of evidence include risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias.  
What we found 
We found two randomised controlled studies comparing the effect of medicines with the addition of an amniotic membrane patch inserted within seven days of the injury against medicines alone. One study suggested that treatment with amnion may be beneficial in moderate burns, but we found the certainty of the evidence to be low due to a high risk of bias and serious imprecision. For severe burns, there were no important differences between eyes that received an amniotic membrane and eyes that did not.  
Conclusions 
There is only uncertain evidence from randomised controlled studies of an important difference in healing between eyes treated with medicines and an amniotic membrane within seven days of an ocular burn and eyes that are treated only with medicines. Further research is needed to identify the best treatment for acute burns to the eye to reduce the risk of potentially devastating consequences and visual loss.

### **Plain Title**

Does a special patch help heal eye burns?

### **Rationale**

**What happens when an eye gets burned?**

Your eye has a clear front part that acts like a window. It is called the cornea. This window helps you see clearly. A thin layer of cells covers and protects this window, like skin on your body.

Special repair cells live around the edge of this window. These cells, called stem cells, are very important. They help the eye’s surface heal if it gets hurt.

A burn to the eye from a chemical or from heat is very serious. A burn can damage the protective cell layer. It can also harm the special repair cells that help the eye heal.

If the repair cells are damaged, the eye cannot fix itself well. The clear window can become cloudy, making it hard to see. New blood vessels might grow where they should not, which also blocks vision. In the worst cases, a hole can form in the eye. These problems can lead to a person losing their sight.

**How are eye burns treated?**

When an eye is burned, the first step is to wash it with water right away. After that, doctors use medicines, like eye drops, to help the eye heal. These medicines also help prevent scars and other problems.

Some doctors also use another treatment to help healing. They place a special, thin patch over the eye’s surface. This patch is made from the amniotic membrane. The amniotic membrane is the sac that surrounds and protects a baby as it grows in the womb. Doctors think this patch may have special things in it that can help reduce pain and help the eye heal faster.

**Why did we do this study?**

We wanted to know if this special patch really helps. We looked at past research to see if using the patch with medicines works better than just using medicines alone for people with eye burns.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

We did not do a new study with our own patients. Instead, we did a review. This means we searched for and carefully studied all the best medical studies that have already been done on this topic.

We looked for a specific type of study. These studies are the best way to test a treatment. In them, people are put into different groups by chance, like flipping a coin.

The people in these studies all had a burn to their eye. One group of patients was treated only with medicines. The other group was treated with both medicines and the special amniotic membrane patch. The patch was placed on the eye within 7 days of the injury.

We then compared the results from both groups. We wanted to see if the eye’s surface healed better in one group. We looked at how well the eye had healed after 21 days. We also looked at how well people could see and if they had problems like scars.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

Our search found two studies that compared using the special patch with medicine to using just medicine. We looked at the results for medium eye burns and for very bad eye burns separately.

For people with medium eye burns, one study showed that using the patch might be helpful. However, we are not very sure about this result. The way the study was done made it hard to be certain that the patch was the reason for the better healing. The proof was not very strong.

For people with very bad eye burns, the studies showed no real difference between the two groups. The eyes that got the special patch did not heal better or faster than the eyes that only got medicine.

**What does this mean?**

Based on the studies we have today, there is not enough good proof to say that using an amniotic membrane patch helps heal eye burns. We cannot say for sure that it is better than just using standard medicine.

More and better research is needed to find the best treatment for eye burns. Finding better ways to treat these injuries is very important to help people save their sight.","Amniotic membrane transplantation for the treatment of ocular burns
How an ocular burn damages the eye 
The cornea is the transparent window of the eye that helps focus light to form an image of the outside world. For the cornea to remain transparent, it must have a healthy surface layer of epithelium, a stable tear film, and an absence of blood vessels. The epithelium is the moist cellular layer that covers the cornea, the white part of the eye, and the inside of the eyelids. The epithelium that covers the cornea is different from the epithelium of the conjunctiva. It is maintained in this state by a population of specialised stem cells found at the margin of the cornea (the limbus). In the normal eye, corneal epithelial cells slowly migrate from the limbus towards the centre of the cornea. 
A burn to the eye initially damages the surface epithelial layer, but it can also damage the deeper structures of the eye and the eyelids. A characteristic of an acute burn is an epithelial defect. This defect can fully recover after a minor burn. However, if the burn damages the stem cells of a segment of the limbus, the normal epithelium central to that area may not recover. The cornea is then covered by a functionally different type of epithelium derived from the peripheral conjunctiva, which may take weeks or months, and the cornea can become hazy and vascularised. In the absence of any epithelial covering, an additional risk is that the deeper tissues of the exposed cornea (stroma) may become progressively thinner and eventually perforate. The more extensive the damage to the limbus (measured in clock hours), the worse the outcome. The abnormal surface of the cornea, as well as haze and damage to structures within the eye (iris, lens, retina, optic nerve), can all lead to loss of vision. 
Treatments for ocular burns 
A burn to the surface of the eye is an emergency, and the eye must be washed immediately with water or saline to remove any chemical agents. The amount of damage to the epithelium (an epithelial defect) and the blood vessels at the edge of the cornea are measured, estimating the risk of future complications. The eye is then treated with medicines to reduce the risk of further complications and help the epithelial layer recover. Some doctors also use an amniotic tissue membrane placed over the surface of the eye. The amniotic membrane is the sac that surrounds a baby as it develops inside its mother. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to know whether using an amniotic membrane with medicines is better than just medicines. 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies in which an amniotic membrane was used to treat eyes that had been burned. We then looked for studies comparing eyes treated with medicines and an amniotic membrane patch with eyes treated using only medicines. We looked for randomised controlled trials, in which the treatment that people received was decided at random because these studies give the most reliable evidence about the effect of treatment. We assessed the treatment of moderate burns and severe burns separately, because they have different outcomes. We measured whether the treatment worked by comparing the proportion of eyes in which the epithelium over the cornea had failed to recover 21 days after the injury, visual function at the end of treatment, the presence of abnormal new blood vessels on the cornea, scarring between the cornea and the lids, the time taken for the epithelium to heal and adverse events in the intervention and control groups. We assessed the risk of bias in the randomised controlled study findings across pre‐specified domains. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to evaluate certainty of evidence include risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias.  
What we found 
We found two randomised controlled studies comparing the effect of medicines with the addition of an amniotic membrane patch inserted within seven days of the injury against medicines alone. One study suggested that treatment with amnion may be beneficial in moderate burns, but we found the certainty of the evidence to be low due to a high risk of bias and serious imprecision. For severe burns, there were no important differences between eyes that received an amniotic membrane and eyes that did not.  
Conclusions 
There is only uncertain evidence from randomised controlled studies of an important difference in healing between eyes treated with medicines and an amniotic membrane within seven days of an ocular burn and eyes that are treated only with medicines. Further research is needed to identify the best treatment for acute burns to the eye to reduce the risk of potentially devastating consequences and visual loss.

10.1002-14651858.CD013225.pub3,"Background
This is an updated version of a Cochrane Review previously published in 2019.
Catamenial epilepsy describes worsening seizures in relation to the menstrual cycle and may affect around 40% of women with epilepsy. Vulnerable days of the menstrual cycle for seizures are perimenstrually (C1 pattern), at ovulation (C2 pattern), and during the luteal phase (C3 pattern). A reduction in progesterone levels premenstrually and reduced secretion during the luteal phase is implicated in catamenial C1 and C3 patterns. A reduction in progesterone has been demonstrated to reduce sensitivity to the inhibitory neurotransmitter in preclinical studies, hence increasing risk of seizures. A pre‐ovulatory surge in oestrogen has been implicated in the C2 pattern of seizure exacerbation, although the exact mechanism by which this surge increases risk is uncertain. Current treatment practices include the use of pulsed hormonal (e.g. progesterone) and non‐hormonal treatments (e.g. clobazam or acetazolamide) in women with regular menses, and complete cessation of menstruation using synthetic hormones (e.g. medroxyprogesterone (Depo‐Provera) or gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues (triptorelin and goserelin)) in women with irregular menses. 
Catamenial epilepsy and seizure exacerbation is common in women with epilepsy. Women may not receive appropriate treatment for their seizures because of uncertainty regarding which treatment works best and when in the menstrual cycle treatment should be taken, as well as the possible impact on fertility, the menstrual cycle, bone health, and cardiovascular health. This review aims to address these issues to inform clinical practice and future research. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of hormonal and non‐hormonal treatments for seizures exacerbated by the menstrual cycle in women with regular or irregular menses. We synthesised the evidence from randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials of hormonal and non‐hormonal treatments in women with catamenial epilepsy of any pattern. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases on 20 July 2021 for the latest update: Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 19 July 2021). CRS Web includes randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs from PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the specialised registers of Cochrane Review Groups including Cochrane Epilepsy. We used no language restrictions. We checked the reference lists of retrieved studies for additional reports of relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs and quasi‐RCTs of blinded or open‐label design that randomised participants individually (i.e. cluster‐randomised trials were excluded). We included cross‐over trials if each treatment period was at least 12 weeks in length and the trial had a suitable wash‐out period. We included the following types of interventions: women with any pattern of catamenial epilepsy who received a hormonal or non‐hormonal drug intervention in addition to an existing antiepileptic drug regimen for a minimum treatment duration of 12 weeks. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data on study design factors and participant demographics for the included studies. The primary outcomes of interest were: proportion seizure‐free, proportion of responders (at least 50% decrease in seizure frequency from baseline), and change in seizure frequency. Secondary outcomes included: number of withdrawals, number of women experiencing adverse events of interest (seizure exacerbation, cardiac events, thromboembolic events, osteoporosis and bone health, mood disorders, sedation, menstrual cycle disorders, and fertility issues), and quality of life outcomes. 
Main results
Following title, abstract, and full‐text screening, we included eight full‐text articles reporting on four double‐blind, placebo‐controlled RCTs. We included two cross‐over RCTs of pulsed norethisterone, and two parallel RCTs of pulsed progesterone recruiting a total of 192 women aged between 13 and 45 years with catamenial epilepsy. We found no RCTs for non‐hormonal treatments of catamenial epilepsy or for women with irregular menses. 
Meta‐analysis was not possible for the primary outcomes, therefore we undertook a narrative synthesis. For the two RCTs evaluating norethisterone versus placebo (24 participants), there were no reported treatment differences for change in seizure frequency. Outcomes for the proportion seizure‐free and 50% responders were not reported. For the two RCTs evaluating progesterone versus placebo (168 participants), the studies reported conflicting results for the primary outcomes. One progesterone RCT reported no significant difference between progesterone 600 mg/day taken on day 14 to 28 and placebo with respect to 50% responders, seizure freedom rates, and change in seizure frequency for any seizure type. The other progesterone RCT reported a decrease in seizure frequency from baseline in the progesterone group that was significantly higher than the decrease in seizure frequency from baseline in the placebo group. 
The results of secondary efficacy outcomes showed no significant difference between groups in the pooled progesterone RCTs in terms of treatment withdrawal for any reason (pooled risk ratio (RR) 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 3.00, P = 0.18, I2 = 0%) or treatment withdrawals due to adverse events (pooled RR 2.91, 95% CI 0.53 to 16.17, P = 0.22, I2 = 0%). No treatment withdrawals were reported from the norethisterone RCTs. The RCTs reported limited information on adverse events, although one progesterone RCT reported no significant difference in the number of women experiencing adverse events (diarrhoea, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, dizziness, headache, and depression). No studies reported on quality of life. 
We judged the evidence for outcomes related to the included progesterone RCTs to be of low to moderate certainty due to risk of bias, and for outcomes related to the included norethisterone RCTs to be of very low certainty due to serious imprecision and risk of bias. 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides very low‐certainty evidence of no treatment difference between norethisterone and placebo, and moderate‐ to low‐certainty evidence of no treatment difference between progesterone and placebo for catamenial epilepsy. However, as all the included studies were underpowered, important clinical effects cannot be ruled out. 
Our review highlights an overall deficiency in the literature base on the effectiveness of a wide range of other hormonal and non‐hormonal interventions currently being used in practice, particularly for those women who do not have regular menses. Further clinical trials are needed in this area.

A Review of Treatments for Seizures Linked to Monthly Periods

**Rationale**

Some women who have epilepsy find that they have more seizures at certain times during their monthly period. This is sometimes called catamenial epilepsy. It affects about 4 out of every 10 women with epilepsy. This can be a large burden for these women.

This may happen because of normal changes in the body’s chemicals, called hormones. Hormones control a woman's monthly cycle. These changes in hormones around a woman's period may make seizures more likely to happen.

Doctors are not sure which treatments work best to help control these seizures. They also want to know if treatments are safe. They wonder how treatments might affect a woman's period, her bone health, or her ability to have children. This study aimed to review past research to find the best and safest treatments for seizures linked to the monthly cycle.

**Trial Design**

This was not a new medical trial with patients. Instead, researchers did a review. They looked for all the best studies that had already been done on this topic. They looked for studies that compared a real medicine to a fake medicine, called a placebo. A placebo is like a sugar pill. This type of study helps to show if the real medicine is what is causing any changes.

The researchers found four studies to include in their review. A total of 192 women were in these four studies. The women were between 13 and 45 years old. They all had epilepsy with seizures that got worse around their monthly period.

In the studies, women took either a real medicine or a placebo for at least 12 weeks, which is about 3 months. This helped researchers see how the treatments worked over time.

**Results**

The review looked at studies of two different hormone medicines: progesterone and norethisterone. The researchers could not find any good studies on other types of medicines for this condition.

The results for the two medicines were not clear. For the medicine called progesterone, the two studies that tested it had different results. One study found that progesterone did not help reduce seizures any more than a sugar pill. But the other study found that progesterone did help reduce how often seizures happened. Because the results do not agree, we are still not sure if it works.

For the other medicine, called norethisterone, the review found that it did not seem to work better than a sugar pill to stop seizures.

The studies reported few side effects. Women who took the real hormone medicines did not seem to have more problems than women who took the sugar pill. The studies did not report on how the treatments affected the women’s quality of life.

The researchers who did this review came to a main conclusion. They concluded that there is not enough good proof that these hormone treatments help stop seizures linked to the monthly cycle. All the studies they found were small. Small studies can make it hard to see if a medicine has a real benefit.

This review shows that we need more and better research. We need larger studies to know for sure if these medicines can help. We also need new studies on other treatments for women whose seizures are linked to their monthly periods.","Treatments for seizures in catamenial (menstrual‐related) epilepsy
Background 
Catamenial (menstrual) epilepsy describes a worsening of seizures in relation to the menstrual cycle and may affect around 40% of women with epilepsy. There are specific times within the menstrual cycle when women are most at risk: in the days leading up to a menstrual period and during a menstrual period (perimenstrual or catamenial type 1 pattern); at the time of ovulation (catamenial type 2 pattern); and in the second half of their cycle (luteal phase, or catamenial type 3 pattern). The reason for this increased risk may relate to changes in the levels of progesterone (a hormone released by the ovaries) around the time of a menstrual period and oestrogen (a female sex hormone) surge around ovulation. Studies in animals have demonstrated that lower progesterone may affect how the brain reacts to the brain chemical gamma‐Aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is important in preventing seizures. The link between high levels of oestrogen and risk of seizures remains unclear. 
Current treatment of catamenial epilepsy depends on whether a woman has regular or irregular menstrual periods. If a woman has regular periods, hormonal (e.g. progesterone supplements) and non‐hormonal treatments (e.g. clobazam or acetazolamide) taken prior to and during a period may be used. In women who do not have regular periods, and who therefore cannot predict their period days, stopping periods using synthetic hormones (e.g. medroxyprogesterone (Depo‐Provera) or gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues (triptorelin and goserelin)) are treatment options. 
Catamenial epilepsy is common in women with epilepsy, and may have a significant negative impact on quality of life. Women may not receive appropriate treatment for their catamenial seizures. There is uncertainty regarding which treatment works best and when in the menstrual cycle treatments should be taken. There are also concerns about the possible impact on fertility, the menstrual cycle, bone health, and cardiovascular health. This review aimed to address these issues in order to inform clinical practice and future research. 
Objectives 
The aim of this review was to examine the effectiveness of hormonal and non‐hormonal treatments in stopping seizures in women with catamenial epilepsy. 
Methods 
We searched electronic databases to find relevant studies in which treatment was continued for at least 12 weeks. Our outcomes of interest were: average change in seizures, percentage of women achieving a reduction in seizures by at least 50%, and percentage of women who became seizure‐free. We also examined the reasons why women dropped out of the studies and any reported side effects. 
Results 
We included four randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) of hormonal treatments in the review, two trials evaluating progesterone and two evaluating norethisterone. In all of these studies, the treatment was compared to a placebo (a harmless sugar pill). We did not find any studies testing non‐hormonal treatments or any studies in women with irregular periods. The four included studies involved a total of 192 women aged between 13 and 45 years experiencing catamenial epilepsy. The included studies did not demonstrate any significant differences between groups when comparing progesterone or norethisterone to placebo for seizure outcomes. The included studies reported limited information on side effects, but women taking progesterone were no more likely to withdraw from the study due to side effects than those receiving placebo. 
The evidence is current to July 2021.
Certainty of the evidence 
We judged the certainty of the evidence to be very low to moderate, as the included studies provided unclear information on methods of blinding, recruited small numbers of participants, and were inconsistent in reporting treatment outcomes. 
Conclusions 
We found very limited, mostly low‐certainty evidence, of no difference in seizure outcomes for norethisterone and progesterone versus placebo in women with catamenial epilepsy. Our review highlights an overall lack of information on the effectiveness of a wide range of other hormonal and non‐hormonal treatments currently being used. Further studies in women with catamenial epilepsy are needed in this area.

10.1002-14651858.CD013173.pub2,"Background
Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) is an increasingly recognised neurodevelopmental condition; that is, a neurologically‐based condition which interferes with the acquisition, retention or application of specific skills. ASD is characterised by challenges with socialisation and communication, and by stereotyped and repetitive behaviours. A stereotyped behaviour is one which is repeated over and over again and which seems not to have any useful function. ASD often co‐occurs with mental health disorders, including obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). People with ASD may show certain cognitive differences (i.e. differences in ways of thinking) which influence their response to therapies. Thus, there is a need for evidence‐based guidelines to treat mental health issues in this group. 
OCD, a common condition characterised by repeated obsessional thoughts and compulsive acts, occurs with greater frequency in persons with ASD than in the general population. Genetic, anatomic, neurobiological and psychological factors have been proposed to explain this co‐occurrence. However, care should be taken to distinguish stereotyped and repetitive behaviours characteristic of ASD from obsessive compulsive acts in OCD. 
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the recommended treatment for OCD, but studies have suggested that this treatment may be less effective in those with OCD co‐occurring with ASD. Hence, modifications to CBT treatment may be helpful when treating OCD co‐occurring with ASD to optimise outcomes. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of behavioural and cognitive behavioural therapy for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in children and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). 
Search methods
We searched for studies in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, five other bibliographic databases, international trial registries and other sources of grey literature (to 24 August 2020). We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews to identify additional studies missed from the original electronic searches. We contacted subject experts for further information when needed. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cross‐over, cluster‐ and quasi‐randomised controlled trials involving both adults and children with diagnoses of OCD and ASD. We included studies of participants with co‐occurring conditions (i.e. those experiencing other mental illnesses or neurodevelopmental conditions at the same time), but we did not include individuals who had a co‐occurring global learning difficulty. Treatment could be in any setting or format and include behavioural therapy (BT) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which may have been adapted for those with ASD. Comparator interventions included no treatment, waiting list, attention placebo (where the control group receives non‐specific aspects of therapy, but not the active ingredient) and treatment as usual (TAU, where the control group receives the usual treatment, according to accepted standards). 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently screened studies for inclusion. The authors extracted relevant data from the one eligible study, assessed the risk of bias and certainty of evidence (GRADE). Outcomes of interest were changes in OCD symptoms and treatment completion (primary outcome), and severity of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and behavioural difficulties, as well as degree of family accommodation (secondary outcomes). We did not conduct meta‐analyses as only one study met the selection criteria. 
Main results
We included only one RCT of 46 participants in our analysis. This study compared CBT for OCD in persons with high‐functioning ASD with a control group who received anxiety management only. There were no differences in rates of treatment completion between the CBT (87%) and anxiety management (87%) groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.25; low‐certainty evidence). Behavioural difficulties were not included as an outcome measure in the study. This study showed that there may be a benefit at the end of treatment favouring CBT compared with anxiety management in OCD symptoms (mean difference (MD) ‐3.00, 95% CI ‐8.02 to 2.02), depression symptoms (MD ‐1.80, 95% CI ‐11.50 to 7.90), anxiety symptoms (MD ‐3.20, 95% CI ‐11.38 to 4.98), and quality of life (MD 5.20, 95% CI ‐1.41 to 11.81), but the evidence was of low certainty.  
Authors' conclusions
Evidence is limited regarding the efficacy of CBT for treatment of OCD in ASD. There is much scope for future study, not only examining the efficacy of CBT for OCD in ASD, but also the particular ways that OCD manifests in and affects people with ASD and the role of the family in treatment response. 
","Here is the Plain Language Summary based on the provided abstract.

### **Plain Title**

Does talking therapy help people with autism who also have obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?

### **Rationale**

**What is autism and OCD?**

Autism is a condition that affects how the brain grows and works. It can make it hard for a person to communicate with others. People with autism may also do the same things over and over. This is called repetitive behavior.

OCD is a mental health problem. People with OCD have unwanted thoughts that keep coming back. These are called obsessions. They may also feel a strong need to do certain actions repeatedly. These are called compulsions.

**Why did we do this study?**

Many people who have autism also have OCD. This can make life very difficult. The usual treatment for OCD is a talking therapy. It is called cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT. CBT helps people change their thoughts and actions to feel better.

But we are not sure if CBT works as well for people who have both OCD and autism. Their brains may work differently. So, the normal CBT might need to be changed to help them. This study wanted to find out if CBT is a good treatment for people with both autism and OCD.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers wanted to review all the best studies on this topic. They searched for studies that tested if CBT helps people with autism and OCD. A good study design is one where people are put into different groups by chance to compare treatments.

After looking everywhere, the researchers found only one study that matched what they were looking for. This summary is about the results of that one study.

The study they found included 46 people who had both autism and OCD. The study split these people into two groups to compare treatments.
*   One group received the talking therapy, CBT.
*   The other group learned ways to manage worry. This is called anxiety management.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The study found that people in the CBT group seemed to do a little better than people in the worry management group.
*   People who got CBT had slightly fewer OCD symptoms.
*   They also had slightly fewer symptoms of sadness and worry.
*   Their quality of life also seemed a bit better.

However, the researchers who reviewed the study said we must be careful. The proof that CBT was better was not very strong. This means we cannot be very sure about these results.

The same number of people in both groups were able to finish their treatment. This is a good sign. It suggests that people with autism and OCD can stick with this type of therapy.

**What do these results mean?**

Because there was only one small study, we still do not have a clear answer. There is not enough proof to say for sure that CBT is a good treatment for OCD in people with autism.

We need more and bigger studies to find out what really works. Future studies should also look at how families can be a part of the treatment and help their loved ones.","Behavioural and cognitive behavioural therapy for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) 
Aim of the review 
The aim of the review is to see if cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can help people who have OCD who also have ASD. 
Background 
People who have been given a diagnosis of ASD tend to have certain things in common. They often understand social interactions and communication differently to other people. People with ASD may also be less flexible in their thinking than other people, which may make it more difficult for them to use psychological therapies in the way that they are usually presented. The opinions of people with ASD are valuable in helping clinicians decide which research areas related to ASD should take priority. 
Someone who has been diagnosed with OCD has certain symptoms which, to some extent, affect how they are able to get on with their lives. Someone with OCD has persistent thoughts, although they don't want the thoughts and often think that the thoughts are unreasonable. These thoughts are often worries about themselves or someone else being harmed or about something not being perfect or just right. Sometimes the person with OCD feels as if they have to think thoughts or do actions repeatedly to 'make things right', even though they often really know that they don't need to. The repeated actions might be something like washing their hands. 
Research has shown that people with ASD are more likely to develop OCD. People may have certain genes that make them more likely to develop both ASD and OCD, or it may be that the way people with ASD tend to think makes them more likely to have OCD. 
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been used for a long time to treat OCD. CBT is usually carried out by visiting a therapist, but it can be delivered in different ways, such as online. CBT involves talking about the repeated thoughts that occur and helping the person manage and reduce them, and also involves trying to carry out compulsive actions less often. Because people with ASD sometimes have a different way of thinking and communicating, clinicians have wondered if CBT would be as useful to treat OCD in people with ASD as it is in people who have OCD but don't have ASD. Other researchers have devised ways to change the way that CBT is delivered to people with ASD to help them to get the most out of the treatment, and this is called 'adapted CBT'. Studies have shown that adapted CBT is useful for some anxiety disorders that occur in ASD. However, not as many studies have looked at how adapted CBT might be useful for OCD in people with ASD. 
Search 
We searched for randomised controlled trials of delivery of CBT to people with OCD who also had ASD. A randomised controlled trial is a trial where the participants are randomly allocated to CBT or another treatment group so that the people running the trial have no say about and do not know to which group the participants belong. The other treatment group is called the control group. In these studies, the people in the control group do not receive CBT, but they may have sessions with their therapists that do not include CBT, or they may be on a waiting list. If meeting with your therapist or waiting for time to pass were just as helpful as CBT, for example, then the results would be less likely to show a difference between the outcomes of the treatment group and the control group. Conversely, if CBT was more effective, then we might expect to see the CBT group doing better than the control group. Therefore, at the end of each trial, when the results in the treatment group are compared to the results in the control group, it gives information about how effective CBT might be for people with OCD and ASD. The evidence in this review is current to August 2020. 
Conclusion 
We found that there was only one published randomised controlled trial of delivery of CBT to people with OCD and ASD that met our search criteria. The control group in this trial was given a treatment called 'anxiety management' which helped the participants to manage anxiety but did not help them to deal specifically with repeated thoughts and actions, as CBT does. This study aimed to see if either anxiety management or CBT was better at treating OCD in people with ASD, but the study did not find a difference in response between the two treatments.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have yielded conflicting results regarding the ability of beta‐blockers to influence perioperative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Thus routine prescription of these drugs in an unselected population remains a controversial issue. A previous version of this review assessing the effectiveness of perioperative beta‐blockers in cardiac and non‐cardiac surgery was last published in 2018. The previous review has now been split into two reviews according to type of surgery. This is an update, and assesses the evidence in non‐cardiac surgery only.

To assess the effectiveness of perioperatively administered beta‐blockers for the prevention of surgery‐related mortality and morbidity in adults undergoing non‐cardiac surgery. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Biosis Previews and Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science on 28 June 2019. We searched clinical trials registers and grey literature, and conducted backward‐ and forward‐citation searching of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs and quasi‐randomized studies comparing beta‐blockers with a control (placebo or standard care) administered during the perioperative period to adults undergoing non‐cardiac surgery. If studies included surgery with different types of anaesthesia, we included them if 70% participants, or at least 100 participants, received general anaesthesia. We excluded studies in which all participants in the standard care control group were given a pharmacological agent that was not given to participants in the intervention group, studies in which all participants in the control group were given a beta‐blocker, and studies in which beta‐blockers were given with an additional agent (e.g. magnesium). We excluded studies that did not measure or report review outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE. 
Main results
We included 83 RCTs with 14,967 participants; we found no quasi‐randomized studies. All participants were undergoing non‐cardiac surgery, and types of surgery ranged from low to high risk. Types of beta‐blockers were: propranolol, metoprolol, esmolol, landiolol, nadolol, atenolol, labetalol, oxprenolol, and pindolol. In nine studies, beta‐blockers were titrated according to heart rate or blood pressure. Duration of administration varied between studies, as did the time at which drugs were administered; in most studies, it was intraoperatively, but in 18 studies it was before surgery, in six postoperatively, one multi‐arm study included groups of different timings, and one study did not report timing of drug administration. Overall, we found that more than half of the studies did not sufficiently report methods used for randomization. All studies in which the control was standard care were at high risk of performance bias because of the open‐label study design. Only two studies were prospectively registered with clinical trials registers, which limited the assessment of reporting bias. In six studies, participants in the control group were given beta‐blockers as rescue therapy during the study period. 
The evidence for all‐cause mortality at 30 days was uncertain; based on the risk of death in the control group of 25 per 1000, the effect with beta‐blockers was between two fewer and 13 more per 1000 (risk ratio (RR) 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.54; 16 studies, 11,446 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Beta‐blockers may reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction by 13 fewer incidences per 1000 (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.87; 12 studies, 10,520 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We found no evidence of a difference in cerebrovascular events (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.81; 6 studies, 9460 participants; low‐certainty evidence), or in ventricular arrhythmias (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.47; 5 studies, 476 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Beta‐blockers may reduce atrial fibrillation or flutter by 26 fewer incidences per 1000 (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.79; 9 studies, 9080 participants; low‐certainty evidence). However, beta‐blockers may increase bradycardia by 55 more incidences per 1000 (RR 2.49, 95% CI 1.74 to 3.56; 49 studies, 12,239 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and hypotension by 44 more per 1000 (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.51; 49 studies, 12,304 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
We downgraded the certainty of the evidence owing to study limitations; some studies had high risks of bias, and the effects were sometimes altered when we excluded studies with a standard care control group (including only placebo‐controlled trials showed an increase in early mortality and cerebrovascular events with beta‐blockers). We also downgraded for inconsistency; one large, well‐conducted, international study found a reduction in myocardial infarction, and an increase in cerebrovascular events and all‐cause mortality, when beta‐blockers were used, but other studies showed no evidence of a difference. We could not explain the reason for the inconsistency in the evidence for ventricular arrhythmias, and we also downgraded this outcome for imprecision because we found few studies with few participants. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence for early all‐cause mortality with perioperative beta‐blockers was uncertain. We found no evidence of a difference in cerebrovascular events or ventricular arrhythmias, and the certainty of the evidence for these outcomes was low and very low. We found low‐certainty evidence that beta‐blockers may reduce atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarctions. However, beta‐blockers may increase bradycardia (low‐certainty evidence) and probably increase hypotension (moderate‐certainty evidence). Further evidence from large placebo‐controlled trials is likely to increase the certainty of these findings, and we recommend the assessment of impact on quality of life. We found 18 studies awaiting classification; inclusion of these studies in future updates may also increase the certainty of the evidence.

### **Plain Title**
Do Heart Medicines Called Beta-Blockers Help People During Surgery?

### **Rationale**
Having surgery can be a big stress on your body. This stress can sometimes cause problems with the heart and blood vessels. Doctors want to find ways to protect patients from these problems.

One type of medicine used for this is a beta-blocker. Beta-blockers are heart medicines. They help the heart beat more slowly and with less force. This may protect the heart when it is under stress.

But past studies have shown different results. Some studies found that beta-blockers helped people during surgery. Other studies found that they did not help or even caused harm. Because of these mixed results, doctors are not sure if they should give these medicines to all patients having surgery.

This study was done to get a clearer answer. Researchers looked at many past studies together. They wanted to see if beta-blockers really help or harm adults who are having surgery that is not on the heart.

### **Trial Design**
This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers gathered and reviewed the results from many past studies. This type of review gives a stronger, more complete picture.

The researchers looked at 83 different studies. In total, these studies included nearly 15,000 adult men and women. All of these people were having surgery that was not on their heart. The types of surgery were different, from low risk to high risk.

In each of the studies, people were put into groups by chance. One group took a beta-blocker medicine. The other group got the usual care or a fake pill with no medicine in it. A fake pill is also called a placebo.

The time that people took the medicine was different in each study. Some people took the beta-blocker before their surgery. Others took it during or after their surgery.

### **Results**
The researchers found that using beta-blockers around the time of surgery has both good and bad effects. The proof from the studies was not very strong for most of the results.

Here is what the researchers found:

*   **Heart Attacks:** Beta-blockers may help lower the chance of having a heart attack. For every 1000 people who took a beta-blocker, about 13 fewer had a heart attack compared to those who did not.
*   **Irregular Heartbeat:** The medicine may also help prevent a type of fast, irregular heartbeat. For every 1000 people who took a beta-blocker, about 26 fewer had this problem.
*   **Death and Strokes:** The researchers were not sure if beta-blockers changed the risk of dying after surgery. They also did not find proof that the medicine changed the risk of having a stroke.

The studies also showed that beta-blockers can cause side effects:

*   **Slow Heart Rate:** Beta-blockers may make the heart beat too slowly. For every 1000 people who took a beta-blocker, about 55 more had a very slow heart rate.
*   **Low Blood Pressure:** The medicine also made low blood pressure more likely. For every 1000 people who took a beta-blocker, about 44 more had low blood pressure.

In conclusion, the researchers said that the decision to use beta-blockers for surgery is complex. These medicines may prevent some heart problems, but they may cause other issues like a slow heart rate. Because the proof is not very strong, more good-quality studies are needed. This will help doctors and patients decide what is best for each person.","Beta‐blockers to prevent death or serious events after surgery not involving the heart
This review assessed evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on whether beta‐blockers reduce deaths or other serious events when given to people undergoing surgery other than heart surgery. The findings for heart surgery are covered in another review. 
Background 
Surgery increases stress in the body, which responds by releasing the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline. Stress from surgery can lead to death or other serious events such as heart attacks, stroke, or an irregular heartbeat. For surgery that does not involve the heart, an estimated 8% of people may have injury to their heart around the time of surgery. Beta‐blockers are drugs that block the action of adrenaline and noradrenaline on the heart. Beta‐blockers can slow down the heart, and reduce blood pressure, and this may reduce the risk of serious events. However, beta‐blockers may lead to a very low heart rate or very low blood pressure which could increase the risk of death or a stroke. Prevention of early complications after surgery is important, but using beta‐blockers to prevent these complications is controversial. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to 28 June 2019. We included 83 RCTs with 14,967 adults who were undergoing different types of surgery other than heart surgery. Eighteen studies are awaiting classification (because we did not have enough details to assess them), and three studies are ongoing. The types of beta‐blockers used in the studies were: propranolol, metoprolol, esmolol, landiolol, nadolol, atenolol, labetalol, oxprenolol, and pindolol. Studies compared these beta‐blockers with either a placebo (disguised to look like a beta‐blocker but containing no medicine) or with standard care. 
Key results 
Beta‐blockers may make little or no difference to the number of people who die within 30 days of surgery (16 studies, 11,446 participants; low‐certainty evidence), have a stroke (6 studies, 9460 participants; low‐certainty evidence), or experience ventricular arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat rhythms, starting in the main chambers of the heart, that are potentially life‐threatening and may need immediate medical treatment; 5 studies, 476 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We found that beta‐blockers may reduce atrial fibrillation (an irregular heartbeat, starting in the atrial chambers of the heart, that increases the risk of stroke if untreated; 9 studies, 9080 participants; low certainty‐evidence), and the number of people who have a heart attack (12 studies, 10,520 participants; low‐certainty evidence). However, taking beta‐blockers may increase the number of people who experience a very low heart rate (49 studies, 12,239 participants; low‐certainty evidence), or very low blood pressure (49 studies, 12,304 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), around the time of surgery. 
In a few studies, we also found little or no difference in the number of people who died after 30 days, who died because of a heart problem, or had heart failure. We found no evidence of whether beta‐blockers alter the length of time in hospital. 
No studies assessed whether people who were given beta‐blockers had a better quality of life after heart surgery. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence in this review was limited by including some studies that were at high risk of bias, and we noticed that some of our findings were different if we only included placebo‐controlled studies or studies that reported how participants were randomized. We also found one large, well‐conducted, international study that had different findings to the smaller studies. It showed a reduction in heart attacks and an increase in stroke and all‐cause mortality when beta‐blockers were used, whilst the other studies did not show a clear effect. We were also less certain of the findings for outcomes with few studies, such as for ventricular arrhythmias. 
Conclusion 
Although beta‐blockers may make little or no difference to the number of people who die within 30 days, have a stroke, or have ventricular arrhythmias, they may reduce atrial fibrillation and heart attacks. Taking beta‐blockers may increase the number of people with a very low heart rate or very low blood pressure around the time of surgery. Further evidence from large, placebo‐controlled trials is likely to increase the certainty of these findings, and we recommend the assessment of impact on quality of life.

Cleft lip and cleft palate (the roof of the mouth) are common defects. The severity of the cleft (opening) varies and it can occur on one (unilateral) or both sides (bilateral). It can be difficult to feed babies enough nutritious food when they have this condition, and there is evidence of delayed development in children born with cleft. 
This review aimed to compare the effects of different feeding interventions such as maternal advice and support, modified bottles and/or teats, obturating or maxillary plates (plates placed in the roof of the mouth to artificially close the cleft palate) and supplemental breastfeeding in babies with cleft lip and/or palate prior to, or following, closure. Interventions in the first 6 months from term and used with breast milk or formula feeding only were considered, but outcomes (measures of growth, development and parental satisfaction) may have been measured at any time including adulthood. 
Maternal advice and support on feeding techniques and breastfeeding positions are often provided, but no studies evaluated the effectiveness of this intervention. Squeezable rather than rigid bottles may be easier to use for feeding babies with cleft lip and/or palate, and breastfeeding may have growth advantages over spoon‐feeding following cleft lip surgery. Only five studies (including 292 babies) compared the effects of feeding interventions in babies with cleft lip and/or palate on growth, development or parental satisfaction. Evidence for breastfeeding rather than spoon‐feeding following surgery was weak and there was a suggestion that squeezable bottles may be more manageable than rigid ones. No evidence was found to support the use of maxillary plates in babies with unilateral clefts and no studies assessed the effects of maternal advice or support. Further research is required to assess the most effective feeding interventions to prevent developmental delays in infants with cleft lip and/or palate.

Finding the Best Ways to Feed Babies with a Cleft Lip or Palate

**Rationale**

Some babies are born with a gap, or opening, in their lip or the roof of their mouth. This is called a cleft lip or cleft palate. It can be on one side or on both sides of the mouth.

Having a cleft can make it hard for a baby to eat. They may struggle to get enough milk and food to grow well. This can sometimes cause delays in how they grow and learn.

Researchers wanted to find the best ways to feed these babies. They looked for different methods that could help. They hoped to find a way to make sure these babies get the food they need to be healthy. This study looked at what we already know to see which feeding methods work best.

**Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, the researchers did a ""review."" A review means they gathered all the studies that had already been done on this topic. They looked at the results of these older studies all together to get a bigger picture.

The researchers looked for studies about feeding babies with a cleft lip or palate. The studies had to be about babies in their first 6 months of life. They looked at studies that tested different ways to feed babies. These included:
*   Giving parents advice and support.
*   Using special bottles or nipples.
*   Using special plates that sit in the roof of the mouth to cover the cleft.
*   Breastfeeding compared to other methods.

The researchers found only 5 studies that matched what they were looking for. In total, these studies included 292 babies.

**Results**

The main finding of this review was that there is not enough information to know for sure what is best. More research is needed to help families and doctors make good choices.

Here is what the researchers found from the few studies available:
*   Soft bottles that you can squeeze might be easier to use than hard, rigid bottles.
*   After surgery to fix a cleft lip, breastfeeding may be better for growth than feeding with a spoon. But the proof for this was not very strong.

The researchers also found what was missing. They did not find any proof that special mouth plates help babies with a cleft on one side. They also did not find any studies that tested if giving advice and support to parents made a difference.

The researchers concluded that we need more studies. Good research will help us find the best ways to feed babies with a cleft lip or palate. This will help them grow up healthy and strong.","Feeding interventions for growth and development in infants with cleft lip, cleft palate or cleft lip and palate

10.1002-14651858.CD011931.pub2,"Preventing pain after brain surgery
The problem 
There is increasing evidence that people who have undergone brain surgery experience significant pain. This pain can have serious consequences including raised blood pressure, agitation, prolonged recovery time and an increased risk of long‐term headaches. Research studies have looked at different drugs in an attempt to reduce the risk of pain for these people. There is now more evidence about pain reduction options for adults undergoing brain surgery but there remains uncertainty as to which options work best. 
The question 
This review aimed to determine which drugs provide the best chance of reducing pain for adults undergoing brain surgery, by collecting and combining the results of studies that looked at pain‐relieving drugs for this patient group. To provide an accurate answer to this question, only studies conducted in accordance with an approved high standard were included. Studies published in different languages and countries were included in order to obtain as much information as possible. 
In addition to determining which drugs were best at preventing or reducing pain after brain surgery, this review attempted to determine additional information such as how much additional pain‐relieving treatment was required in addition to the treatment under study; whether participants' pain was adequately controlled or not; how drowsy the participants were; what side effects they experienced; and how long they needed to stay in intensive care and in hospital. This review also considered whether some treatments worked better when given before or after surgery or for people undergoing different approaches to brain surgery. 
The results 
A total of 43 eligible studies, (42 complete and one still in progress), were found. Of the 42 completed studies (3548 participants), 10 studied injections of local anaesthetic into the scalp, 12 studied injection of local anaesthetic around specific scalp nerves, 8 studied nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 4 studied dexmedetomidine, 4 studied acetaminophen aka paracetamol), 2 studied opioid drugs, 3 studied gabapentin or pregabalin (anti‐seizure drugs that can also be used for pain relief) together with 1 study each of local anaesthetic injected into the veins, local anaesthetic injected into the jaw and the drug flupirtine. 
Sufficient information was abstracted to calculate the overall pain‐preventing effects of the following: local anaesthetic injections around the surgical wound, local anaesthetic injections around specific scalp nerves, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, dexmedetomidine and pregabalin or gabapentin. When only high‐quality studies were examined: NSAIDs reduced pain up to 24 hours after surgery, dexmedetomidine and local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves reduced pain in the first 12 hours after surgery, pregabalin or gabapentin reduced pain in the first 6 hours after surgery and local anaesthetic injections around the surgical wound significantly reduced pain 48 hours after surgery, but did not affect pain at earlier time points. 
When the timing of injection of local anaesthetics was examined, local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves provided better early pain relief (first 6 hours) when injected after surgery and better late pain relief (12 and 24 hours) when injected before surgery. 
The following interventions were also found to reduce the need for additional pain‐relieving drugs: local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves and dexmedetomidine. Gabapentin or pregabalin was found to reduce the risk of nausea and vomiting after surgery. 
Acetaminophen was not found to prevent pain after brain surgery or reduce the need for additional pain‐relieving drugs. 
Insufficient evidence was found to determine whether any of these drugs made the participants more or less drowsy, affected how long they needed to stay in intensive care or whether different drugs worked better for adults undergoing different approaches to brain surgery. 
The overall quality of the evidence that contributed to the results of this review was assessed and judged to be 'high' for pain‐reducing effects of NSAIDs, 'moderate' to 'low' for pain‐reducing effects of dexmedetomidine, acetaminophen, pregabalin and gabapentin and local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves and ' low' to ' very low' for pain‐reducing effects of local anaesthetic injections around the surgical wound, additional pain relief requirements and risk of nausea and vomiting after surgery .

Which Medicines Work Best for Pain After Brain Surgery?

### **Rationale**
Many people have a lot of pain after brain surgery. This pain can be a big problem. It can make your blood pressure go up. It can make you feel restless. It can also make it take longer for you to get better. Sometimes, it leads to headaches that last a long time.

Doctors want to find the best way to stop this pain. They have studied many different drugs. But doctors are still not sure which drugs work the best. There is a need to find a clear answer.

This study looked at the results of many past studies. The goal was to put all the information together. This helps find out which drugs best stop pain for adults after brain surgery. This work can help doctors make better choices for their patients.

### **Trial Design**
This was a special type of study called a review. The researchers did not give drugs to new patients. Instead, they gathered all the best past studies on this topic. They only used studies that met a high standard. This makes the final answer more trustworthy. The researchers looked at studies from all over the world.

The researchers found 42 finished studies. In total, these studies included about 3,500 adults. Every person in these studies had brain surgery.

The studies looked at different kinds of pain medicine. Some were numbing shots given in the scalp. These shots are also called local anesthetics. Other drugs were pills that you can swallow. Some were given through a small tube in a vein. This review compared how well each type of drug worked to stop pain. The researchers also wanted to learn if the drugs caused other problems, like making people sleepy.

### **Results**
The review showed that some drugs worked better than others.

**Drugs That Helped Reduce Pain**
*   A group of drugs called NSAIDs worked very well. An example of an NSAID is ibuprofen. These drugs helped lower pain for up to a full day after surgery. The proof for this was very strong.
*   Numbing shots given near certain nerves in the head also helped. These shots reduced pain for the first 12 hours after surgery. People who got these shots also needed less of other pain drugs. The timing of the shot seemed to matter. Shots given after surgery helped more right away. Shots given before surgery helped more later on.
*   A drug called dexmedetomidine helped reduce pain. It worked for the first 12 hours after surgery. People who got this drug also needed less of other pain medicines.
*   Drugs like pregabalin or gabapentin also helped. They are often used for seizures but can help pain too. They reduced pain for the first 6 hours. They also helped stop people from feeling sick or throwing up after surgery.
*   Numbing shots given right around the surgery cut also helped. But they only seemed to reduce pain two days after surgery. They did not help with pain right after the operation.

**A Drug That Did Not Seem to Help**
*   A very common pain drug is acetaminophen. It is also known as paracetamol or Tylenol. This review found that this drug did not help with pain after brain surgery. It did not reduce the need for other pain drugs either.

**What We Still Don’t Know**
The researchers could not find enough information on some things. They could not tell if any of the drugs made people more or less sleepy. They also could not tell if the drugs helped people get out of the hospital faster.

**Conclusions from the Study**
This review shows that some drugs are very good at preventing pain after brain surgery. NSAIDs seem to be a very good choice. The proof that they work is strong. Other drugs can also help, but the proof for them is not as strong. This means we need more good studies to be sure about how well they work.","Preventing pain after brain surgery

Review question  Is corneal collagen cross‐linking (CXL) a good treatment for slowing down the progression of keratoconus? 
Background  Keratoconus is a condition where the transparent front of the eye (cornea) gets thinner and begins to bulge. This leads to vision problems, usually short‐sightedness (distant objects appear blurred). The condition is more common in children and young adults and can deteriorate over time. Initially glasses and contact lenses can help. If the disease progresses, the only option may be a corneal transplant. 
CXL is a new treatment for keratoconus. The eye doctor removes the outer layer of the cornea, puts in vitamin B2 eye drops, and then treats the eye with ultraviolet A light radiation. This can be done in outpatients and takes about an hour. 
Study characteristics  The searches are current to August 2014. We found three randomised controlled trials, which were done in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. A total of 219 eyes were randomly allocated to treatment with CXL or no treatment. In all three studies the surgery was done in the same way. None of the studies included children. 
Key results  Eyes treated with CXL were less likely to have problems with progression of bulging compared to eyes that were not treated. However, the studies were small and there were some concerns about the way they were done. It is therefore difficult to say exactly how much the treatment helped. None of the studies reported the risk of eyesight getting worse but, on average, treated eyes had better vision (about 10 letters better) compared to untreated eyes. None of the studies reported on a change in quality of life for the participant. The main adverse effects were inflammation and swelling; this occurred in approximately one in 10 participants. 
Quality of the evidence  We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low because of problems in the way the studies were done and reported and the small number of eyes included.

### **Plain Title**

Does a New Treatment Help an Eye Problem Called Keratoconus?

### **Rationale**

**What is keratoconus?**
Keratoconus is a problem with the eye. It affects the cornea. The cornea is the clear front part of the eye that lets in light. In people with keratoconus, the cornea gets thin. It starts to bulge out into a cone shape.

This change in shape makes it hard to see clearly. Things that are far away may look blurry. This problem often starts in children and young adults. Over time, it can get worse.

**How is keratoconus treated now?**
At first, glasses or special contact lenses can help people see better. But if the eye problem gets very bad, a person might need a big surgery. This surgery is called a corneal transplant. Doctors replace the person’s cornea with a healthy one from someone who has died.

**Why did doctors do this study?**
Doctors are looking for a new way to treat keratoconus. They hope to find a treatment that can stop the problem from getting worse. This could help people avoid a big surgery like a transplant.

One new treatment is called corneal collagen cross-linking, or CXL for short. During CXL, an eye doctor puts special vitamin eye drops into the eye. Then, the doctor shines a special kind of light, called ultraviolet (UV) light, on the eye. This process helps make the cornea stronger. It may stop the cornea from bulging more. This study looked at past research to see if CXL really works.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**
This paper is a review. The researchers did not do a new study with patients. Instead, they looked at the results from three other studies that were already done. Bringing the results together helps us get a better idea of what the research shows.

The three studies took place in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Together, the studies looked at a total of 219 eyes. The people in these studies were all adults who had keratoconus. Children were not included in these studies.

In the studies, people were put into two groups by chance. One group got the CXL treatment. The other group got no treatment. Doctors then compared the two groups to see if the treatment made a difference. The CXL treatment itself takes about one hour to do in a clinic.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**
The review found that the CXL treatment seemed to help. The eyes that got the CXL treatment were less likely to have the bulging get worse. This is a good sign that the treatment can slow down the eye problem.

On average, people who had the CXL treatment could see better than those who did not. They could read about 10 more letters on an eye chart. This is like reading two more lines on the chart.

**Were there any side effects?**
Some people had problems after the treatment. About 1 out of every 10 people had red, sore, or swollen eyes for a short time.

**What did the researchers conclude?**
The researchers said we must be careful with these results. The studies they looked at were very small. They also had some concerns about how the studies were done. This means the proof that CXL works is not very strong yet.

The studies did not report on whether the treatment made people’s daily lives better. They also did not report the risk of eyesight getting worse. Because of these issues, the researchers said we need more and better studies. Larger studies will help us know for sure how well CXL works and if it is safe for people with keratoconus.","Corneal collagen cross‐linking for thinning of the transparent front part of the eye ('keratoconus') 
Review question  Is corneal collagen cross‐linking (CXL) a good treatment for slowing down the progression of keratoconus? 
Background  Keratoconus is a condition where the transparent front of the eye (cornea) gets thinner and begins to bulge. This leads to vision problems, usually short‐sightedness (distant objects appear blurred). The condition is more common in children and young adults and can deteriorate over time. Initially glasses and contact lenses can help. If the disease progresses, the only option may be a corneal transplant. 
CXL is a new treatment for keratoconus. The eye doctor removes the outer layer of the cornea, puts in vitamin B2 eye drops, and then treats the eye with ultraviolet A light radiation. This can be done in outpatients and takes about an hour. 
Study characteristics  The searches are current to August 2014. We found three randomised controlled trials, which were done in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. A total of 219 eyes were randomly allocated to treatment with CXL or no treatment. In all three studies the surgery was done in the same way. None of the studies included children. 
Key results  Eyes treated with CXL were less likely to have problems with progression of bulging compared to eyes that were not treated. However, the studies were small and there were some concerns about the way they were done. It is therefore difficult to say exactly how much the treatment helped. None of the studies reported the risk of eyesight getting worse but, on average, treated eyes had better vision (about 10 letters better) compared to untreated eyes. None of the studies reported on a change in quality of life for the participant. The main adverse effects were inflammation and swelling; this occurred in approximately one in 10 participants. 
Quality of the evidence  We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low because of problems in the way the studies were done and reported and the small number of eyes included.

Intestinal dysbiosis may contribute to the pathogenesis of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) in very preterm or very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. Dietary supplementation with synbiotics (probiotic micro‐organisms combined with prebiotic oligosaccharides) to modulate the intestinal microbiome has been proposed as a strategy to reduce the risk of NEC and associated mortality and morbidity. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of enteral supplementation with synbiotics (versus placebo or no treatment, or versus probiotics or prebiotics alone) for preventing NEC and associated morbidity and mortality in very preterm or VLBW infants. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, the Maternity and Infant Care database and CINAHL, from earliest records to 17 June 2021. We searched clinical trials databases and conference proceedings, and examined the reference lists of retrieved articles. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing prophylactic synbiotics supplementation with placebo or no synbiotics in very preterm (< 32 weeks' gestation) or very low birth weight (< 1500 g) infants. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors separately performed the screening and selection process,  evaluated risk of bias of the trials, extracted data, and synthesised effect estimates using risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD), and mean difference, with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the GRADE approach to assess the level of certainty for effects on NEC, all‐cause mortality, late‐onset invasive infection, and neurodevelopmental impairment. 
Main results
We included six trials in which a total of 925 infants participated. Most trials were small (median sample size 200). Lack of clarity on methods used to conceal allocation and mask caregivers or investigators were potential sources of bias in four of the trials. The studied synbiotics preparations contained lactobacilli or bifidobacteria (or both) combined with fructo‐ or galacto‐oligosaccharides (or both).  
Meta‐analyses suggested that synbiotics may reduce the risk of NEC (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.40; RD 70 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 100 fewer to 40 fewer; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 14, 95% CI 10 to 25; six trials (907 infants); low certainty evidence); and all‐cause mortality prior to hospital discharge (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.85; RD 50 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 120 fewer to 100 fewer; NNTB 20, 95% CI 8 to 100; six trials (925 infants); low‐certainty evidence). Synbiotics may have little or no effect on late‐onset invasive infection, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.21; RD 20 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 70 fewer to 30 more; five trials (707 infants); very low‐certainty evidence). None of the trials assessed neurodevelopmental outcomes. In the absence of high levels of heterogeneity, we did not undertake any subgroup analysis (including the type of feeding). 
Authors' conclusions
The available trial data provide only low‐certainty evidence about the effects of synbiotics on the risk of NEC and associated morbidity and mortality for very preterm or very low birth weight infants. Our confidence in the effect estimates is limited; the true effects may be substantially different from these estimates. Large, high‐quality trials would be needed to provide evidence of sufficient validity and applicability to inform policy and practice.

Can a special supplement help prevent a serious gut problem in tiny babies?

**Rationale**
Babies who are born very early or are very small can sometimes get a serious gut problem. This problem is called necrotising enterocolitis, or NEC. NEC is when a part of the baby’s gut tissue gets damaged and can die. This is a very dangerous condition for a small baby.

This problem may happen when there is an unhealthy mix of bugs, or bacteria, in the baby’s gut. The gut needs a good balance of good bugs and bad bugs to stay healthy. Researchers think that giving babies a special food supplement could help keep this balance right.

This supplement is called a synbiotic. A synbiotic is a mix of two things. It has “probiotics,” which are the good bugs that help keep the gut healthy. It also has “prebiotics,” which are a type of food that helps the good bugs grow.

The goal of this study was to look at past research. Researchers wanted to find out if giving synbiotics to these tiny babies can help protect them from NEC and other serious health problems.

**Trial Design**
This was not a new medical study with new babies. Instead, the researchers looked for all the studies that had already been done on this topic. They gathered the results from those past studies and looked at them all together. This helps give a stronger answer than one small study alone.

The researchers looked for studies where babies were put into groups by chance. In these studies, one group of babies was given a synbiotic. The other group was given a dummy treatment that looked the same but had nothing in it, or they received no treatment at all.

In total, the researchers found six studies to include. These studies involved 925 babies in total. All the babies in these studies were either born very early (before 32 weeks) or were very small at birth (weighing less than 1500 grams, or about 3.3 pounds). The babies were checked on until they were ready to leave the hospital.

**Results**
The results showed that giving synbiotics to these tiny babies may be helpful. Babies who got the synbiotic supplement seemed to have a lower risk of getting the serious gut problem, NEC. For every 1000 babies who got synbiotics, about 70 fewer babies got NEC compared to those who did not.

The results also showed that synbiotics might lower the risk of death before leaving the hospital. For every 1000 babies who got synbiotics, about 50 fewer babies died.

The researchers also looked at whether synbiotics helped prevent serious infections. The results were not clear. We do not know if synbiotics help with infections. The studies also did not look at how the babies’ brains developed over time.

It is very important to know that the researchers were not very sure about these results. They said the proof was of “low certainty.” This means the real benefit might be smaller or larger than what these studies found. Some of the past studies were small, and the way they were done was not always clear. This makes it hard to be certain about the results.

Because of this, the researchers concluded that we need more and better studies. We need large studies that are done very carefully to know for sure if synbiotics are safe and helpful for tiny babies. Until we have those better studies, doctors do not have a clear answer.","Do synbiotics prevent necrotising enterocolitis in very preterm or very low birth weight infants? 
Background 
Very preterm (born more than eight weeks early) and very low birth weight (less than 1.5 kg) infants are at risk of developing necrotising enterocolitis, a severe condition where some of the lining of the infant's bowel becomes inflamed, and the cells of this tissue die. This condition is associated with death, serious infection, and long‐term disability, as well as developmental problems. 
What did we want to find out? 
One way to help prevent necrotising enterocolitis may be to add synbiotics (combinations of probiotic bacteria or yeasts plus non‐digestible sugars to support probiotic growth and colonisation) to milk feeds. We wanted to find out whether synbiotics might benefit very preterm and very low birth weight infants. Our outcomes of interest included necrotising enterocolitis, death from any cause, serious infection, duration of hospitalisation since birth and neurodevelopmental outcomes. 
What did we do? 
For our Cochrane Review, we searched several important databases to identify randomized controlled trials that investigated the use of synbiotics for preventing necrotising enterocolitis in very preterm and very low birth weight infants. We used standard Cochrane methods to conduct our review and perform our analyses. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. 
What did we find? 
We found six trials with a total of 925 infant participants. Trials were mostly small, and most had design flaws that might have biased their findings. 
Main results 
Combined analyses showed that giving synbiotics to very preterm or very low birth weight infants may reduce the risk of necrotising enterocolitis and death. Synbiotics may have little or no effect in reducing the risk of serious infection, but the evidence is very uncertain. None of the studies that we identified assessed the effect of synbiotics on disability or developmental outcomes. 
What are the limitations of this evidence? 
Although the evidence from randomised controlled trials can potentially be of high certainty, the methods used in our review's included trials may have introduced biases that exaggerated the benefits of giving synbiotics to very preterm and very low birth weight infants. Also, because most of the trials were small, the effect estimates for some outcomes were imprecise. For these reasons, we graded down the certainty of the evidence. All evidence in our review is of low or very low certainty. 
There is low‐certainty evidence that synbiotics prevent necrotising enterocolitis and death from any cause. There is very low‐certainty evidence that synbiotics may have little or no effect in preventing serious infection. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
We conducted our database searches on 17 June 2021.

Self‐harm (SH; intentional self‐poisoning or self‐injury regardless of degree of suicidal intent or other types of motivation) is a growing problem in most countries, often repeated, and associated with suicide. Evidence assessing the effectiveness of interventions in the treatment of SH in children and adolescents is lacking, especially when compared with the evidence for psychosocial interventions in adults. This review therefore updates a previous Cochrane Review (last published in 2015) on the role of interventions for SH in children and adolescents. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of psychosocial interventions or pharmacological agents or natural products for SH compared to comparison types of care (e.g. treatment‐as‐usual, routine psychiatric care, enhanced usual care, active comparator, placebo, alternative pharmacological treatment, or a combination of these) for children and adolescents (up to 18 years of age) who engage in SH. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Specialized Register, the Cochrane Library (Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL] and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews [CDSR]), together with MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and PsycINFO (to 4 July 2020). 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing specific psychosocial interventions or pharmacological agents or natural products with treatment‐as‐usual (TAU), routine psychiatric care, enhanced usual care (EUC), active comparator, placebo, alternative pharmacological treatment, or a combination of these, in children and adolescents with a recent (within six months of trial entry) episode of SH resulting in presentation to hospital or clinical services. The primary outcome was the occurrence of a repeated episode of SH over a maximum follow‐up period of two years. Secondary outcomes included treatment adherence, depression, hopelessness, general functioning, social functioning, suicidal ideation, and suicide. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently selected trials, extracted data, and appraised trial quality. For binary outcomes, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence internals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CIs. The overall quality of evidence for the primary outcome (i.e. repetition of SH at post‐intervention) was appraised for each intervention using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included data from 17 trials with a total of 2280 participants. Participants in these trials were predominately female (87.6%) with a mean age of 14.7 years (standard deviation (SD) 1.5 years). The trials included in this review investigated the effectiveness of various forms of psychosocial interventions. None of the included trials evaluated the effectiveness of pharmacological agents in this clinical population. There was a lower rate of SH repetition for DBT‐A (30%) as compared to TAU, EUC, or alternative psychotherapy (43%) on repetition of SH at post‐intervention in four trials (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.82; N = 270; k = 4; high‐certainty evidence). There may be no evidence of a difference for individual cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)‐based psychotherapy and TAU for repetition of SH at post‐intervention (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.12 to 7.24; N = 51; k = 2; low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether mentalisation based therapy for adolescents (MBT‐A) reduces repetition of SH at post‐intervention as compared to TAU (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.06 to 8.46; N = 85; k = 2; very low‐certainty evidence). Heterogeneity for this outcome was substantial ( I² = 68%). There is probably no evidence of a difference between family therapy and either TAU or EUC on repetition of SH at post‐intervention (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.07; N = 191; k = 2; moderate‐certainty evidence). However, there was no evidence of a difference for compliance enhancement approaches on repetition of SH by the six‐month follow‐up assessment, for group‐based psychotherapy at the six‐ or 12‐month follow‐up assessments, for a remote contact intervention (emergency cards) at the 12‐month assessment, or for therapeutic assessment at the 12‐ or 24‐month follow‐up assessments. 
Authors' conclusions
Given the moderate or very low quality of the available evidence, and the small number of trials identified, there is only uncertain evidence regarding a number of psychosocial interventions in children and adolescents who engage in SH. Further evaluation of DBT‐A is warranted. Given the evidence for its benefit in adults who engage in SH, individual CBT‐based psychotherapy should also be further developed and evaluated in children and adolescents.

### **Plain Title**

Finding the Best Talking Therapies for Young People Who Self-Harm

### **Rationale**

**What is self-harm?**

Self-harm is when a person hurts their own body on purpose. This can include taking too much medicine or cutting their skin. It is a serious problem that is growing, especially among young people.

When a person self-harms, they often do it more than once. Self-harm is also linked to suicide. We need to find good ways to help young people who self-harm.

**Why was this study done?**

Doctors and researchers want to know what treatments work best for children and teens who self-harm. There is not a lot of clear proof about the best ways to help them. Most research has been done with adults.

This study looked at all the past research on treatments for self-harm in young people. The goal was to see which treatments helped young people stop self-harming. The researchers looked at talking therapies, medicines, and natural products.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review, which means the researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they gathered and studied the results from 17 other studies. This helps to get a bigger and clearer picture of what the research shows.

The people in these studies were children and teens up to 18 years old. They had all recently self-harmed and gone to a hospital or clinic for help. In total, the studies included over 2,000 young people. About 9 out of 10 of them were girls. Their average age was about 15.

The studies followed the young people for up to two years. This was to see if the treatments helped them to stop self-harming over time. The studies compared different talking therapies to the care that young people normally get. This is called “usual care.”

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The researchers found that all the studies they looked at tested talking therapies. They did not find any studies that tested medicines for self-harm in young people.

Here is what they found about different talking therapies:

*   **Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Adolescents (DBT-A):** This therapy helps young people learn skills to manage their feelings and deal with hard times. DBT-A seemed to work well. In the studies, about 3 out of 10 young people who got DBT-A self-harmed again. In the groups that got usual care, about 4 out of 10 young people self-harmed again. The researchers were very sure about this result.

*   **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** This therapy helps people change their unhelpful thoughts and actions. The researchers were not sure if this therapy helped young people stop self-harming. The proof was not strong enough to be sure.

*   **Mentalization Based Therapy for Adolescents (MBT-A):** This therapy helps people understand their own thoughts and feelings, and the thoughts and feelings of others. The researchers were very unsure if this therapy worked. The proof was very weak.

*   **Family Therapy and other therapies:** Family therapy did not seem to make a difference in stopping self-harm. Other treatments, like group therapy or getting an emergency contact card, also did not show a clear benefit.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

The researchers concluded that we need more and better studies on therapies for young people who self-harm.

DBT-A seems to be a good treatment that helps reduce self-harm. More research should be done on DBT-A. CBT is another therapy that should be studied more in young people, as it has been shown to help adults. For most other therapies, the proof is not yet strong enough to say if they help or not.","Interventions for children and adolescents who self‐harm
We have reviewed the international literature regarding psychosocial interventions, pharmacological (drug), and natural product (dietary supplementation) treatment trials in the field. A total of 17 trials meeting our inclusion criteria were identified. There is little evidence of beneficial effects for individual cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)‐based psychotherapy, mentalisation‐based therapy for adolescents (MBT‐A), group‐based psychotherapy, enhanced assessment approaches, compliance enhancement approaches, family interventions, or remote contact interventions. There is some evidence of effectiveness for dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT‐A) for adolescents. However, few trials have been conducted and those that have are generally small, meaning that possible beneficial effects of some of these therapies cannot be ruled out. 
Why is this review important? 
Self‐harm (SH), which includes intentional self‐poisoning/overdose and self‐injury, is a major problem in many countries and is strongly linked with suicide. It is therefore important that effective treatments for SH patients are developed. There has been an increase in the use of interventions for SH in children and adolescents. It is therefore important to assess the evidence for their effectiveness. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
Hospital administrators (e.g. service providers), health policy officers and third party payers (e.g. health insurers), clinicians working with patients who engage in SH, patients themselves, and their relatives. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
This review is an update of a previous Cochrane Review from 2015 which found little evidence of beneficial effects of interventions for SH in children and adolescents. This updated review aims to further evaluate the evidence for effectiveness of interventions for children and adolescents with SH with a broader range of outcomes. 
Which studies were included in the review? 
To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials of either psychosocial or drug treatments for children and adolescents up to 18 years of age who had recently engaged in SH. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
There have been surprisingly few investigations of treatments for SH in children and adolescents, despite the size of this problem in many countries. We found positive effects of DBT‐A on repetition of SH. There is currently no clear evidence for the effectiveness of individual CBT‐based psychotherapy, MBT‐A, group‐based psychotherapy, enhanced assessment approaches, compliance enhancement approaches, family interventions, or remote contact interventions in preventing repetition of SH. 
What should happen next? 
We recommend further trials of DBT‐A. Given the evidence for its benefit for adults who engage in SH, individual CBT‐based psychotherapy should also be further developed and evaluated in children and adolescents. Given the extent of SH in children and adolescents, greater attention should be paid to the development and evaluation of specific therapies for this population.

We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. We found two studies that studied the effect of the delivery method on stress reduction in workers. 
Key messages 
The effects of the delivery method on stress reduction were unclear. More research should be conducted to directly compare equivalent stress management programmes delivered via a computer and in‐person. Any future studies will likely affect the conclusions of this review.

Learning to Manage Stress at Work: Is a Computer or a Person a Better Teacher?

### **Rationale**

Many people feel stress because of their jobs. Stress at work can make you feel tired, worried, or even sick. When you feel this way, it can be hard to do your job well.

Companies want to help their workers feel better and be less stressed. They often offer special programs to teach people how to manage stress. These programs show people ways to feel more calm and in control.

Some of these programs are on a computer or a phone. You can do them on your own time. Other programs are taught by a live person in a class. We know that both types of programs can help people. What we did not know is if one way of teaching works better than the other. This review was done to find out if learning from a computer is different from learning from a person.

### **Trial Design**

This was a special kind of study called a review. We did not do a new study with new people. Instead, our team looked for all the studies that were already done on this topic. We searched for studies that directly compared a computer program for stress with an in-person program for stress.

We found two studies that fit what we were looking for. These two studies included a total of 159 workers. In the studies, some workers used a computer program to learn about stress. Other workers learned the same things from a person. The report we looked at did not say how long each person spent in their stress program.

### **Results**

We looked closely at the results from the two studies. Both studies taught workers skills to notice their stress and find ways to lower it. But the two studies had different results, which means they did not agree with each other.

Because the results were different, we cannot say if one way is better. It is not clear if the computer program or the in-person program helped workers more to reduce their stress.

This review shows that we need more research to find a clear answer. New studies should be done to compare the same stress program given in two different ways: on a computer and in person. The people who wrote this review think that new studies could give us a clearer answer in the future. The information for this review was collected from studies published up to February 2017.","Computer‐based versus in‐person stress management programmes for workers

Misoprostol given orally is a commonly used labour induction method. Our Cochrane Review is restricted to studies with low‐dose misoprostol (initially ≤ 50 µg), as higher doses pose unacceptably high risks of uterine hyperstimulation. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of low‐dose oral misoprostol for labour induction in women with a viable fetus in the third trimester of pregnancy. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov,  the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (14 February 2021) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials comparing low‐dose oral misoprostol (initial dose ≤ 50 µg) versus placebo, vaginal dinoprostone, vaginal misoprostol, oxytocin, or mechanical methods; or comparing oral misoprostol protocols (one‐ to two‐hourly versus four‐ to six‐hourly; 20 µg to 25 µg versus 50 µg; or 20 µg hourly titrated versus 25 µg two‐hourly static). 
Data collection and analysis
Using Covidence, two review authors independently screened reports, extracted trial data, and performed quality assessments. Our primary outcomes were vaginal birth within 24 hours, caesarean section, and hyperstimulation with foetal heart changes. 
Main results
We included 61 trials involving 20,026 women. GRADE assessments ranged from moderate‐ to very low‐certainty evidence, with downgrading decisions based on imprecision, inconsistency, and study limitations. 
Oral misoprostol versus placebo/no treatment (four trials; 594 women) 
Oral misoprostol may make little to no difference in the rate of caesarean section (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.11; 4 trials; 594 women; moderate‐certainty evidence), while its effect on uterine hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes is uncertain (RR 5.15, 95% CI 0.25 to 105.31; 3 trials; 495 women; very low‐certainty evidence). Vaginal births within 24 hours was not reported. In all trials, oxytocin could be commenced after 12 to 24 hours and all women had pre‐labour ruptured membranes. 
Oral misoprostol versus vaginal dinoprostone (13 trials; 9676 women) 
Oral misoprostol probably results in fewer caesarean sections (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.90; 13 trials, 9676 women; moderate‐certainty evidence). Subgroup analysis indicated that 10 µg to 25 µg (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.87; 9 trials; 8652 women) may differ from 50 µg (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.34; 4 trials; 1024 women) for caesarean section. Oral misoprostol may decrease vaginal births within 24 hours (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.00; 10 trials; 8983 women; low‐certainty evidence) and hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.59; 11 trials; 9084 women; low‐certainty evidence). 
Oral misoprostol versus vaginal misoprostol (33 trials; 6110 women) 
Oral use may result in fewer vaginal births within 24 hours (average RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.95; 16 trials, 3451 women; low‐certainty evidence), and less hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.92, 25 trials, 4857 women, low‐certainty evidence), with subgroup analysis suggesting that 10 µg to 25 µg orally (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.57; 6 trials, 957 women) may be superior to 50 µg orally (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.11; 19 trials; 3900 women). Oral misoprostol probably does not increase caesarean sections overall (average RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.16; 32 trials; 5914 women; low‐certainty evidence) but likely results in fewer caesareans for foetal distress (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.99; 24 trials, 4775 women). 
Oral misoprostol versus intravenous oxytocin (6 trials; 737 women, 200 with ruptured membranes) 
Misoprostol may make little or no difference to vaginal births within 24 hours (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.33; 3 trials; 466 women; low‐certainty evidence), but probably results in fewer caesarean sections (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.90; 6 trials; 737 women; moderate‐certainty evidence). The effect on hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes is uncertain (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.26; 3 trials, 331 women; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Oral misoprostol versus mechanical methods (6 trials; 2993 women) 
Six trials compared oral misoprostol to transcervical Foley catheter. Misoprostol may increase vaginal birth within 24 hours (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.79; 4 trials; 1044 women; low‐certainty evidence), and probably reduces the risk of caesarean section (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.95; 6 trials; 2993 women; moderate‐certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference in hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.21; 4 trials; 2828 women; low‐certainty evidence). 
Oral misoprostol one‐ to two‐hourly versus four‐ to six‐hourly (1 trial; 64 women) 
The evidence on hourly titration was very uncertain due to the low numbers reported.
Oral misoprostol 20 µg hourly titrated versus 25 µg two‐hourly static (2 trials; 296 women) 
The difference in regimen may have little or no effect on the rate of vaginal births in 24 hours (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.16; low‐certainty evidence). The evidence is of very low certainty for all other reported outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
Low‐dose oral misoprostol is probably associated with fewer caesarean sections (and therefore more vaginal births) than vaginal dinoprostone, and lower rates of hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes. However, time to birth may be increased, as seen by a reduced number of vaginal births within 24 hours. 
Compared to transcervical Foley catheter, low‐dose oral misoprostol is associated with fewer caesarean sections, but equivalent rates of hyperstimulation. 
Low‐dose misoprostol given orally rather than vaginally is probably associated with similar rates of vaginal birth, although rates may be lower within the first 24 hours. However, there is likely less hyperstimulation with foetal heart changes, and fewer caesarean sections performed due to foetal distress. 
The best available evidence suggests that low‐dose oral misoprostol probably has many benefits over other methods for labour induction. This review supports the use of low‐dose oral misoprostol for induction of labour, and demonstrates the lower risks of hyperstimulation than when misoprostol is given vaginally. More trials are needed to establish the optimum oral misoprostol regimen, but these findings suggest that a starting dose of 25 µg may offer a good balance of efficacy and safety.

### **Plain Title**

Is a Pill a Safe and Good Way to Start Labor?

### **Rationale**

Sometimes, a doctor needs to help labor start. This is called ""inducing labor."" It is done to keep the mother and baby healthy. Doctors have many ways to start labor. It is important to know which way is the safest and works best.

One way to start labor is with a pill called misoprostol. Taking too much of this pill can cause problems. It can make the womb have too many strong contractions. This can be unsafe for the baby’s heart.

This study looked at many past studies. Researchers wanted to know if taking a **low dose** of the misoprostol pill is a good way to start labor. They compared it to other common ways to see which was safer and worked better for mothers and babies.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study. Instead, researchers looked at the results of 61 past studies. This is called a review. Looking at many studies together can give a stronger answer.

The studies included over 20,000 pregnant women. The women were in their last 3 months of pregnancy. Their babies were healthy and almost ready to be born. The studies were designed to be very fair. Women were put into different groups by chance.

Each study compared women who took the low-dose misoprostol pill to women who used other ways to start labor. These other ways included:
*   A sugar pill that had no medicine in it.
*   A medicine put into the vagina.
*   A medicine given through a needle in the arm.
*   A special tube to help open the womb.

Researchers followed the women until they gave birth. They looked to see who had a vaginal birth and who needed surgery to deliver the baby. This surgery is called a C-section. They also checked if the baby’s heart rate was safe during labor.

### **Results**

Here is what the researchers found when they compared the misoprostol pill to other methods.

**Compared to other medicines:**
*   The pill probably led to fewer C-sections than a medicine put in the vagina (dinoprostone).
*   The pill also led to fewer C-sections than a medicine given by needle (oxytocin).
*   The pill was safer for the baby’s heart than the same medicine put in the vagina. It caused fewer problems with the baby’s heart rate.
*   But, taking the pill by mouth may mean labor takes a little longer to start.

**Compared to a special tube (Foley catheter):**
*   The pill probably led to fewer C-sections.
*   The risk of problems with the baby’s heart rate was about the same for both methods.

**What the researchers concluded:**
The researchers believe that a low-dose misoprostol pill is a good choice for starting labor. It seems to have many benefits. It can help more women have a vaginal birth. This means fewer women may need a C-section.

The pill also seems safer for the baby’s heart than other medicines. The study shows that a low-dose pill offers a good balance. It works well and is safe. The researchers suggest that a starting dose of 25 micrograms might be best. More studies are needed to find the perfect dose and timing.","Low‐dose misoprostol given by mouth for induction of labour
We looked at the evidence from randomised controlled trials to see if low‐dose misoprostol given by mouth is effective in starting labour in women in their third trimester with a live baby. We compared misoprostol with other commonly used methods of inducing labour. 
What is the issue? 
Artificially starting labour, or induction, is common in pregnancy. Reasons include the mother having high blood pressure in pregnancy or the baby being past the due date. Misoprostol is a type of prostaglandin that can be taken in low doses by mouth to induce labour. Prostaglandins are hormone‐like compounds that are made by the body for various functions (including the natural onset of labour). Unlike other prostaglandins such as vaginal dinoprostone, misoprostol does not need to be stored in the refrigerator. Taking a tablet is convenient to mothers and the low‐dose tablet sizes are now available (25 µg).  
Why is this important? 
A good induction method achieves a safe birth for mother and baby. It is effective, results in a relatively low number of caesarean sections, has few side effects, and is highly acceptable to mothers. Some methods of inducing labour may cause more caesarean sections by being ineffective at bringing on labour, other methods may lead to more caesareans as they cause too many contractions (hyperstimulation) that result in the baby becoming distressed (foetal heart rate changes). 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence on 14 February 2021 and identified 61 trials involving 20,026 women for inclusion in this review. Not all trials were high quality. 
Starting with oral misoprostol immediately may have a similar effect on rates of caesarean section (4 trials, 594 women; low‐certainty evidence) to giving no treatment for 12 to 24 hours then starting oxytocin, while the effects of misoprostol on uterine hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes are unclear (3 trials, 495 women; very low‐quality evidence). All women in theses trials had ruptured membranes. 
Oral misoprostol was compared to vaginal dinoprostone in 13 trials (9676 women). Misoprostol use probably decreased the risk of caesarean section (moderate‐certainty evidence). When studies were divided by their initial dose of misoprostol, there was evidence that use of 10 µg to 25 µg may be effective in reducing the risk of a caesarean section (9 trials, 8652 women), while the higher 50 µg dose might not reduce the risk (4 trials, 1024 women). There may be very small or no differences between misoprostol and dinoprostone in rates of vaginal births within 24 hours (10 trials, 8983 women; low‐certainty evidence) but may be fewer cases of hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes with oral misoprostol (11 trials, 9084 women; low‐certainty evidence).  
Oral misoprostol was compared with vaginal misoprostol in 33 trials (6110 women). Oral use may have resulted in fewer vaginal births within 24 hours (16 trials, 3451 women; low‐certainty evidence). Oral use may have caused less hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (25 trials, 4857 women; low‐certainty evidence), especially with a dose of 10 µg to 25 µg. There was no clear difference in the number of caesarean sections overall (32 trials, 5914 women; low‐certainty evidence) but oral use likely resulted in fewer caesareans being performed because of concerns of the baby being in distress (24 trials, 4775 women). 
When oral misoprostol was compared to oxytocin for induction, misoprostol use probably resulted in fewer caesarean sections (6 trials, 737 women). We found no clear difference in vaginal birth within 24 hours (3 trials, 466 women; moderate‐certainty evidence) or hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (3 trials, 331 women; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Oral misoprostol was compared to a balloon catheter inserted in the cervix to mechanically induce labour. The number of vaginal births within 24 hours may have increased with misoprostol (4 trials, 1044 women; low‐certainty evidence). Misoprostol probably reduced the risk of caesarean section (6 trials, 2993 women; moderate‐certainty evidence) with no difference in risk of hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (4 trials, 1044 women; low‐certainty evidence). 
Different doses and timings of giving oral misoprostol were explored in three small trials. The certainty of the findings from these trials was either low or very low so we cannot draw any meaningful conclusions from this data. 
What does this mean? 
Using low‐dose (50 µg or less) oral misoprostol to induce labour likely leads to fewer caesarean sections and so more vaginal births than vaginal dinoprostone, oxytocin, and a transcervical Foley catheter. Rates of hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes were comparable with these methods. Misoprostol taken by mouth causes less hyperstimulation with foetal heart changes compared to when taken vaginally.  
More trials are needed to establish the most effective misoprostol regimen for labour induction, but for now the findings of this review support oral rather than vaginal use, and suggest that commencing oral misoprostol at a dose of 25 µg or less may be safe and effective.

Epiretinal membrane is an abnormal sheet of avascular fibrocellular tissue that develops on the inner surface of the retina. Epiretinal membrane can cause impairment of sight as a consequence of progressive distortion of retinal architecture. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of surgery compared to no intervention for epiretinal membrane.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, ISRCTN registry, US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). There were no restrictions to language or year of publication. The databases were last searched on 20 May 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing surgical removal of idiopathic epiretinal membrane compared to placebo, no treatment or sham treatment. Paired or within‐person studies were included, as well as those where both eyes of a single participant were treated. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methods expected by Cochrane, and assessed certainty using the GRADE system. We considered the following five outcome measures: mean change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the study eye between baseline (before randomisation), 6 months and 12 months later; proportion of people with a gain of 0.3 logMAR or more of visual acuity in the study eye as measured by a logMAR chart at a starting distance of 4 m at 6 months and 12 months after randomisation; proportion of people with a loss of 0.3 logMAR or more of visual acuity in the study eye as measured by a logMAR chart at a starting distance of 4 m at 6 months and 12 months after randomisation; mean quality of life score at 6 months and 12 months following surgery, measured using a validated questionnaire; and any harm identified during follow‐up. 
Main results
We included one study in the review. This was a RCT including 53 eyes of 53 participants with mild symptomatic epiretinal membrane and BCVA of 65 or more Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters. Participants were randomly allocated to immediate surgery or to watchful waiting with deferred surgery if indicated by evidence of disease progression. The study was limited by imprecision owing to the small number of participants and was at some risk of bias owing to inconsistencies in the time points for outcome assessment and in the management of lens opacity. 
At 12 months, the visual acuity in the immediate surgery group was higher by a mean of 2.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐2.0 to 6.2 ETDRS letters; 53 participants; low‐certainty evidence) than the watchful waiting/deferred surgery group. 
The evidence of the effect of immediate surgery on gains of 0.3 logMAR or more of visual acuity is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% CI 0.06 to 4.93; 53 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
At 12 months, no participant in either group sustained a loss of 0.3 logMAR or more of visual acuity (53 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
The included study did not measure quality of life.
At 12 months, no serious adverse event was identified in any participant. One participant developed chronic minimal cystoid macular oedema following immediate surgery (53 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
We found no RCT that directly investigated the effect of surgery compared to no intervention. For severe disabling epiretinal membrane, the lack of a RCT comparing surgery to no intervention may reflect evidence from non‐randomised studies in favour of surgery; a RCT may be considered unnecessary and ethically unacceptable because a superior effect of surgery is widely accepted. For mild symptomatic epiretinal membrane, however, the value of surgery is uncertain. Low‐certainty evidence from this review suggests that watchful waiting or deferred surgery may offer outcomes as favourable as immediate surgery. However, this finding needs to be confirmed in further RCTs with appropriate statistical power, masking of treatment allocation, consistent management of cataract, and measurement of outcomes including patient‐reported quality of life over a more extended time frame.

### **Plain Title**
Is Surgery the Best Treatment for an Eye Problem Called Epiretinal Membrane?

### **Rationale**
An epiretinal membrane is a thin layer of scar tissue. It can grow on the back part of the eye called the retina. The retina is the part of your eye that helps you see clearly.

When this tissue grows, it can start to pull on the retina. This can make your vision blurry or distorted. For example, straight lines might look wavy. This can make daily tasks like reading or driving hard to do.

Doctors are not always sure about the best way to treat this problem. This is especially true when the condition is mild. This review of past studies aimed to find out if surgery to remove the tissue is better than waiting to see if the problem gets worse. This information can help patients and doctors decide on the best plan for care.

### **Trial Design**
This report is a review of other medical studies. The researchers looked for studies that compared surgery to no treatment for epiretinal membrane. A good study for this would have put people into groups by chance. One group would get surgery, and the other would not.

The researchers only found one study that fit their search. This study included 53 adults who had a mild epiretinal membrane. Their vision was still quite good when the study started.

The study created two groups. One group had surgery to remove the tissue right away. The other group did what is called ""watchful waiting."" This means they did not have surgery at first. Doctors watched them closely, and they would only get surgery later if their vision got worse. Doctors checked on everyone in the study for one year.

### **Results**
After one year, there was not a big difference in vision between the two groups. The people who had surgery right away had slightly better vision. But this difference was very small.

The study did not find strong proof that surgery leads to a big improvement in sight. The good news was that no one in either group had a big loss of vision during the year. The study was generally safe. Only one person who had surgery developed some minor swelling in their eye.

The researchers who wrote this review had some final thoughts. They believe that for people with a severe eye problem, surgery is likely the best choice. But for people with a mild problem, waiting may be just as good as having surgery right away.

However, the researchers are not very sure about this. They only had one small study to look at. They said that we need more and better studies to be certain. Future studies should include more people and watch them for a longer time. They should also ask people how the treatment affects their daily life.","What are the benefits and risks of surgery for epiretinal membrane (a disease of the eye)? 
Why is this question important?An epiretinal membrane is an abnormal layer of tissue that develops at the back of the eye. It affects around one in five people aged 75 years and older. In most people, the development of an epiretinal membrane is linked to the normal ageing processes in the eye and is described as 'idiopathic'. In other instances, epiretinal membrane is caused by a pre‐existing condition affecting the retina, such as inflammation or poor circluation. Epiretinal membrane can also develop after eye surgery. 
Epiretinal membrane typically forms over the part of the eye responsible for seeing fine detail (the macula). In some people, this does not affect vision. In others, it causes distorted or blurred vision, which can affect people’s quality of life. For example, an epiretinal membrane may impair people’s ability to read or drive. 
If an epiretinal membrane affects vision, it is commonly removed by surgery. A local anaesthetic (medication) is used to numb the eye area. As with any procedure, this surgery carries risks of harm from side effects. These include potential problems such as cataract, detached retina, infection and bleeding in the eye. 
To understand when the benefits of surgery outweigh its risks, we reviewed the research evidence. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?First, we searched the medical literature for studies: 
‐ in which epiretinal membrane was not caused by a pre‐existing condition or surgery;
‐ that compared the effects of surgery against no surgery or a placebo (sham) procedure; and 
‐ where people were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a group that underwent surgery for epiretinal membrane, and a group that did not have surgery for epiretinal membrane. 
We then summarised the evidence and rated our confidence in it, based on factors such as study methods and size. 
What did we find?We found only one study that met our criteria. This study took place in Denmark and included 53 people who had epiretinal membranes causing mild impairment of sight. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Those in one group had immediate surgery. Those in the other group were watched closely and in the event of any deterioration in their condition were invited to have surgery. People in both groups were followed up for one year. 
The study results suggest that immediate surgery for epiretinal membrane causing mild impairment of sight: 
‐ may not benefit vision 12 months after surgery; and
‐ may not lead to serious unwanted effects. One person treated with immediate surgery experienced an unwanted effect that was not considered serious. This was the development of an eye condition caused by fluid building up at the back of the eye. 
The study did not investigate the impact of surgery on participants’ quality of life.
How confident are we in the evidence?We are not confident in the evidence, because: 
‐ it is based on one small study; and
‐ some of the methods used by the researchers who conducted it may have introduced errors in its results. 
What does this mean?For epiretinal membrane causing severe disabling impairment of sight, we found no carefully‐controlled study that measured the effect of surgery. For severe epiretinal membrane, surgery is widely considered to improve the outcome and is routine practice. A carefully controlled trial comparing surgery to no treatment is considered unecessary and ethically inappropriate. 
For epiretinal membrane causing mild impairment of sight, however, the effect of surgery is uncertain. There is some evidence that the outcome of watchful waiting may be as good as the effect of immediate surgery. However, the evidence is not strong enough to draw firm conclusions. Further studies that use robust methods and measure outcomes including quality of life in the longer term would help to determine effect of surgery with more confidence. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to May 2020.

Postoperative administration of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduces patient opioid requirements and, in turn, may reduce the incidence and severity of opioid‐induced adverse events (AEs). 
Objectives
To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of single‐dose intravenous (IV) ibuprofen, compared with placebo or an active comparator, for moderate‐to‐severe postoperative pain in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases without language restrictions: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS on 10 June 2021. We checked clinical trials registers and reference lists of retrieved articles for additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized trials that compared a single postoperative dose of intravenous (IV) ibuprofen with placebo or another active treatment, for treating acute postoperative pain in adults following any surgery. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently considered trials for review inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data.Our primary outcome was the number of participants in each arm achieving at least 50% pain relief over a 4‐ and 6‐hour period. 
Our secondary outcomes were time to, and number of participants using rescue medication; withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, adverse events (AEs), and for any other cause; and number of participants reporting or experiencing any AE, serious AEs (SAEs), and specific NSAID‐related or opioid‐related AEs. 
We were not able to carry out any planned meta‐analysis. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
Only one study met our inclusion criteria, involving 201 total participants, mostly female (mean age 42 years), undergoing primary, unilateral, distal, first metatarsal bunionectomy (with osteotomy and internal fixation). Ibuprofen 300 mg, placebo or acetaminophen 1000 mg was administered intravenously to participants reporting moderate pain intensity the day after surgery. Since we identified only one study for inclusion, we did not perform any quantitative analyses. The study was at low risk of bias for most domains. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to serious study limitations, indirectness and imprecision. 
Ibuprofen versus placebo 
Findings of the single study found that at both the 4‐hour and 6‐hour assessment period, the proportion of participants with at least 50% pain relief was 32% (24/76) for those assigned to ibuprofen and 22% (11/50) for those assigned to placebo. These findings produced a risk ratio (RR) of 1.44 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 2.66 versus placebo for at least 50% of maximum pain relief over the 4‐hour and 6‐hour period (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Median time to rescue medication was 101 minutes for ibuprofen and 71 minutes for placebo (1 study, 126 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The number of participants using rescue medication was not reported within the included study. 
During the study (1 study, 126 participants), 58/76 (76%) of participants assigned to ibuprofen and 39/50 (78%) assigned to placebo reported or experienced any adverse event (AE), (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.19; low‐certainty evidence). 
No serious AEs (SAEs) were experienced (1 study, 126 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Ibuprofen versus active comparators 
Ibuprofen (300 mg) was similar to the active comparator, IV acetaminophen (1000 mg) at 4 hours and 6 hours (1 study, 126 participants). For those assigned to active control (acetaminophen), the proportion of participants with at least 50% pain relief was 35% (26/75) at 4 hours and 31% (23/75) at 6 hours. At 4 hours, these findings produced a RR of 0.91 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.43; very low‐certainty evidence) versus active comparator (acetaminophen). At 6 hours, these findings produced a RR of 1.03 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.66; very low‐certainty evidence) versus active comparator (acetaminophen). 
Median time to rescue medication was 101 minutes for ibuprofen and 125 minutes for the active comparator, acetaminophen (1 study, 151 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The number of participants using rescue medication was not reported within the included study. 
During the study, 58/76 (76%) of participants assigned to ibuprofen and 45/75 (60%) assigned to active control (acetaminophen) reported or experienced any AE, (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.59; very low‐certainty evidence). 
No SAEs were experienced (1 study, 151 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the suggestion that IV ibuprofen is effective and safe for acute postoperative pain in adults.

### **Plain Title**

Pain Medicine After Surgery: Does Ibuprofen Given in a Vein Help?

### **Rationale**

**Why did we need this study?**

After you have surgery, it is common to feel pain. Doctors often give strong pain medicines called opioids to help. Opioids can work well for pain. But they can also cause problems. These problems are called side effects. They can make you feel sleepy, sick to your stomach, or constipated.

There are other kinds of pain drugs that are not opioids. One type is called an NSAID. Ibuprofen is a well-known NSAID. Doctors think that giving an NSAID like ibuprofen after surgery might help control pain. If it works, patients might need fewer opioids. This could lead to fewer side effects from the strong pain medicines.

Researchers wanted to find out if giving ibuprofen through a needle in a vein works well. They also wanted to know if it is safe for adults who have pain after surgery. This review looked for all the best studies to answer this important question.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked for all the past studies that had already been done on this topic. Their goal was to combine the results from many good studies. Combining studies can give a stronger and more reliable answer.

The researchers searched for studies that met specific rules. The studies had to compare ibuprofen given in a vein to either a placebo or another pain drug. A placebo is a fake treatment, like a salt-water shot. It has no medicine in it. This helps show if the real drug is the reason people feel better.

After a wide search, the researchers found only one study that met their rules.

This one study included 201 people who had surgery to fix a bunion on their foot. Most of the people in the study were women. Their average age was 42 years old. The day after their surgery, the people who had pain were put into one of three groups by chance.

*   One group got ibuprofen in a vein.
*   Another group got a different pain drug, acetaminophen, in a vein.
*   The last group got a placebo (the fake drug) in a vein.

Doctors then checked on the patients for the next 6 hours to see how much their pain improved.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

Because the researchers only found one small study, it is hard to be sure about the results. The proof from this single study is considered very weak.

**How did ibuprofen compare to a fake drug?**

The study compared ibuprofen to a placebo, which was a fake drug.

*   For pain relief, about 3 out of every 10 people who got ibuprofen said their pain was cut in half. About 2 out of every 10 people who got the fake drug said their pain was cut in half.
*   People who got ibuprofen waited a little longer before they needed to ask for more pain medicine.
*   There was no big difference in side effects. About 8 out of 10 people in both groups had a side effect, like feeling dizzy or sick. No one had any very serious side effects.

**How did ibuprofen compare to another pain drug?**

The study also compared ibuprofen to another common pain drug, acetaminophen.

*   Both drugs seemed to work about the same for pain. About 3 out of every 10 people in both groups had their pain cut in half.
*   People who got acetaminophen waited a bit longer before needing more pain medicine than those who got ibuprofen.
*   More people who got ibuprofen had side effects. About 8 out of 10 people in the ibuprofen group had a side effect. About 6 out of 10 people in the acetaminophen group had a side effect. Again, no one had any very serious side effects.

**What did the study authors conclude?**

The authors of this review concluded that there is not enough proof. We cannot say for sure that ibuprofen given in a vein helps with pain after surgery. We also cannot say for sure if it is safe.

The single study they found was too small to give a clear answer. The evidence we have is very weak. Because of this, we need more and better studies to truly understand if this treatment is a good choice for patients.","What are the benefits and risks of a single injection of ibuprofen (an anti‐inflammation medicine) for relieving short‐term pain after surgery in adults?  
Key messages 
‐ There is not enough evidence to determine whether intravenous (injection into a vein) ibuprofen is an effective treatment for adults with pain after surgery or if it can harm them.  
‐ It would be beneficial if future studies on this topic were well‐designed with a large number of patients to determine if ibuprofen is an effective treatment for the management of pain after surgery. 
‐ More evidence is required to establish if ibuprofen causes serious unwanted effects.
Treating short‐term pain after surgery 
Pain is common in the short term (within 6 hours) after surgery (postoperative pain). 
Non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, aspirin‐like drugs) are often delivered along with opioids (such as morphine) to treat this type of pain. However, NSAIDs can have side effects. NSAIDS (such as ibuprofen) may result in bleeding (e.g. at the site of an incision or wound) and may result in injury to the kidneys and gut.  
Patients need more and better treatment options to help manage short‐term pain after surgery. There is a lot of concern about using opioids to treat short‐term pain because of the risk that patients can develop unpleasant side effects or opioid over‐use disorder. It is therefore important to weigh the benefits and risks of NSAIDs when considering using them to reduce pain shortly after surgery. 
What did we want to find out? 
Ibuprofen is a NSAID that can be delivered intravenously. We wanted to know if intravenous ibuprofen (delivered by injection or drip) is a helpful treatment option to manage moderate‐to‐severe pain when patients cannot take medicines by mouth.  
What did we do? 
To make the comparison fair, patients in the studies must all have had the same random chance (like the flip of a coin) to receive the ibuprofen or the other treatment.  
We searched the medical literature (clinical studies) up to June 2021, where intravenous ibuprofen was used to treat pain after surgery in adults (aged over 18) and compared against: 
‐ a placebo (a control treatment, such as a bag of saline administered into a vein); or 
‐ another medicine.
What did we find? 
We found only one study which was suitable to include in our review. The study looked at the management of pain after bunionectomy. Bunionectomy is a surgery to remove a bunion at the base of the big toe. This study evaluated 201 people, mostly females. The study compared intravenous ibuprofen to: 
‐ a placebo; or
‐ another medicine, acetaminophen (paracetamol).
We were most interested in learning how many people had their pain reduced by 50% (half) or more within 4 or 6 hours of surgery.  
Pain reduction 
The study showed that:
‐ more people who received ibuprofen had their pain reduced by 50% (half) or more within 4 or 6 hours of surgery as compared to those who received placebo; and  
‐ there was little to no difference when ibuprofen was compared to another medicine, acetaminophen, i.e. the numbers of people with pain reduced by 50% (half) or more within 4 or 6 hours of surgery  
Need for extra pain medicines (rescue medication) 
Rescue medicine is an extra pain medication if the study medication is not treating the patient's pain well enough. The time (in minutes) to needing rescue medication was longer (delayed) with use of ibuprofen or acetaminophen than for those who received placebo.  
Adverse events 
There was not enough information in this study to assess side effects, but the rate at which they occurred appeared to be similar among all treatments. Very few patients dropped out because of side effects. This is usually the case in studies where patients are only in a study for a short period of time.  
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We only had results from one relatively small study. This limited our confidence in the evidence. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to June 2021.

Severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The definitive management for severe AS is aortic valve replacement (AVR). The choice of transcatheter approach versus open‐heart surgery for AVR in people with severe AS and low surgical risk remains a matter of debate. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) compared to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in people with severe AS and low surgical risk. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on 29 April 2019: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science Core Collection. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We searched all databases from inception to present and imposed no restriction on language or date of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs that compared TAVI and SAVR in adults (18 years of age or older) with severe AS and low surgical risk. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion, performed data extraction, and assessed risk of bias in the studies included. We analysed dichotomous data using the risk ratio (RR) and continuous data using the mean difference (MD), with respective 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. Our outcomes of interest were assessed in the short term (i.e. during hospitalisation and up to 30 days of follow‐up). Primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality, stroke, and rehospitalisation. Secondary outcomes were myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac death, length of hospital stay (LOS), permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation, new‐onset atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury (AKI), and any bleeding. 
Main results
We identified four studies (13 reports), with 2818 participants, and one ongoing study. Overall certainty of evidence ranged from high to very low. 
There is probably little or no difference between TAVI and SAVR for the following short‐term outcomes: all‐cause mortality (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.44; SAVR 11 deaths per 1000, TAVI 8 deaths per 1000 (95% CI 4 to 16); 2818 participants; 4 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence); stroke (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.25; SAVR 21 strokes per 1000, TAVI 16 strokes per 1000 (95% CI 9 to 27); 2818 participants; 4 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence); MI (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.58; SAVR 14 MI per 1000, TAVI 11 MI per 1000 (95% CI 6 to 21); 2748 participants; 3 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence); and cardiac death (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.56; SAVR 10 cardiac deaths per 1000, TAVI 7 cardiac deaths per 1000 (95% CI 3 to 16); 2818 participants; 4 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
TAVI may reduce the risk of short‐term rehospitalisation, although the confidence interval also includes the possibility of no difference in risk between groups (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.06; SAVR 30 cases per 1000, TAVI 19 cases per 1000 (95% CI 12 to 32); 2468 participants; 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence). 
TAVI, compared with SAVR, probably increases the risk of PPM implantation (RR 3.65, 95% CI 1.50 to 8.87; SAVR 47 per 1000, TAVI 170 cases per 1000 (95% CI 70 to 413); number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) = 7; 2683 participants; 3 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether TAVI, compared with SAVR, affects the LOS in days, although it appears to be associated with shorter LOS. 
TAVI, compared with SAVR, reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.30; 2683 participants; 3 studies), AKI (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.58; 2753 participants; 4 studies), and bleeding (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.62; 2753 participants; 4 studies) (all high‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Our meta‐analysis indicates that, in the short term, TAVI probably has little or no mortality difference compared to SAVR for severe AS in individuals with low surgical risk. Similarly, there is probably little or no difference in risk of stroke, MI, and cardiac death between the two approaches. TAVI may reduce the risk of rehospitalisation, but we are uncertain about the effects on LOS. TAVI reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation, AKI, and bleeding. However, this benefit is offset by the increased risk of PPM implantation. Long‐term follow‐up data are needed to further assess and validate these outcomes, especially durability, in the low surgical risk population.

Comparing a Newer, Less-Invasive Procedure with Open-Heart Surgery to Replace a Heart Valve

### **Rationale**

Your heart has four valves that act like one-way doors. They open and close with each heartbeat to keep blood flowing in the right direction. Sometimes, a key valve called the aortic valve becomes stiff and narrow. This condition is called aortic stenosis.

When the aortic valve is narrow, your heart has to work much harder to pump blood to the rest of your body. This can make you feel tired, dizzy, or short of breath. If it is not treated, severe aortic stenosis is a very serious health problem.

The main treatment is to replace the bad valve. For many years, the only way to do this was with open-heart surgery. This is called surgical aortic valve replacement, or SAVR. Now, doctors have a newer method that is less invasive. It is called transcatheter aortic valve implantation, or TAVI. With TAVI, doctors place a new valve using a thin tube, often through a blood vessel in the leg, without opening the chest.

For people who are at low risk of problems from surgery, doctors are not sure which treatment is better. Researchers did this study to compare the benefits and harms of TAVI and SAVR in this group of people.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new medical study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked for all the best studies that had already compared TAVI and SAVR. They combined the results from four large studies to get a stronger answer. This kind of study is called a review.

The studies included more than 2,800 adults who had severe aortic stenosis. All of these people were considered to be at low risk for problems from open-heart surgery. In each study, people were randomly chosen to get either TAVI or SAVR. This is the best way to fairly compare two treatments.

The researchers looked at what happened to people in the short term. This means they checked on people's health during their hospital stay and for up to 30 days after their procedure.

### **Results**

The study found that in the first 30 days, the two treatments were very similar for the most serious problems. There was little or no difference in the number of people who died or had a stroke or a heart attack between the two groups.

*   **Death:** For every 1000 people who had open-heart surgery (SAVR), about 11 died. For every 1000 people who had the less-invasive TAVI, about 8 died.
*   **Stroke:** For every 1000 people who had SAVR, about 21 had a stroke. For every 1000 people who had TAVI, about 16 had a stroke.

The TAVI procedure showed some clear benefits. People who had TAVI were less likely to have major bleeding. They were also less likely to have new kidney problems or a fast, uneven heartbeat. People who got TAVI may have also been less likely to need to go back to the hospital.

However, the TAVI procedure had one main downside. People who had TAVI were more likely to need a permanent pacemaker. A pacemaker is a small device put under the skin in the chest. It sends signals to the heart to help it beat at a normal, steady rate.

*   **Needing a Pacemaker:** For every 1000 people who had SAVR, about 47 needed a pacemaker. For TAVI, about 170 people out of 1000 needed one.

Based on these short-term results, the researchers concluded that TAVI is a good option for low-risk people with severe aortic stenosis. It has similar rates of survival and stroke compared to surgery. It also has some benefits like less bleeding. But this is balanced by a higher chance of needing a pacemaker. The researchers noted that we still need to learn more about how patients do many years after each procedure.","Transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus surgical aortic valve replacement in people with severe aortic stenosis and low surgical risk 
Review question 
Does transcatheter approach, compared to open‐heart surgery, for aortic valve replacement improve outcomes in people with severe aortic stenosis and low surgical risk? 
Background 
Aortic stenosis (AS) is the narrowing of the exit of the left ventricle of the heart (where the aorta begins). It typically gets worse over time. Its severity can be divided into mild, moderate, severe, and very severe; and it is distinguishable by ultrasound scan of the heart and other clinical features. Once it has become severe, treatment primarily involves surgery to replace the valve. An alternative approach is to use transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). This approach improves outcomes in individuals who are inoperable or at a high to intermediate risk for surgery. However, it remains unclear if TAVI is beneficial to those who have severe AS and are at a low surgical risk. 
Search Date 
The evidence is current to April 2019. We searched the literature and found a total of 3092 citations that were potentially relevant. After reviewing each of these, we found 13 published articles describing four clinical trials that could help us answer our question. 
Study characteristics 
The four clinical trials included 2818 participants who were randomly allocated to undergo either TAVI or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). The trials were multicentre and took place in Australia, Canada, France, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the USA, Denmark, and Sweden. 
Key Results 
Moderate‐certainty evidence from clinical trials shows that, in the short term (i.e. during hospitalisation and up to 30 days of follow‐up), there is probably little or no difference between TAVI compared with SAVR in risk of death due to any cause, stroke (insult to the brain), myocardial infarction (injury or death of heart muscle), or death due to cardiac causes (e.g. myocardial infarction or failure of the heart muscle pump). Low‐certainty evidence shows that TAVI may reduce the risk of rehospitalisation compared with SAVR. We are uncertain whether TAVI, compared with SAVR, affects the length of hospital stay, although it appears to be associated with shorter duration of hospitalisation. High‐certainty evidence shows that fewer people had atrial fibrillation (a type of irregular heart rhythm), acute kidney injury (insult to the kidney), and bleeding when they underwent TAVI, compared with SAVR. However, moderate‐certainty evidence shows that TAVI probably increases the risk of permanent pacemaker implantation (a device that is placed to artificially set the heart rhythm), compared with SAVR. 
Quality of the evidence 
We consider the overall quality of evidence to be moderate for most relevant outcomes (death, stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiac death, and risk of permanent pacemaker implantation), with the exception of rehospitalisation (low‐quality evidence) and length of hospital stay (very low quality evidence). The evidence for atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, and bleeding was of high quality.

Background 
Patients with incurable cancer often experience tiredness (fatigue) during cancer treatment. Psychological therapies may help to reduce this symptom. Tiredness in cancer patients receiving cancer treatment may be treated with psychological therapies aimed at influencing or changing thoughts, emotions, behaviours, social interactions, or a combination of these (e.g. cognitive‐behavioural therapies, supportive‐expressive group therapies). This review looked at how effective psychological therapies are in reducing tiredness in patients with incurable cancer receiving cancer treatment. 
Study characteristics 
In November 2016, we searched for clinical trials looking at psychological therapies in patients with incurable cancer receiving cancer treatment. We found 14 small studies of very low quality reporting data on tiredness outcomes, 12 of which provided data for analyses. A limited number (three studies) reported results about side effects; these studies investigated a psychological therapy combined with medication. 
Key findings 
Review authors found no support for the effectiveness of psychological therapies in reducing tiredness when assessed directly following the intervention. Very low‐quality evidence suggests that psychological therapies may improve physical functioning directly after the intervention and may improve tiredness at first follow‐up. Evidence shows no support for the effectiveness of psychosocial therapies in improving other domains of functioning. Limited evaluation of potential harm suggests no differences in side effects between patients receiving psychological therapy and those given usual care. Limited good quality evidence allows no conclusions on the use of psychological therapies in people with incurable cancer. Larger, high‐quality trials are needed to find out whether psychological therapies help reduce tiredness for people with incurable cancer during cancer treatment. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of study evidence using four levels: very low, low, moderate, and high. Very low‐quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High‐quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. Included studies had design problems and included a very small number of participants. Therefore, the quality of the evidence in this review is very low, and results of this review should be interpreted with caution.

Can Talk Therapy Help People with Incurable Cancer Feel Less Tired?

**Rationale**

People who have cancer that cannot be cured often feel very tired. This tiredness, also called fatigue, is a common problem during cancer treatment. It can make daily life very hard.

This study looked at a type of treatment called psychological therapy. This is a kind of talk therapy. It helps people manage their thoughts, feelings, and actions. Researchers wanted to know if this kind of therapy could help people with incurable cancer feel less tired.

Feeling tired all the time is a major burden for patients. Doctors and researchers are looking for safe ways to help. This study checked if talk therapy could be a good choice to reduce tiredness for these patients.

**Trial Design**

This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers did a review. This means they looked for and studied the results of past research. They wanted to bring all the information together to get a bigger picture.

The researchers searched for studies that were done before November 2016. They looked for studies about adults who had incurable cancer. All the people in these studies were getting cancer treatment and felt very tired.

The researchers found 14 small studies on this topic. They were able to use the information from 12 of these studies. Because the researchers only looked at past studies, people did not have to join a new study or spend any time in a clinic for this review.

**Results**

The researchers found no strong proof that talk therapy helps reduce tiredness right after the therapy ends.

The proof they found was of ""very low quality."" When proof is very low quality, it means we cannot be sure about the results. This happened because the studies the researchers looked at were very small. They also had problems with how they were designed.

There was a small hint that talk therapy might help in other ways. Some weak proof showed it might help people do their daily physical tasks better. It also might help with tiredness a little while after the therapy was over. But again, this proof was very weak. The therapy did not seem to help in other areas of life.

The researchers also looked for side effects, or bad effects, from the therapy. The few studies that checked for side effects found no difference between people who got talk therapy and those who did not.

In the end, the researchers could not make a clear decision. There is not enough good proof to say if talk therapy helps people with incurable cancer feel less tired. We need new studies that are much larger and better designed. These new studies will help us get a clear answer.","Psychological therapies to reduce tiredness in patients with incurable cancer

Fetal malposition (occipito‐posterior and persistent occipito‐transverse) in labour is associated with adverse maternal and infant outcomes. Whether use of maternal postures can improve these outcomes is unclear. This Cochrane Review of maternal posture in labour is one of two new reviews replacing a 2007 review of maternal postures in pregnancy and labour. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of specified maternal postures for women with fetal malposition in labour on maternal and infant morbidity compared to other postures.  
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (13 July 2021), and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or cluster‐RCTs conducted among labouring women with a fetal malposition confirmed by ultrasound or clinical examination, comparing a specified maternal posture with another posture. Quasi‐RCTs and cross‐over trials were not eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, risk of bias, and performed data extraction. We used mean difference (MD) for continuous variables, and risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous variables, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included eight eligible studies with 1766 women. 
All studies reported some form of random sequence generation but were at high risk of performance bias due to lack of blinding. There was a high risk of selection bias in one study, detection bias in two studies, attrition bias in two studies, and reporting bias in two studies. 
Hands and knees 
The use of hands and knees posture may have little to no effect on operative birth (average RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.50; 3 trials, 721 women; low‐certainty evidence) and caesarean section (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.87; 3 trials, 721 women; low‐certainty evidence) but the evidence is uncertain; and very uncertain for epidural use (average RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.31; 2 trials, 282 women; very low‐certainty evidence), instrumental vaginal birth (average RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.90; 3 trials, 721 women; very low‐certainty evidence), severe perineal tears (average RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.03 to 22.30; 2 trials, 586 women; very low‐certainty evidence), maternal satisfaction (average RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.54; 3 trials, 350 women; very low‐certainty evidence), and Apgar scores less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.34; 2 trials, 586 babies; very low‐certainty evidence).  
No data were reported for the hands and knees comparisons for postpartum haemorrhage, serious neonatal morbidity, death (stillbirth or death of liveborn infant), admission to neonatal intensive care, neonatal encephalopathy, need for respiratory support, and neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy.  
Lateral postures 
The use of lateral postures may have little to no effect on reducing operative birth (average RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.19; 4 trials, 871 women; low‐certainty evidence), caesarean section (average RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.39; 4 trials, 871 women; low‐certainty evidence), instrumental vaginal birth (average RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.36; 4 trials, 871 women; low‐certainty evidence), and maternal satisfaction (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09; 2 trials, 451 women; low‐certainty evidence), but the evidence is uncertain. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of lateral postures on severe perineal tears (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.48; 3 trials, 609 women; very low‐certainty evidence), postpartum haemorrhage (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.70; 1 trial, 322 women; very low‐certainty evidence), serious neonatal morbidity (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.12; 3 trials, 752 babies; very low‐certainty evidence), Apgar scores less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.24; 1 trial, 322 babies; very low‐certainty evidence), admissions to neonatal intensive care (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.12; 2 trials, 542 babies; very low‐certainty evidence) and neonatal death (stillbirth or death of liveborn) (1 trial, 210 women and their babies; no events).  
For the lateral posture comparisons, no data were reported for epidural use, neonatal encephalopathy, need for respiratory support, and neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy. We were not able to estimate the outcome death (stillbirth or death of liveborn infant) due to no events (1 trial, 210 participants).  
Authors' conclusions
We found low‐ and very low‐certainty evidence which indicated that the use of hands and knees posture or lateral postures in women in labour with a fetal malposition may have little or no effect on health outcomes of the mother or her infant. If a woman finds the use of hands and knees or lateral postures in labour comfortable there is no reason why they should not choose to use them. Further research is needed on the use of hands and knees and lateral postures for women with a malposition in labour. Trials should include further assessment of semi‐prone postures, same‐side‐as‐fetus lateral postures with or without hip hyperflexion, or both, and consider interventions of longer duration or that involve the early second stage of labour.

### **Plain Title**

Can certain positions during labor help when the baby is not in the best spot for birth?

### **Rationale**

For a baby to be born easily, it helps if they are in the best position in the mother’s womb. The best position is usually head-down, facing the mother's back. Sometimes, a baby is in a different, more difficult position. For example, the baby might be facing the mother’s front, which is sometimes called “sunny-side up.”

When a baby is in a tricky position, it can make labor longer and harder. It may increase the chance that the mother needs help to deliver the baby. This help could be a C-section surgery or the use of special tools. These things can create more risks for the mother and the baby.

Some people believe that the mother changing her position during labor might help. They think that getting on hands and knees or lying on one side could give the baby more space to turn into a better position for birth. Researchers wanted to find out if this is true. They looked at all the past studies on this topic to see if these positions really make a difference.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, the researchers did a review. They gathered all the best medical studies that had already been done on this topic. By looking at all the results together, they hoped to find a clearer answer.

The researchers found 8 different studies to include in their review. These studies involved a total of about 1,766 women from around the world. All the women in these studies were in labor, and a doctor or a scan had shown that their baby was in a tricky position for birth.

In each of the original studies, women were randomly put into groups. Women in one group were asked to use a specific position for some time during their labor. These positions were either on their hands and knees or lying on their side. The women in the other group did not use these specific positions. The researchers then compared what happened to the mothers and babies in each group.

### **Results**

After looking at all the studies, the researchers found that using these special positions may have little to no effect on the birth. The information from the studies was not very strong. This means that the researchers are not very sure about these results.

For women who used the hands and knees position, there did not seem to be a change in their chances of needing a C-section or other help during birth. The same was true for women who were asked to lie on their side. These positions also did not seem to change other things, like the baby's health right after birth or how satisfied the mother was with her experience.

The main conclusion is that we do not have strong proof that using these positions can fix a baby's tricky position during labor. More and better research is needed to know for sure. However, the study also found no proof that these positions cause any harm. Therefore, if a woman in labor finds it comfortable to be on her hands and knees or to lie on her side, there is no reason she should not use those positions.","Mothers' positions in labour when baby is lying 'back‐to‐back'
What is the issue? 
Malposition is when the back of the baby's head lies towards the mother's back. As a result, labour and birth can be long and difficult, sometimes resulting in an operative birth (where the baby is delivered by caesarean section or with special tools to help the baby through the birth canal) and more perineal trauma (damage to the pelvic floor). The baby may be more likely to go to a neonatal care unit. Also, women may experience stress or disappointment with the birth experience.  
Why is this important? 
The way a pregnant woman is positioned during labour may help rotate a baby so that the back of the baby's head lies towards the front of the mother's abdomen. This improved position may help the mother and baby have a more normal labour and birth. However, it is not yet known which posture, if any, is effective and when is the best time to use it. 
A systematic review of studies of positions (postures) used by women in labour with a baby in a malposition can provide answers on whether the postures improve birth and other health outcomes for mothers and babies. The summary of this review can be used to update clinical practice guidelines. 
A Cochrane Review in 2007 reported that the use of the 'hands and knees' posture in labour was ineffective for malposition, but it did reduce labouring women's backache. Since then, more trials have been conducted, some using other postures; these need evaluating to see if those postures work. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence (published to 13 July 2021) and identified eight studies  in nine different countries involving 1766 women and their babies. Women in the included studies were either first‐time mothers or mothers who had birthed before. All the women's  pregnancies were at least at 36 weeks.  
The trials compared use of 'hands and knees' posture or 'side‐lying' (lateral) postures (lying on the same side as the baby, lying on the opposite side to the baby, and lying semi‐prone) to other postures (free posture, lying on back, leaning back, lying on the same side as the baby).  
For both the hands and knees posture and side‐lying positions during labour, there may be little or no difference in the numbers of operative births, haemorrhage (profuse bleeding of the mother), severe perineal trauma, and women's satisfaction with their labour and delivery, but there was insufficient evidence to be sure. Many of our outcomes of interest were not reported in the included studies. 
Overall, we have little to no confidence in the evidence, mainly because there were too few women and babies in the studies, and some studies used unclear methods. 
What does this mean? 
Overall, it is uncertain whether hands and knees or side‐lying positions in labour improve the health of mother and baby when a baby is in a malposition. However, if women find the use of hands and knees, side‐lying, or other postures in labour comfortable, there is no reason why they should not choose to use them. 
Further research is needed to enable optimal fetal positioning. In particular, further research is needed on variations in the postures, the impact of longer use of these postures during labour, and on long‐term outcomes for women and their babies.

Governments and health systems are increasingly using mobile devices to communicate with patients and the public. Targeted digital client communication is when the health system transmits information to particular individuals or groups of people, based on their health or demographic status. Common types of targeted client communication are text messages that remind people to go to appointments or take their medicines. Other types include phone calls, interactive voice response, or multimedia messages that offer healthcare information, advice, monitoring, and support. 
Objectives
To explore clients' perceptions and experiences of targeted digital communication via mobile devices on topics related to reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, or adolescent health (RMNCAH). 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), MEDLINE In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations (OvidSP), Embase (Ovid), World Health Organization Global Health Library, and POPLINE databases for eligible studies from inception to 3‐6 July 2017 dependant on the database (See appendix 2). 
Selection criteria
We included studies that used qualitative methods for data collection and analysis; that explored clients' perceptions and experiences of targeted digital communication via mobile device in the areas of RMNCAH; and were from any setting globally. 
Data collection and analysis
We used maximum variation purposive sampling for data synthesis, employing a three‐step sampling frame. We conducted a framework thematic analysis using the Supporting the Use of Research Evidence (SURE) framework as our starting point. We assessed our confidence in the findings using the GRADE‐CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach. We used a matrix approach to explore whether potential implementation barriers identified in our synthesis had been addressed in the trials included in the related Cochrane Reviews of effectiveness. 
Main results
We included 35 studies, from a wide range of countries on six continents. Nineteen studies were conducted in low‐ and middle‐income settings and sixteen in high‐income settings. Some of the studies explored the views of people who had experienced the interventions, whereas others were hypothetical in nature, asking what people felt they would like from a digital health intervention. The studies covered a range of digital targeted client communication, for example medication or appointment reminders, prenatal health information, support for smoking cessation while pregnant, or general sexual health information. 
Our synthesis showed that clients' experiences of these types of programmes were mixed. Some felt that these programmes provided them with feelings of support and connectedness, as they felt that someone was taking the time to send them messages (moderate confidence in the evidence). They also described sharing the messages with their friends and family (moderate confidence). 
However, clients also pointed to problems when using these programmes. Some clients had poor access to cell networks and to the internet (high confidence). Others had no phone, had lost or broken their phone, could not afford airtime, or had changed their phone number (moderate confidence). Some clients, particularly women and teenagers, had their access to phones controlled by others (moderate confidence). The cost of messages could also be a problem, and many thought that messages should be free of charge (high confidence). Language issues as well as skills in reading, writing, and using mobile phones could also be a problem (moderate confidence). 
Clients dealing with stigmatised or personal health conditions such as HIV, family planning, or abortion care were also concerned about privacy and confidentiality (high confidence). Some clients suggested strategies to deal with these issues, such as using neutral language and tailoring the content, timing, and frequency of messages (high confidence). 
Clients wanted messages at a time and frequency that was convenient for them (moderate confidence). They had preferences for different delivery channels (e.g. short message service (SMS) or interactive voice response) (moderate confidence). They also had preferences about message content, including new knowledge, reminders, solutions, and suggestions about health issues (moderate confidence). Clients' views about who sent the digital health communication could influence their views of the programme (moderate confidence). 
For an overview of the findings and our confidence in the evidence, please see the 'Summary of qualitative findings' tables. 
Our matrix shows that many of the trials assessing these types of programmes did not try to address the problems we identified, although this may have been a reporting issue. 
Authors' conclusions
Our synthesis identified several factors that can influence the successful implementation of targeted client communication programmes using mobile devices. These include barriers to use that have equity implications. Programme planners should take these factors into account when designing and implementing programmes. Future trial authors also need to actively address these factors and to report their efforts in their trial publications.

### **Plain Title**
Learning from People's Views on Health Messages Sent to Their Phones

### **Rationale**
Health groups and doctors often send messages to people’s cell phones. These messages can help people with their health. They can remind you of an appointment. They can also remind you to take your medicine. This study looked at messages about health topics for women, babies, children, and teens.

We wanted to learn how people feel about getting these health messages. We wanted to know what they liked and what problems they had. Knowing this is important. It helps health groups create programs that are easy to use and helpful for everyone. We can make sure that these phone programs work well for all people.

### **Trial Design**
This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, our team looked at research that was already finished. This is called a review. We searched for studies that asked people for their thoughts and feelings about getting health messages on their phones.

We found 35 studies to look at. These studies came from many different countries all over the world. Some were from countries with less money, and some were from countries with more money. The studies included the views of many different people. They talked about their real experiences with phone message programs.

### **Results**
We found that people had both good and bad things to say about health messages on their phones.

**What worked well?**

Many people felt that the messages were very helpful. The messages made them feel supported and cared for. They felt like someone was looking out for their health. People also said they often shared the helpful messages with their friends and family. This helped spread good health information to more people.

**What were the problems?**

People also faced many problems. Some people did not have good phone service or a way to get on the internet. Others did not have a phone, or their phone was lost or broken. Some people could not afford to pay for phone minutes or data.

For some people, privacy was a big worry. This was true for personal health topics like family planning or HIV. They were afraid that other people might see their private messages. For some women and teens, another person controlled their phone. This made it very hard to get personal health messages safely. People also said that messages should be free.

**What did people want?**

People had good ideas to make the programs better. They wanted to be able to choose when and how often they got messages. They also wanted the messages to use simple words that were not easy for others to guess the topic. Using private language could help them feel safer.

Our team learned that health programs must think about these problems. If they do not, the programs might not be fair for everyone. Planners need to think about cost, privacy, and ease of use. This will help make sure that phone message programs help everyone who needs them.","What are clients' experiences and perceptions of receiving health information via their mobile phones? 
What is the aim of this synthesis? 
The aim of this Cochrane qualitative evidence synthesis was to explore clients' views and experiences of being communicated with by the health system through their mobile phone. Our synthesis looked at communication about pregnancy, newborn, and child health, sexual health, and family planning. By synthesis we mean the bringing together and synthesising of results from primary qualitative studies into a larger whole. We collected all relevant studies and included 35 studies in the synthesis. 
This synthesis links to other Cochrane Reviews that assess the effectiveness of this type of targeted digital health communication. 
Key messages 
Many clients like receiving messages from the health services by mobile phone. However, some clients have problems receiving messages due to lack of network access, internet, or phone, or language, reading, or privacy issues. Clients' experiences are also influenced by message timing, frequency, content, and sender. 
What did we study in the synthesis? 
Governments and health systems are starting to use mobile phones to communicate with clients. When the information is targeted at particular people or groups of people, and when the health system decides when and what to communicate, this is called 'digital targeted client communication.' Common types of digital targeted client communication are text messages that remind people to go to appointments or to take their medicines. Other types include phone calls or video messages that offer healthcare information, advice, monitoring, and support. 
We looked for studies of clients' views and experiences of targeted communication by mobile phone. We focused on communication with pregnant women and parents of young children, and with adults and teenagers about sexual health and family planning. 
What are the main findings of the synthesis? 
We included 35 studies from around the world. These studies showed that clients' experiences of these types of programmes were mixed. Some felt that these programmes provided them with feelings of support and connectedness, as they felt that someone was taking the time to send them messages (moderate confidence in the evidence). Others also described sharing the messages with their friends and family (moderate confidence). 
However, clients also pointed to problems when using these programmes. Some clients had poor access to cell networks and to the internet (high confidence). Others had no phone, had lost or broken their phone, could not afford airtime, or had changed their phone number (moderate confidence). Some clients, particularly women and teenagers, had their access to phones controlled by others (moderate confidence). The cost of messages could also be a problem, and many thought that messages should be free of charge (high confidence). Languages issues as well as clients' skills in reading, writing, and using mobile phones could also be a problem (moderate confidence). 
Clients dealing with stigmatised or personal health conditions such as HIV, family planning, or abortion care were concerned about privacy and confidentiality (high confidence). Some suggested strategies to deal with these issues, such as using neutral language and tailoring the content, timing, and frequency of messages (high confidence). 
Clients wanted messages at a time and frequency that was convenient for them (moderate confidence). They had preferences for different delivery channels (e.g. short message service (SMS) or interactive voice response) (moderate confidence). They also had preferences about message content, including new knowledge, reminders, solutions, and suggestions about health issues (moderate confidence). Clients' views about who sent the digital health communication could influence their views of the programme, and many people wanted a sender that they knew and trusted (moderate confidence).

Hypoglycaemia is a common occurrence in people with diabetes but can also result from an imbalance in glucose homeostasis in the absence of diabetes. The best enteral route for glucose administration for suspected hypoglycaemia in a first aid situation is unknown. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of first aid glucose administration by any route appropriate for use by first‐aid providers (buccal, sublingual, oral, rectal) for symptomatic hypoglycaemia. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL as well as grey literature (records identified in the WHO ICTRP Search Portal, ClinicalTrials.gov and the EU Clinical Trials Register) up to July 2018. We searched reference lists of included studies retrieved by the above searches. 
Selection criteria
We included studies involving adults and children with documented or suspected hypoglycaemia as well as healthy volunteers, in which glucose was administered by any enteral route appropriate for use by first‐aid providers. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias, extracted data and evaluated trials for overall certainty of the evidence using the GRADE instrument. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess the risk of bias in the randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and the 'risk of bias In non‐randomised studies of interventions' (ROBINS‐I) tool, in addition to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions recommendations on cross‐over studies, for the non‐RCTs. We reported continuous outcomes as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% CIs. All data on glucose concentrations were converted to mg/dL. We contacted authors of included studies to obtain missing data. 
Main results
From 6394 references, we included four studies evaluating 77 participants, including two RCTs, studying children and adults with hypoglycaemia, respectively, and two non‐RCTs with healthy volunteers. The studies included three different routes of glucose administration (sublingual, buccal and a combination of oral and buccal administration). All studies had a high risk of bias in one or more 'Risk of bias' domain. 
Glucose administration by the sublingual route, in the form of table sugar under the tongue, resulted in a higher blood glucose concentration after 20 minutes compared with the oral route in the very specific setting of children with hypoglycaemia and symptoms of concomitant malaria or respiratory tract infection (MD 17 mg/dL, 95% CI 4.4 to 29.6; P = 0.008; 1 study; 42 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Resolution of hypoglycaemia at 80 minutes may favour sublingual administration (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.54; P = 0.006; 1 study; 42 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), but no substantial difference could be demonstrated at 20 minutes (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.74; P = 0.16; 1 study; 42 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A decrease in the time to resolution of hypoglycaemia was found in favour of sublingual administration (MD ‐51.5 min, 95% CI ‐58 to ‐45; P < 0.001; 1 study; 42 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No adverse events were reported in either group. No data were available for resolution of symptoms and time to resolution of symptoms, and treatment delay. 
Glucose administered by the buccal route in one study resulted in a lower plasma glucose concentration after 20 minutes compared with oral administration (MD ‐14.4 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐17.5 to ‐11.4 for an imputed within‐participants correlation coefficient of 0.9; P < 0.001; 1 trial; 16 participants; very low‐quality evidence). In another study there were fewer participants with increased blood glucose at 20 minutes favouring oral glucose (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.98; P = 0.05; 1 study; 7 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No data were available for resolution of symptoms and time to resolution of symptoms, resolution of hypoglycaemia and time to resolution of hypoglycaemia, adverse events, and treatment delay. 
For the combined oral and buccal mucosal route (in the form of a dextrose gel) the MD was ‐15.3 mg/dL, 95%CI ‐33.6 to 3; P = 0.09; 1 study; 18 participants; very low‐quality evidence . No improvement was identified for either route in the resolution of symptoms at 20 minutes or less following glucose administration (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.14; P = 0.08; 1 study; 18 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No data were available for time to resolution of symptoms, resolution of hypoglycaemia and time to resolution of hypoglycaemia, adverse events, and treatment delay. 
Authors' conclusions
When providing first aid to individuals with hypoglycaemia, oral glucose administration results in a higher blood glucose concentrations after 20 minutes when compared with buccal administration of glucose. A difference in plasma glucose concentration could not be demonstrated, when administering a dextrose gel, defined as “a combined oral and buccal mucosal route” compared to oral administration of a glucose tablet or solution. In the specific population of children with concomitant malaria and respiratory illness, sublingual sugar results in a higher blood glucose concentration after 20 minutes when compared with oral administration.These results need to be interpreted cautiously because our confidence in the body of evidence is very low due to the low number of participants and studies as well as methodological deficiencies in the included studies.

What is the Best Way to Give Sugar for Low Blood Sugar?

### **Rationale**

Our bodies need sugar for energy. This sugar is called glucose. It travels in our blood to all parts of our body. Sometimes, the amount of sugar in our blood can get too low. This is called low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia.

When blood sugar is low, a person can feel shaky, weak, or confused. If it gets very low, it can be dangerous. People with diabetes often get low blood sugar. But it can happen to anyone.

When someone has low blood sugar, giving them sugar quickly is a type of first aid. Sugar can be given in a few ways. A person can drink a sugary liquid. They can also have sugar put under their tongue or inside their cheek. Researchers wanted to find out which of these ways works best and fastest in a first aid situation. This study was needed to help first aid providers know the best way to help someone with low blood sugar.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers looked for all the studies that had already been done on this topic. This is called a review. They gathered all the information from these past studies to find an answer to their question.

The researchers found four studies to look at. In total, these studies included 77 people. The people in the studies were children and adults. Some of them had low blood sugar. Others were healthy people who took part in the research.

The studies they found looked at different ways of giving sugar for first aid. They compared giving sugar to drink with:
*   Placing sugar under the tongue.
*   Placing sugar inside the cheek.
*   Using a sugar gel in the mouth and cheek.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The researchers found that the best way to give sugar might depend on the situation. But they want everyone to be careful about these results. The studies they looked at were very small and had some problems in how they were done. This means the proof we have is not very strong.

Here is what they found for each method:

**Sugar Under the Tongue**
One study looked at sick children who had low blood sugar. For these children, putting table sugar under the tongue worked better than giving them a sugary drink. Their blood sugar level was higher after 20 minutes. Their low blood sugar also went away faster. No bad side effects were reported.

**Sugar in the Cheek**
Two studies looked at putting sugar inside the cheek. This did not work as well as giving sugar to drink. People who got sugar in the cheek had lower blood sugar levels after 20 minutes compared to those who drank a sugar solution.

**Sugar Gel in the Mouth and Cheek**
One study looked at a sugar gel. The gel did not seem to work better or worse than a sugar drink or tablet. There was no real difference between the two methods.

**Conclusions from the Researchers**
Based on this review, giving sugar by mouth in a drink or tablet seems to raise blood sugar better than putting sugar in the cheek. For the special group of sick children, putting sugar under the tongue seemed to work best.

The researchers stress that we need more and better studies to be sure about these results. Because the studies were so small, the proof is of very low quality. More research will help us find the best way to give first aid for low blood sugar.","First aid glucose administration routes for symptomatic hypoglycaemia
Review question 
We examined the effects of various routes of glucose administration as a first‐aid treatment in people with suspected or symptomatic hypoglycaemia. 
Background 
Hypoglycaemia, or having low blood sugar levels, is a common occurrence in people with diabetes but may also occur in other persons due to an imbalance in blood sugar regulation. Symptoms of mild or moderate hypoglycaemia are for example, shakiness, dizziness, sweating or nervousness, First aid for this condition is usually self‐administered but is often provided by family or friends, and glucose tablets compared with dietary forms of sugar such as juice, candies or dried fruit strips have shown to result in a better resolution of symptoms. Glucose can be given orally (swallowed), but also inside the cheek against the buccal mucosa (‘buccal administration’), under the tongue (‘sublingual administration’) or via the rectal route. In the latter three ways of treatment, the glucose is not being swallowed as with the oral route. 
Study characteristics 
We identified four studies. One randomised study (clinical trials where people are randomly allocated to one of two or more treatment groups) compared sublingual glucose administration, in the form of table sugar, with an oral administration in 42 hypoglycaemic children between one and 15 years old. Two non‐randomised studies compared buccal glucose administration with oral administration in 23 adult healthy fasting volunteers. One randomised study compared a dextrose gel with oral administration of glucose in 18 people with type 1 diabetes and hypoglycaemia. 
Key results 
Providing sugar under the tongue (sublingual) resulted in a greater rise in blood glucose after 20 minutes than giving the sugar orally, but this was in a specific setting including children with hypoglycaemia and symptoms of concomitant malaria or respiratory tract infection. On the other hand, giving glucose by the buccal mucosa route resulted in a lower plasma glucose concentration than with the oral route. For dextrose gel (where uptake of the glucose occurs through a combination of oral swallowing and via the buccal mucosa), no clear benefit was shown compared to oral glucose administration (glucose tablets or glucose solutions). Most studies did not report on time to resolution of symptoms, resolution of hypoglycaemia as defined by blood glucose levels above a certain threshold, time to resolution of hypoglycaemia, adverse events, and treatment delay. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The evidence is of very low certainty due to limitations in study design, few studies and small number of participants in the studies, and because half of the studies were performed with healthy volunteers rather than in people with characteristic hypoglycaemia.

Background 
People with cystic fibrosis often suffer from repeated chest infections and eventually their lungs become permanently infected by bacteria, such as a family of bacteria called Burkholderia cepacia complex which can cause problems because many antibiotics do not work against them and they can cause a quicker deterioration in lung disease.

This review included one study of 100 people aged between 6 and 57 years old. The study compared an inhaled antibiotic called aztreonam to placebo (a substance which contains no medication) and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly (by chance). The study lasted 52 weeks. 
Key results 
The only study included in this review found inhaled aztreonam had no beneficial effect on lung function or rates of chest infections in people with cystic fibrosis and Burkholderia cepacia complex infection. There was no difference between groups in relation to the average time to the next exacerbation or the number of people hospitalised for an exacerbation. Overall adverse events were similar between groups and with regards to other outcomes assessed, there was no difference between treatment groups for mortality, quality of life or sputum density. More research is needed to establish if other inhaled antibiotics may be useful.

### **Plain Title**

A Study of an Inhaled Antibiotic for a Lung Infection in People with Cystic Fibrosis

### **Rationale**

Cystic fibrosis is a health problem that affects the lungs. People with cystic fibrosis often get lung infections. These infections can damage the lungs over time.

Sometimes, a group of germs called *Burkholderia cepacia* can cause a serious lung infection. This type of germ is very hard to treat. Many common antibiotic medicines do not work against it. This infection can make lung problems get worse more quickly. This is a heavy burden for people who have it.

Researchers wanted to find a good treatment for this infection. They decided to study an antibiotic medicine called aztreonam. People breathe this medicine directly into their lungs. The researchers hoped this medicine would fight the germs and help people breathe better. This study was needed to see if long-term use of aztreonam was safe and helpful for people with this tough infection.

### **Trial Design**

This summary is about one study. The study included 100 people who had cystic fibrosis and a *Burkholderia cepacia* infection. The people in the study were between 6 and 57 years old.

The study had two groups. People were put into one of the two groups by chance, like flipping a coin. One group used an inhaler to breathe in the real medicine, aztreonam. The other group used an inhaler with a placebo. A placebo looks like the real medicine but has no drug in it.

Using a placebo helps researchers know for sure if the real medicine is causing any changes. By comparing the two groups, they can see if the drug really works. No one in the study knew who was getting the real medicine and who was getting the placebo. The study lasted for one year.

### **Results**

The study found that the inhaled medicine aztreonam did not help people with this type of lung infection.

People who took the medicine did not have better lung function than people who took the placebo. The medicine also did not lower the number of serious chest infections. Both groups had about the same number of hospital stays for their lung problems. The side effects from the treatment were similar for people in both groups. The medicine also did not improve how people felt about their quality of life.

The researchers learned that this medicine may not be the right choice for this tough lung infection. This was an important finding because it helps doctors and patients make better treatment choices. The researchers concluded that more studies are needed. Future research can test other antibiotic medicines to find one that can help people with this infection.","Antibiotic treatments for long‐term Burkholderia cepacia infections in people with cystic fibrosis

10.1002-14651858.CD013194,"Background
Melanoma has one of the fastest rising incidence rates of any cancer. It accounts for a small percentage of skin cancer cases but is responsible for the majority of skin cancer deaths. History‐taking and visual inspection of a suspicious lesion by a clinician is usually the first in a series of ‘tests’ to diagnose skin cancer. Establishing the accuracy of visual inspection alone is critical to understating the potential contribution of additional tests to assist in the diagnosis of melanoma. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection for the detection of cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants in adults with limited prior testing and in those referred for further evaluation of a suspicious lesion. Studies were separated according to whether the diagnosis was recorded face‐to‐face (in‐person) or based on remote (image‐based) assessment. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: CENTRAL; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated visual inspection in adults with lesions suspicious for melanoma, compared with a reference standard of either histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up. We excluded studies reporting data for ‘clinical diagnosis’ where dermoscopy may or may not have been used. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). We contacted authors of included studies where information related to the target condition or diagnostic threshold were missing. We estimated summary sensitivities and specificities per algorithm and threshold using the bivariate hierarchical model. We investigated the impact of: in‐person test interpretation; use of a purposely developed algorithm to assist diagnosis; and observer expertise. 
Main results
We included 49 publications reporting on a total of 51 study cohorts with 34,351 lesions (including 2499 cases), providing 134 datasets for visual inspection. Across almost all study quality domains, the majority of study reports provided insufficient information to allow us to judge the risk of bias, while in three of four domains that we assessed we scored concerns regarding applicability of study findings as 'high'. Selective participant recruitment, lack of detail regarding the threshold for deciding on a positive test result, and lack of detail on observer expertise were particularly problematic. 
Attempts to analyse studies by degree of prior testing were hampered by a lack of relevant information and by the restricted inclusion of lesions selected for biopsy or excision. Accuracy was generally much higher for in‐person diagnosis compared to image‐based evaluations (relative diagnostic odds ratio of 8.54, 95% CI 2.89 to 25.3, P < 0.001). Meta‐analysis of in‐person evaluations that could be clearly placed on the clinical pathway showed a general trade‐off between sensitivity and specificity, with the highest sensitivity (92.4%, 95% CI 26.2% to 99.8%) and lowest specificity (79.7%, 95% CI 73.7% to 84.7%) observed in participants with limited prior testing (n = 3 datasets). Summary sensitivities were lower for those referred for specialist assessment but with much higher specificities (e.g. sensitivity 76.7%, 95% CI 61.7% to 87.1%) and specificity 95.7%, 95% CI 89.7% to 98.3%) for lesions selected for excision, n = 8 datasets). These differences may be related to differences in the spectrum of included lesions, differences in the definition of a positive test result, or to variations in observer expertise. We did not find clear evidence that accuracy is improved by the use of any algorithm to assist diagnosis in all settings. Attempts to examine the effect of observer expertise in melanoma diagnosis were hindered due to poor reporting.

Visual inspection is a fundamental component of the assessment of a suspicious skin lesion; however, the evidence suggests that melanomas will be missed if visual inspection is used on its own. The evidence to support its accuracy in the range of settings in which it is used is flawed and very poorly reported. Although published algorithms do not appear to improve accuracy, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the ‘no algorithm’ approach should be preferred in all settings. Despite the volume of research evaluating visual inspection, further prospective evaluation of the potential added value of using established algorithms according to the prior testing or diagnostic difficulty of lesions may be warranted.

### **Plain Title**

How Good Are Doctors at Spotting Skin Cancer Just by Looking?

### **Rationale**

Melanoma is a serious type of skin cancer. More and more people are getting it each year. Even though it is not the most common skin cancer, it causes the most deaths from skin cancer. Finding it early is very important.

Usually, the first step to find skin cancer is a visit to a doctor. A person may have a new or strange-looking spot on their skin. The doctor will look closely at this spot. This is called a visual inspection.

This study was done to learn how well this first step works on its own. The researchers wanted to know if doctors can tell if a spot is cancer just by looking at it. Knowing this helps us understand if other tests are needed to find skin cancer and save lives.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a study with new patients. Instead, the researchers looked at the results from many past studies. This is called a review. It helps to bring all the information from old studies together in one place.

The researchers looked for studies that were done up to the year 2016. These studies included adults who had skin spots that looked worrying. In these studies, doctors had to decide if a spot was skin cancer just by looking at it. Sometimes they saw the person in their office. Other times, they only looked at a photo of the skin spot.

To know if the doctors were right, the old studies compared their guesses to a lab test. A lab test is the best way to know for sure if a spot is cancer. For a lab test, a doctor removes a small piece of the spot. This piece is then checked very closely under a microscope.

### **Results**

The researchers found 49 past studies to review. In total, these studies looked at more than 34,000 skin spots on many different people. About 2,500 of these spots turned out to be cancer.

A main finding was that it was much better for a doctor to see the spot in person. Doctors who only looked at a photo of a spot were not as good at telling if it was cancer.

The results also showed a trade-off in how doctors make decisions. There are two important ways to measure a test:
*   One is how well it finds the cancer when it is really there.
*   The other is how well it knows a spot is healthy when it is not cancer.

The study found that when doctors were very good at finding almost every cancer, they also made more mistakes. They would sometimes think a healthy spot was cancer. This could lead to worry and unneeded tests. For example, in one group of studies, doctors found more than 9 out of 10 cancers. But they also wrongly flagged about 2 out of 10 healthy spots as being cancer.

When doctors were very good at not making mistakes with healthy spots, they sometimes missed a real cancer. For example, in another group of studies, doctors correctly identified more than 9 out of 10 healthy spots. But in that group, they only found about 8 out of 10 cancers.

The researchers also looked to see if using checklists helped doctors. These checklists have rules on what to look for, like the spot’s size, shape, or color. They found that using these checklists did not seem to make doctors better at spotting cancer.

**What this means for patients:**

The people who did this review concluded that a doctor looking at your skin is a very important first step. However, it is not enough on its own. If this is the only test used, some skin cancers will be missed. More research is needed to find the best way to use visual checks with other tests to find skin cancer early.","How accurate is visual inspection of skin lesions with the naked eye for diagnosis of melanoma in adults? 
What is the aim of the review? 
Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer. The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate checking suspicious skin lesions (lumps, bumps, wounds, scratches or grazes) with the naked eye (visual inspection) can be to diagnose melanoma (diagnostic accuracy). The Review also investigated whether diagnostic accuracy was different depending on whether the clinician was face to face with the patient (in‐person visual inspection), or looked at an image of the lesion (image‐based visual inspection). Cochrane researchers included 19 studies to answer this question. 
Why is it important to know the diagnostic accuracy of visual examination of skin lesions suspected to be melanomas? 
Not recognising a melanoma when it is present (a false‐negative test result) delays surgery to remove it (excision), risking cancer spreading to other organs in the body and possibly death. Diagnosing a skin lesion (a mole or area of skin with an unusual appearance in comparison with the surrounding skin) as a melanoma when it is not (a false‐positive result) may result in unnecessary surgery, further investigations, and patient anxiety. Visual inspection of suspicious skin lesions by a clinician using the naked eye is usually the first of a series of ‘tests’ to diagnose melanoma. Knowing the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection alone is important to decide whether additional tests, such as a biopsy (removing a part of the lesion for examination under a microscope) are needed to improve accuracy to an acceptable level. 
What did the review study? 
Researchers wanted to find out the diagnostic accuracy of in‐person compared with image‐based visual inspection of suspicious skin lesions. Researchers also wanted to find out whether diagnostic accuracy was improved if doctors used a 'visual inspection checklist' or depending on how experienced in visual inspection they were (level of clinical expertise). They considered the diagnostic accuracy of the first visual inspection of a lesion, for example, by a general practitioner (GP), and of lesions that had been referred for further evaluation, for example, by a dermatologist (doctor specialising in skin problems). 
What are the main results of the review? 
Only 19 studies (17 in‐person studies and 2 image‐based studies) were clear whether the test was the first visual inspection of a lesion or was a visual inspection following referral (for example, when patients are referred by a GP to skin specialists for visual inspection). 
First in‐person visual inspection (3 studies) 
The results of three studies of 1339 suspicious skin lesions suggest that in a group of 1000 lesions, of which 90 (9%) actually are melanoma: 
‐ An estimated 268 will have a visual inspection result indicating melanoma is present. Of these, 185 will not be melanoma and will result in an unnecessary biopsy (false‐positive results). 
‐ An estimated 732 will have a visual inspection result indicating that melanoma is not present. Of these, seven will actually have melanoma and would not be sent for biopsy (false‐negative results). 
Two further studies restricted to 4228 suspicious skin lesions that were all selected to be excised found similar results. 
In‐person visual inspection after referral, all lesions selected to be excised (8 studies) 
The results of eight studies of 5331 suspicious skin lesions suggest that in a group of 1000 lesions, of which 90 (9%) actually are melanoma: 
‐ An estimated 108 will have a visual inspection result indicating melanoma is present, and of these, 39 will not be melanoma and will result in an unnecessary biopsy (false‐positive results). 
‐ Of the 892 lesions with a visual inspection result indicating that melanoma is not present, 21 will actually be melanoma and would not be sent for biopsy (false‐negative results). 
Overall, the number of false‐positive results (diagnosing a skin lesion as a melanoma when it is not) was observed to be higher and the number of false‐negative results (not recognising a melanoma when it is present) lower for first visual inspections of suspicious skin lesions compared to visual inspection following referral. 
Visual inspection of images of suspicious skin lesions (2 studies) 
Accuracy was much lower for visual inspection of images of lesions compared to visual inspection in person. 
Value of visual inspection checklists 
There was no evidence that use of a visual inspection checklist or the level of clinical expertise changed diagnostic accuracy. 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
The majority of included studies diagnosed melanoma by lesion biopsy and confirmed that melanoma was not present by biopsy or by follow‐up over time to make sure the skin lesion remained negative for melanoma. In these studies, biopsy, clinical follow‐up, or specialist clinician diagnosis were the reference standards (means of establishing final diagnoses). Biopsy or follow‐up are likely to have been reliable methods for deciding whether patients really had melanoma. In a few studies, experts diagnosed the absence of melanoma (expert diagnosis), which is less likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether patients really had melanoma. There was lots of variation in the results of the studies in this review and the studies did not always describe fully the methods they used, which made it difficult to assess their reliability. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Thirteen studies were undertaken in Europe (68%), with the remainder undertaken in Asia (n = 1), Oceania (n = 4), and North America (n = 1). Mean age ranged from 30 to 73.6 years (reported in 10 studies). The percentage of individuals with melanoma ranged between 4% and 20% in first visualised lesions and between 1% and 50% in studies of referred lesions. In the majority of studies, the lesions were unlikely to be representative of the range of those seen in practice, for example, only including skin lesions of a certain size or with a specific appearance. In addition, variation in the expertise of clinicians performing visual inspection and in the definition used to decide whether or not melanoma was present across studies makes it unclear as to how visual inspection should be carried out and by whom in order to achieve the accuracy observed in studies. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Error rates from visual inspection are too high for it to be relied upon alone. Although not evaluated in this review, other technologies need to be used to ensure accurate diagnosis of skin cancer. There is considerable variation and uncertainty about the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection alone for the diagnosis of melanoma. There is no evidence to suggest that visual inspection checklists reliably improve the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection, so recommendations cannot be made about when they should be used. Despite the existence of numerous research studies, further, well‐reported studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection with and without visual inspection checklists and by clinicians with different levels of expertise are needed. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.

Functional constipation is defined as chronic constipation with no identifiable underlying cause. It is a significant cause of morbidity in children, accounting for up to 25% of visits to paediatric gastroenterologists. Probiotic preparations may sufficiently alter the gut microbiome and promote normal gut physiology in a way that helps relieve functional constipation. Several studies have sought to address this hypothesis, as well as the role of probiotics in other functional gut disorders. Therefore, it is important to have a focused review to assess the evidence to date. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of probiotics for the management of chronic constipation without a physical explanation in children. 
Search methods
On 28 June 2021, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, WHO ICTR, and ClinicalTrials.gov, with no language, date, publication status, or document type limitations. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed probiotic preparations (including synbiotics) compared to placebo, no treatment or any other interventional preparation in people aged between 0 and 18 years old with a diagnosis of functional constipation according to consensus criteria (such as Rome IV). 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 14 studies (1127 randomised participants): 12 studies assessed probiotics in the treatment of functional constipation, whilst two studies investigated synbiotic preparations. 
Three studies compared probiotics to placebo in relation to the frequency of defecation at study end, but we did not pool them as there was very significant unexplained heterogeneity. Four studies compared probiotics to placebo in relation to treatment success. There may be no difference in global improvement/treatment success (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.26; 313 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Five studies compared probiotics to placebo in relation to withdrawals due to adverse events, with the pooled effect suggesting there may be no difference (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.95; 357 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
The pooled estimate from three studies that compared probiotics plus an osmotic laxative to osmotic laxative alone found there may be no difference in frequency of defecation (MD ‐0.01, 95% CI ‐0.57 to 0.56; 268 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Two studies compared probiotics plus an osmotic laxative to osmotic laxative alone in relation to global improvement/treatment success, and found there may be no difference between the treatments (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.15; 139 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Three studies compared probiotics plus osmotic laxative to osmotic laxative alone in relation to withdrawals due to adverse events, but it is unclear if there is a difference between them (RR 2.86, 95% CI 0.12 to 68.35; 268 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Two studies compared probiotics versus magnesium oxide. It is unclear if there is a difference in frequency of defecation (MD 0.28, 95% CI ‐0.58 to 1.14; 36 participants), treatment success (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.57; 36 participants) or withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.04; 77 participants). The certainty of the evidence is very low for these outcomes. 
One study assessed the role of a synbiotic preparation in comparison to placebo. There may be higher treatment success in favour of synbiotics compared to placebo (RR 2.32, 95% CI 1.54 to 3.47; 155 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The study reported that there were no withdrawals due to adverse effects in either group. 
One study assessed a synbiotic plus paraffin compared to paraffin alone. It is uncertain if there is a difference in frequency of defecation (MD 0.74, 95% CI ‐0.96, 2.44; 66 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), or treatment success (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.17; 66 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The study reported that there were no withdrawals due to adverse effects in either group. 
One study compared a synbiotic preparation to paraffin. It is uncertain if there is a difference in frequency of defecation (MD ‐1.53, 95% CI ‐3.00, ‐0.06; 60 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) or in treatment success (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.65, 1.13; 60 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The study reported that there were no withdrawals due to adverse effects in either group. 
All secondary outcomes were either not reported or reported in a way that did not allow for analysis. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to conclude whether probiotics are efficacious in successfully treating chronic constipation without a physical explanation in children or changing the frequency of defecation, or whether there is a difference in withdrawals due to adverse events when compared with placebo. There is limited evidence from one study to suggest a synbiotic preparation may be more likely than placebo to lead to treatment success, with no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events. 
There is insufficient evidence to draw efficacy or safety conclusions about the use of probiotics in combination with or in comparison to any of the other interventions reported. The majority of the studies that presented data on serious adverse events reported that no events occurred. Two studies did not report this outcome. 
Future studies are needed to confirm efficacy, but the research community requires guidance on the best context for probiotics in such studies, considering where they should be best considered in a potential treatment hierarchy and should align with core outcome sets to support future interpretation of findings.

Do Good Bacteria Help Children with Long-Term Constipation?

### **Rationale**

**What is the health problem?**

Some children have trouble pooping for a long time. This is called constipation. When doctors cannot find a clear reason or sickness causing it, they call it “functional constipation.” This is a common problem. It can make children feel uncomfortable and unwell. It is a main reason why parents take their children to see a stomach doctor.

**Why did we do this study?**

Our bellies have many tiny living things, like bacteria, that help us stay healthy. The good ones are called probiotics. Some people think these good bacteria can help the gut work better. The idea is that giving children probiotics might help ease their constipation.

Many studies have already looked at this idea. But their results were not all the same. So, our team wanted to review all these past studies together. By looking at them all at once, we hoped to get a clearer answer. We wanted to know if probiotics are a safe and helpful treatment for constipation in children.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review, not a new medical trial. This means we did not work with new patients. Instead, our research team searched for and gathered all the best studies that had already been done on this topic. We looked at 14 different studies in total.

**Who was in the studies we looked at?**

The 14 studies included over 1,100 children. The children were from birth up to 18 years old. All of them had long-term constipation that was not caused by another sickness.

In these studies, children were put into different groups by chance. For example, one group of children would get a probiotic. Another group would get a placebo. A placebo is a fake treatment, like a sugar pill, that has no medicine in it. Some studies also compared probiotics to other common medicines for constipation.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

After looking at all the information from the 14 studies, we could not find strong proof that probiotics help children with constipation.

*   **Probiotics compared to a fake treatment (placebo):** The review showed no clear difference between probiotics and a placebo. Children who took probiotics did not seem to poop more often. They also did not have better overall success with their constipation compared to children who took a placebo.
*   **Probiotics added to other poop medicines:** Some children were already taking a medicine called a laxative to help them poop. Studies looked at whether adding a probiotic helped these children. The results showed that taking a probiotic with a laxative did not seem to work any better than taking the laxative by itself.
*   **What about synbiotics?** Some studies looked at something called a synbiotic. This is a mix of good bacteria (a probiotic) plus a special food to help the good bacteria grow. One study found that a synbiotic mix might work better than a placebo. However, this was just one study, so we need more research to be sure.
*   **Were the treatments safe?** We also looked at safety and side effects. Most of the studies said that no serious side effects happened. The number of children who had to stop a study because of a health problem was low and about the same in all the groups.

**What do these results mean?**

Overall, there is not enough good proof to say that probiotics are a helpful treatment for long-term constipation in children. The evidence we have today is not strong or clear enough to recommend them.

We need more and better studies in the future. These studies can help us learn if probiotics or synbiotics can help children who have trouble pooping. For now, parents should talk to their child's doctor about the best and most proven ways to treat constipation.","Probiotics for treatment of chronic constipation in children
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether probiotics can be used to treat chronic constipation without a physical explanation in children (aged 0 to 18 years). 
We analysed data from 14 studies to answer this question.
Key messages 
We were unable to draw conclusions when comparing probiotics to placebo for frequency of defecation in children treated for chronic constipation without a physical explanation. There may be no difference in treatment success between the two groups. 
There may not be a difference in frequency of defecation or treatment success when comparing probiotics and laxatives to using laxatives alone. 
We were unable to draw conclusions when comparing probiotics to magnesium oxide for frequency of defecation or treatment success. 
There may be a higher frequency of defecation in children treated with synbiotic preparations compared to placebo. 
There may not be a difference in participants withdrawing from the studies due to adverse events when comparing probiotic preparations to placebo. 
We were unable to draw conclusions on the safety of any of the other comparisons due to the low number of people who withdrew from the studies. 
What was studied in the review? 
Children often suffer from constipation for long periods of time, and when there is no underlying physical cause that can be found we call it 'functional constipation'. 
It has been suggested that probiotic and synbiotic preparations might help improve symptoms in these children. Probiotics are preparations that contain living bacteria that have been proposed to be beneficial to the digestive system. Synbiotics also include food substances that support the growth of these bacteria. 
There is currently no consensus about whether this is the case, or how these preparations are best used. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) comparing any probiotic or synbiotic treatment with any other treatment (such as dummy/placebo treatments) in children with chronic constipation without a physical explanation. We found 14 trials including a total of 1127 participants who were aged under 18. We made the following conclusions.• There may be no difference in treatment success when comparing probiotics to placebo.• We were unable to draw conclusions on whether there is a difference in the frequency of defecation.• There may be no difference in treatment success when comparing probiotics and laxatives to laxatives alone.• We were unable to draw conclusions on frequency of defecation or treatment success when comparing probiotics to magnesium oxide.• Synbiotics may be better than placebo in improving the frequency of defection.• There may be no difference in how many people withdrew from the trials because of side effects when comparing probiotics to placebo, or probiotics and laxative to laxative alone.• We have limited confidence in the evidence because the studies only included a small number of children, and due to lack of detail on some of the methods used. 
All analyses were limited due to differences in the specific probiotics or the treatments they were compared with, low numbers of children included in the studies and, most importantly, the use of a range of different measures of success. This meant that combining studies was difficult, so the overall ability of this review to answer its core questions was limited. 
What next? 
Future studies are needed to find out how helpful probiotics are for childhood constipation. Researchers need to agree whether probiotics should be a first option therapy, an add‐on to other therapies, a second option after other therapies have failed, or a combination of all the above. 
Future research should measure the same items (known as a core outcome set) to ensure these results can support future reviews. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
This review is current to June 2021.

The use of short‐acting insulin analogues (insulin lispro, insulin aspart, insulin glulisine) for adult, non‐pregnant people with type 2 diabetes is still controversial, as reflected in many scientific debates. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of short‐acting insulin analogues compared to regular human insulin in adult, non‐pregnant people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
Search methods
For this update we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the WHO ICTRP Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov to 31 October 2018. We placed no restrictions on the language of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials with an intervention duration of at least 24 weeks that compared short‐acting insulin analogues to regular human insulin in the treatment of people with type 2 diabetes, who were not pregnant. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We assessed dichotomous outcomes by risk ratios (RR), and Peto odds ratios (POR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed continuous outcomes by mean differences (MD) with 95% CI. We assessed trials for certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We identified 10 trials that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, randomising 2751 participants; 1388 participants were randomised to receive insulin analogues and 1363 participants to receive regular human insulin. The duration of the intervention ranged from 24 to 104 weeks, with a mean of about 41 weeks. The trial populations showed diversity in disease duration, and inclusion and exclusion criteria. None of the trials were blinded, so the risk of performance bias and detection bias, especially for subjective outcomes, such as hypoglycaemia, was high in nine of 10 trials from which we extracted data. Several trials showed inconsistencies in the reporting of methods and results. 
None of the included trials defined all‐cause mortality as a primary outcome. Six trials provided Information on the number of participants who died during the trial, with five deaths out of 1272 participants (0.4%) in the insulin analogue groups and three deaths out of 1247 participants (0.2%) in the regular human insulin groups (Peto OR 1.66, 95% CI 0.41 to 6.64; P = 0.48; moderate‐certainty evidence). Six trials, with 2509 participants, assessed severe hypoglycaemia differently, therefore, we could not summarise the results with a meta‐analysis. Overall, the incidence of severe hypoglycaemic events was low, and none of the trials showed a clear difference between the two intervention arms (low‐certainty evidence). 
The MD in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) change was ‐0.03% (95% CI ‐0.16 to 0.09; P = 0.60; 9 trials, 2608 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The 95% prediction ranged between ‐0.31% and 0.25%. The MD in the overall number of non‐severe hypoglycaemic episodes per participant per month was 0.08 events (95% CI 0.00 to 0.16; P = 0.05; 7 trials, 2667 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The 95% prediction interval ranged between ‐0.03 and 0.19 events per participant per month. The results provided for nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes were of questionable validity. Overall, there was no clear difference between the two short‐acting insulin analogues and regular human insulin. Two trials assessed health‐related quality of life and treatment satisfaction, but we considered the results for both outcomes to be unreliable (very low‐certainty evidence). 
No trial was designed to investigate possible long term effects (all‐cause mortality, microvascular or macrovascular complications of diabetes), especially in participants with diabetes‐related complications. No trial reported on socioeconomic effects. 
Authors' conclusions
Our analysis found no clear benefits of short‐acting insulin analogues over regular human insulin in people with type 2 diabetes. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was poor and results on patient‐relevant outcomes, like all‐cause mortality, microvascular or macrovascular complications and severe hypoglycaemic episodes were sparse. Long‐term efficacy and safety data are needed to draw conclusions about the effects of short‐acting insulin analogues on patient‐relevant outcomes.

### **Plain Title**

Are Newer Fast-Acting Insulins Better Than Older Insulins for People with Type 2 Diabetes?

### **Rationale**

Many people live with a health condition called type 2 diabetes. This means their body has trouble using sugar from food for energy. This can lead to high sugar levels in the blood. High blood sugar over time can cause serious health problems.

To control their blood sugar, some people with type 2 diabetes need to take a medicine called insulin. Insulin helps the body use sugar in the right way. There are different types of insulin. Some work very fast.

For a long time, people have used a fast-acting insulin called regular human insulin. In recent years, newer fast-acting insulins have been made. These are called insulin analogues. Doctors and scientists are not sure if these newer insulins are better or safer than the older, regular insulin for people with type 2 diabetes.

This study was done to find out. Researchers wanted to compare the newer insulins with the older, regular insulin. They looked at the effects on blood sugar control and safety. This work helps patients and doctors make better choices about treatment.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked for all the good studies that had already been done on this topic. They combined the results to get a stronger answer.

They found 10 different studies to review. These studies included over 2,700 adults with type 2 diabetes. Women who were pregnant did not take part.

In each of the 10 studies, people were put into two groups by chance.
*   One group took one of the newer, fast-acting insulins.
*   The other group took the older, regular human insulin.

By comparing the groups, researchers could see if one insulin worked better than the other. The people in these studies were followed for about 6 months to 2 years.

### **Results**

The main finding was that there were no clear benefits of using the newer, fast-acting insulins compared to the older, regular insulin.

Here is what the researchers found:

*   **Blood Sugar Control:** Researchers looked at a blood test called HbA1c. This test shows a person's average blood sugar over the past 2 to 3 months. Both the newer insulins and the older insulin lowered blood sugar levels by about the same amount. There was no real difference between them.

*   **Low Blood Sugar:** Sometimes, insulin can make blood sugar go too low. This is called hypoglycemia. Very low blood sugar can be dangerous. In the studies, serious low blood sugar was rare in both groups. There was no clear difference between the two types of insulin.

*   **Deaths:** Very few people died during the studies. The number of deaths was about the same in both the newer insulin groups and the older insulin group.

*   **Long-Term Health Problems:** The studies did not last long enough to see if the insulins protected people from long-term problems of diabetes. These can include damage to the eyes, kidneys, or heart.

*   **How People Felt:** The studies did not give reliable information about how people felt. We do not know if one insulin made people feel better than the other.

The researchers who did this review concluded that the proof was not very strong. Based on the studies they looked at, there is no clear evidence that newer, fast-acting insulins work better than older, regular insulin for adults with type 2 diabetes. They believe we need more studies that last for a longer time. These studies should focus on long-term health and safety to give patients and doctors a clearer answer.","Short‐acting insulin analogues versus regular human insulin for type 2 diabetes mellitus
Review question 
Are short‐acting insulin analogues better than regular human insulin for adult, non‐pregnant people with type 2 diabetes? 
Background 
Short‐acting insulin analogues act more quickly than regular human insulin. They can be injected immediately before meals and lead to lower blood sugar levels after food intake. Whether people with diabetes really profit from these newer insulins is debated. 
Study characteristics 
We found 10 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing the short‐acting insulin analogues insulin lispro, insulin aspart, or insulin glulisine to regular human insulin in 2751 participants. The people in the included trials were monitored (followed) for 24 to 104 weeks. 
This evidence is up to date as of 31 October 2018.
Key results 
We are uncertain whether short‐acting insulin analogues are better than regular human insulin for long‐term blood glucose control or for reducing the number of times blood sugar levels drop below normal (hypoglycaemic episodes). The studies were too short to reliably investigate death from any cause. We found no clear effect of insulin analogues on health‐related quality of life. We found no information on late diabetes complications, such as problems with the eyes, kidneys, or feet. No study reported on socioeconomic effects, such as costs of the intervention and absence from work. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The overall certainty of the included studies was low or very low for most outcomes, mainly because all studies were carried out in an open‐labelled fashion (study participants and study personnel knew who was getting which treatment). Several studies also showed inconsistencies in the reporting of methods, and results were imprecise.

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, Scopus SciVerse, ISRCTN registry, US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We also searched reference lists of included trials to identify other eligible trials which our search strategy may have missed. The date of the search was 20 July 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving participants with a confirmed LMH diagnosis which reported one or more surgical intervention(s), alone or in combination, in at least one arm of the RCT. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methods as expected by Cochrane. Two study authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias for included trials. Trial authors were contacted for further information and clarification. 
Main results
A single RCT was eligible for inclusion. Thirty‐six participants were randomised in a 2:1 ratio; 24 were allocated to undergo surgery (pars plana vitrectomy, peeling of the epiretial proliferation followed by fovea‐sparing removal of the internal limiting membrane) and 12 (10 following two participant dropouts) to observation. 
Overall, the certainty of the evidence was low for all outcomes due to selection and detection bias, and the low number of participants enrolled in the study which may affect the accuracy of results and reliability of conclusions. 
At six‐month follow‐up, change in vision was better in the surgery group (‐0.27 logMAR improvement) than observation (0.02 worsening) (mean difference (MD): ‐0.29 logMAR, 95% confidence intervals (CI): ‐0.33 to ‐0.25). Central retinal thickness increased in the surgery group over 6 months 126 μm increase) compared with observation group (decrease by 11μm) (MD: 137 μm, 95% CI: 125.87 μm to 148.13 μm). Finally, at six‐month follow‐up, retinal sensitivity was better in the surgery group (3.03 dB increase) compared with the observation group (0.06 dB decrease) (MD: 3.09 dB, 95% CI: 2.07 to 4.11 dB). 
Vision‐related quality of life and metamorphopsia were not reported. No adverse outcomes or complications were reported in the study, however, authors could not provide information on whether any individuals developed deterioration in vision of 0.2 logMAR or worse. 
Authors' conclusions
The included single trial demonstrated improvements in visual and anatomical outcome measures for participants with a LMH who underwent surgery compared with observation only. Therefore, we can conclude that participants who undergo surgery may achieve superior post‐operative best corrected visual acuity and anatomical outcomes compared with observation only. However, the results of a single and small RCT provides limited evidence to support or refute surgery as an effective management option for LMHs. Future RCTs with a larger number of participants and with fewer methodological limitations and biases are necessary to inform future clinical practice.

Surgery for a Small Hole in the Eye: Is It Better Than Watching and Waiting?

### **Rationale**

**What is the health problem?**

The back of your eye has a thin layer called the retina. The retina acts like the film in a camera. It helps you see the world. The center part of the retina is called the macula. The macula is very important for seeing details clearly when you read, drive, or look at faces.

Sometimes, a person can get a small tear in their macula. This is called a lamellar macular hole. It is not a full hole that goes all the way through. It is more like a small dent or partial tear on the surface. This can cause vision to become blurry or wavy. It can make daily tasks difficult. Over time, vision might get even worse.

**Why did we need this study?**

Doctors are not sure about the best way to treat this eye problem. One choice is to do surgery to try and fix the tear. The other choice is to just watch the eye closely to see if it changes. This is called observation.

There is not enough proof to show which choice is better for patients. This study looked for high-quality research to find out if surgery helps people see better and improves the health of their eye compared to just watching and waiting. Researchers wanted to know if the benefits of surgery are worth it.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

The researchers searched for studies that compared surgery to no surgery for people with a lamellar macular hole. They found only one study that was designed well enough to include.

This one study had 36 people with this eye problem. The people were put into two groups by chance. This is like flipping a coin to decide which group a person goes into.

One group had 24 people. These people had surgery to repair the eye. In the surgery, the doctor removed the gel-like fluid from the inside of the eye. Then, the doctor gently peeled away a very thin layer of tissue from the top of the retina to help the tear close.

The other group had 12 people. These people did not have surgery. Their doctors just watched their eyes to see how they did over time. Two people left this group during the study, so 10 people finished. The study followed everyone for 6 months to see what happened to their vision and their eyes.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

After 6 months, the study found that the people who had surgery had better results than the people who had no surgery.

*   **Better Vision:** The people in the surgery group had their vision improve. The people in the watch-and-wait group had their vision get a little bit worse.

*   **Healthier Eyes:** The surgery helped the macula to heal. Scans showed that the retina in the center of the eye became thicker for the people who had surgery. This is a good sign that the eye was getting better. For the people who did not have surgery, the retina got a little thinner.

*   **Better Eye Function:** The retina’s ability to sense light also got better in the surgery group. It did not improve for the watch-and-wait group. The study did not report on side effects from the surgery.

**What do these results mean?**

The results from this one study suggest that surgery may help improve vision for people with this eye problem. However, the researchers said we must be careful. This was a very small study with only a few people. Small studies can sometimes give results that are not fully reliable.

This means we have some early signs that surgery might be helpful. But we cannot be sure yet. We need bigger and better studies in the future to know for certain if surgery is the best choice for people with a lamellar macular hole. This study is an important first step.","The effectiveness of surgery for treating lamellar macular holes
Why is this question important?Lamellar macular holes are small partial‐thickness defects affecting the centre of the retina, called the macula. The retina is the layer at the back of the eye that detects light, and the macula is essential for detailed vision. It has been suggested that surgery can prevent vision loss (or improve vision) in people with lamellar macular holes, but there is no current consensus. We reviewed published research to determine whether surgery improves vision for people with a lamellar macular hole. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?First, we searched for randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), because these studies provide the most robust evidence about the effects of treatment. We then planned to compare the results, and summarise the evidence from the studies. Finally, we then aimed to rate our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and how similar the findings of the different studies were. 
What did we find?We found one study that involved a total of 36 people with a diagnosis of a lamellar macular hole. This study showed that people who underwent surgery may achieve better vision six months after their surgery compared with people who were observed without receiving surgery. However, limitations in the study design and its small size means that our confidence in the evidence was low. 
What does this mean?It remains unclear whether surgery is effective for people with lamellar macular holes. Further research is required. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to 20 July 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD015308,"Background
Interleukin‐1 (IL‐1) blocking agents have been used for treating severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), on the premise that their immunomodulatory effect might be beneficial in people with COVID‐19. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of IL‐1 blocking agents compared with standard care alone or with placebo on effectiveness and safety outcomes in people with COVID‐19. 
We will update this assessment regularly.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and the COVID‐19 L‐OVE Platform (search date 5 November 2021). These sources are maintained through regular searches of MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, trial registers and other sources. We also checked the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, regulatory agency websites, Retraction Watch (search date 3 November 2021). 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating IL‐1 blocking agents compared with standard care alone or with placebo for people with COVID‐19, regardless of disease severity. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed Cochrane methodology. The protocol was amended to reduce the number of outcomes considered. Two researchers independently screened and extracted data and assessed the risk of bias with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the critical outcomes of clinical improvement (Day 28; ≥ D60); WHO Clinical Progression Score of level 7 or above (i.e. the proportion of participants with mechanical ventilation +/‐ additional organ support OR death) (D28; ≥ D60); all‐cause mortality (D28; ≥ D60); incidence of any adverse events; and incidence of serious adverse events. 
Main results
We identified four RCTs of anakinra (three published in peer‐reviewed journals, one reported as a preprint) and two RCTs of canakinumab (published in peer‐reviewed journals). All trials were multicentre (2 to 133 centres). Two trials stopped early (one due to futility and one as the trigger for inferiority was met). The median/mean age range varied from 58 to 68 years; the proportion of men varied from 58% to 77%. All participants were hospitalised; 67% to 100% were on oxygen at baseline but not intubated; between 0% and 33% were intubated at baseline. We identified a further 16 registered trials with no results available, of which 15 assessed anakinra (four completed, four terminated, five ongoing, three not recruiting) and one (completed) trial assessed canakinumab. 
Effectiveness of anakinra for people with COVID‐19  
Anakinra probably results in little or no increase in clinical improvement at D28 (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.20; 3 RCTs, 837 participants; absolute effect: 59 more per 1000 (from 22 fewer to 147 more); moderate‐certainty evidence. 
The evidence is uncertain about an effect of anakinra on 1) the proportion of participants with a WHO Clinical Progression Score of level 7 or above at D28 (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.22; 2 RCTs, 722 participants; absolute effect: 55 fewer per 1000 (from 107 fewer to 37 more); low‐certainty evidence) and ≥ D60 (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.96; 1 RCT, 606 participants; absolute effect: 47 fewer per 1000 (from 72 fewer to 4 fewer) low‐certainty evidence); and 2) all‐cause mortality at D28 (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.39; 2 RCTs, 722 participants; absolute effect: 32 fewer per 1000 (from 68 fewer to 40 more); low‐certainty evidence).  
The evidence is very uncertain about an effect of anakinra on 1) the proportion of participants with clinical improvement at ≥ D60 (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.12; 1 RCT, 115 participants; absolute effect: 59 fewer per 1000 (from 186 fewer to 102 more); very low‐certainty evidence); and 2) all‐cause mortality at ≥ D60 (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.56; 4 RCTs, 1633 participants; absolute effect: 8 more per 1000 (from 84 fewer to 147 more); very low‐certainty evidence). 
Safety of anakinra for people with COVID‐19  
Anakinra probably results in little or no increase in adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.11; 2 RCTs, 722 participants; absolute effect: 14 more per 1000 (from 43 fewer to 78 more); moderate‐certainty evidence).  
The evidence is uncertain regarding an effect of anakinra on serious adverse events (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.56; 2 RCTs, 722 participants; absolute effect: 12 fewer per 1000 (from 104 fewer to 138 more); low‐certainty evidence). 
Effectiveness of canakinumab for people with COVID‐19  
Canakinumab probably results in little or no increase in clinical improvement at D28 (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.14; 2 RCTs, 499 participants; absolute effect: 42 more per 1000 (from 33 fewer to 116 more); moderate‐certainty evidence).  
The evidence of an effect of canakinumab is uncertain on 1) the proportion of participants with a WHO Clinical Progression Score of level 7 or above at D28 (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.20; 2 RCTs, 499 participants; absolute effect: 35 fewer per 1000 (from 69 fewer to 25 more); low‐certainty evidence); and 2) all‐cause mortality at D28 (RR:0.75; 95% CI 0.39 to 1.42); 2 RCTs, 499 participants; absolute effect: 20 fewer per 1000 (from 48 fewer to 33 more); low‐certainty evidence).  
The evidence is very uncertain about an effect of canakinumab on all‐cause mortality at ≥ D60 (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.91; 1 RCT, 45 participants; absolute effect: 112 fewer per 1000 (from 210 fewer to 227 more); very low‐certainty evidence). 
Safety of canakinumab for people with COVID‐19  
Canakinumab probably results in little or no increase in adverse events (RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.21; 1 RCT, 454 participants; absolute effect: 11 more per 1000 (from 74 fewer to 111 more); moderate‐certainty evidence). 
The evidence of an effect of canakinumab on serious adverse events is uncertain (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.13; 2 RCTs, 499 participants; absolute effect: 44 fewer per 1000 (from 94 fewer to 28 more); low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Overall, we did not find evidence for an important beneficial effect of IL‐1 blocking agents. The evidence is uncertain or very uncertain for several outcomes. Sixteen trials of anakinra and canakinumab with no results are currently registered, of which four are completed, and four terminated. The findings of this review are updated on the COVID‐NMA platform (covid-nma.com).

### **Plain Title**

Do Drugs that Block a Body Signal Called IL-1 Help People with COVID-19?

### **Rationale**

COVID-19 can make people very sick. In some people, the body’s own defense system, called the immune system, can overreact. This overreaction can cause a lot of swelling and damage inside the body, especially in the lungs.

Scientists believe a body signal called Interleukin-1, or IL-1, may cause this overreaction. There are drugs that can block this IL-1 signal. Researchers thought that by blocking this signal, the drugs could calm down the body’s defense system. This might help people with severe COVID-19 get better.

This review was done to see if these drugs really work for people with COVID-19. Researchers also wanted to check if the drugs were safe.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of other studies that were already finished. They looked for a specific kind of study where people are put into groups by chance. This is the best way to see if a treatment works.

In these studies, one group of people got a drug that blocks IL-1. The other group got the usual treatment for COVID-19 or a fake treatment, also called a placebo.

The review looked at six studies in total. All the people in these studies were adults who were in the hospital with COVID-19. Their average age was between 58 and 68 years old. Most of them were men. Most people were getting extra oxygen to help them breathe when they joined the studies. Researchers checked on how the people were doing for about one to two months.

### **Results**

The review looked at two different drugs that block the IL-1 signal. The drugs were named **anakinra** and **canakinumab**.

**What did the study find for the drug anakinra?**
*   The drug probably made little to no difference in helping people get better after about one month.
*   The evidence was not clear if the drug helped people avoid needing a breathing machine or other life support.
*   The evidence was also not clear if the drug helped prevent people from dying.
*   Anakinra probably did not cause more side effects than the usual care. The evidence was not clear if it caused more very bad side effects.

**What did the study find for the drug canakinumab?**
*   This drug also probably made little to no difference in helping people get better after about one month.
*   The evidence was not clear if the drug helped people avoid needing a breathing machine.
*   It was also not clear if this drug helped prevent people from dying.
*   Canakinumab probably did not cause more side effects. The evidence was not clear if it caused more very bad side effects.

**What do these results mean?**
The researchers who did this review concluded that they did not find good proof that these drugs help people with COVID-19. For many important questions, like whether the drugs prevent death, the proof was not strong enough to be sure. This means we still do not know if these drugs are helpful for COVID-19.

Other studies on these drugs are still going on. The researchers will update this review when they have more information.","Are medicines that block interleukin‐1 (a protein involved in immune responses) effective treatments for COVID‐19 and do they cause unwanted effects? 
Key messages 
• Overall, we did not find sufficient evidence to show that medicines that block interleukin‐1 (a protein involved in immune responses) are effective treatments for people with COVID‐19, or whether they cause unwanted effects. 
• We found 16 studies with unpublished results. We will update this review when new data are available. 
• In future, we need high‐quality studies to evaluate medicines that block interleukin‐1 to treat COVID‐19.  
What is interleukin‐1 and what is its role in COVID‐19? 
Interleukin‐1 (IL‐1) is a type of protein called a cytokine, which helps to regulate the body’s immune system. In particular, IL‐1 triggers inflammation to help fight infection. In COVID‐19, as the immune system fights the virus, the lungs and airways become inflamed, causing breathing difficulties. However, in some people, the immune system can over‐react (called a ‘cytokine storm’) and produce dangerously high levels of inflammation and tissue damage. This can lead to severe breathing difficulties, organ failure and death. 
What are interleukin‐1 ‘blockers’? 
IL‐1 blockers are medicines that stop IL‐1 from working by blocking signals from IL‐1 to other parts of the immune system. This reduces inflammation and may help the immune system to fight COVID‐19. In turn, this may reduce the need for breathing support with a ventilator (a machine that breathes for a patient) and reduce the number of deaths from COVID‐19. Three IL‐1 blockers are available: anakinra, canakinumab and rilonacept. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know if IL‐1 blockers are effective treatments for people with COVID‐19, compared with standard care alone or with placebo (a dummy treatment that appears identical to the medicine being tested but without any active medicine). We were particularly interested in the effects of IL‐1 blockers on: 
•  whether people’s symptoms got better or worse;
•  how many people died; and
•  any unwanted effects and serious unwanted effects.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed the effects of IL‐1 blockers to treat people with COVID‐19 compared with standard care alone or with placebo. People in the studies could have suspected or confirmed COVID‐19 of any severity (mild, moderate or severe), and be any age or sex. 
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found six studies with 2132 people. Four studies assessed anakinra (1633 people) and two assessed canakinumab (499 people). People in the studies were aged between 58 and 68 years old on average, and the majority were men. All the people in the studies were in hospital, mainly with moderate to critical COVID‐19. The studies varied in size, from 45 to 2253 people. At the start of the studies, 67% to 100% of people were receiving oxygen, and 0% to 33% were on a ventilator. 
We also found 16 studies that have not yet published their results.
Anakinra compared to usual care and placebo to treat people with COVID‐19 
• Anakinra probably results in little or no improvement in COVID‐19 symptoms (defined as improvement on a clinical scale or discharge from hospital) at 28 days after treatment (three studies, 837 people) but we do not know if it makes a difference at 60 days (one study, 115 people). 
• We do not know if anakinra makes a difference to the number of deaths at 28 days after treatment (two studies, 722 people) or at 60 days (four studies, 1633 people). 
• Anakinra probably results in little or no increase in any unwanted effects at 28 days after treatment, but we are not sure about its effect on serious unwanted effects (two studies, 722 people).  
Canakinumab compared to usual care and placebo to treat people with COVID‐19 
• Canakinumab probably results in little or no improvement in COVID‐19 symptoms (defined as improvement on a clinical scale or discharge from hospital) at 28 days after treatment (two studies, 499 people).  
• We do not know if canakinumab makes a difference to the number of deaths at 28 days after treatment (two studies, 499 people) or at 60 days (one study, 45 people).  
• Canakinumab probably results in little or no increase in any unwanted effects (one study, 454 people), but we are not sure about its effect on serious unwanted effects (two studies, 499 people) at 28 days.  
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the evidence is limited for several reasons. All the people in the studies were hospitalised, but some were more seriously ill than others ‐ some studies only included people on a ventilator. Usual care also differed between studies, and studies measured and reported their results using different methods.  
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to 5 November 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013210.pub2,"Background
Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic disease of the gut. About 75% of people with CD undergo surgery at least once in their lifetime to induce remission. However, as there is no known cure for the disease, patients usually experience a recurrence even after surgery. Different interventions are routinely used in maintaining postsurgical remission. There is currently no consensus on which treatment is the most effective. 
Objectives
To assess the effects and harms of interventions for the maintenance of surgically induced remission in Crohn's disease and rank the treatments in order of effectiveness. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to 15 January 2019. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles, abstracts from major gastroenterology meetings, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP. There was no restriction on language, date, or publication status. 
Selection criteria
We considered for inclusion randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different interventions used for maintaining surgically induced remission in people with CD who were in postsurgical remission. Participants had to have received maintenance treatment for at least three months. We excluded studies assessing enteral diet, diet manipulation, herbal medicine, and nutritional supplementation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected relevant studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or by arbitration of a third review author when necessary. We conducted a network meta‐analysis (NMA) using a Bayesian approach through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. For the pairwise comparisons carried out in Review Manager 5, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For the NMA, we presented hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding 95% credible intervals (95% CrI) and reported ranking probabilities for each intervention. For the NMA, we focused on three main outcomes: clinical relapse, endoscopic relapse, and withdrawals due to adverse events. Data were insufficient to assess time to relapse and histologic relapse. Adverse events and serious adverse events were not sufficiently or objectively reported to permit an NMA. We used CINeMA (Confidence in Network Meta‐Analysis) methods to evaluate our confidence in the findings within networks, and GRADE for entire networks. 
Main results
We included 35 RCTs (3249 participants) in the review. The average age of study participants ranged between 33.6 and 38.8 years. Risk of bias was high in 18 studies, low in four studies, and unclear in 13 studies. Of the 35 included RCTs, 26 studies (2581 participants; 9 interventions) were considered eligible for inclusion in the NMA. The interventions studied included 5‐aminosalicylic acid (5‐ASA), adalimumab, antibiotics, budesonide, infliximab, probiotics, purine analogues, sulfasalazine, and a combination of sulfasalazine and prednisolone. This resulted in 30 direct contrasts, which informed 102 mixed‐treatment contrasts. 
The evidence for the clinical relapse network (21 studies; 2245 participants) and endoscopic relapse (12 studies; 1128 participants) were of low certainty while the evidence for withdrawal due to adverse events (15 studies; 1498 participants) was of very low certainty. This assessment was due to high risk of bias in most of the studies, inconsistency, and imprecision across networks. We mainly judged individual contrasts as of low or very low certainty, except 5‐ASA versus placebo, the evidence for which was judged as of moderate certainty. 
We ranked the treatments based on effectiveness and the certainty of the evidence. For clinical relapse, the five most highly ranked treatments were adalimumab, infliximab, budesonide, 5‐ASA, and purine analogues. We found some evidence that adalimumab (HR 0.11, 95% Crl 0.02 to 0.33; low‐certainty evidence) and 5‐ASA may reduce the probability of clinical relapse compared to placebo (HR 0.69, 95% Crl 0.53 to 0.87; moderate‐certainty evidence). However, budesonide may not be effective in preventing clinical relapse (HR 0.66, 95% CrI 0.27 to 1.34; low‐certainty evidence). We are less confident about the effectiveness of infliximab (HR 0.36, 95% CrI 0.02 to 1.74; very low‐certainty evidence) and purine analogues (HR 0.75, 95% CrI 0.55 to 1.00; low‐certainty evidence). It was unclear whether the other interventions reduced the probability of a clinical relapse, as the certainty of the evidence was very low. 
Due to high risk of bias and limited data across the network, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of interventions for preventing endoscopic relapse. Whilst there might be some evidence of prevention of endoscopic relapse with adalimumab (HR 0.10, 95% CrI 0.01 to 0.32; low‐certainty evidence), no other intervention studied appeared to be effective. 
Due to high risk of bias and limited data across the network, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of interventions for preventing withdrawal due to adverse events. Withdrawal due to adverse events appeared to be least likely with sulfasalazine (HR 1.96, 95% Crl 0.00 to 8.90; very low‐certainty evidence) and most likely with antibiotics (HR 53.92, 95% Crl 0.43 to 259.80; very low‐certainty evidence). When considering the network as a whole, two adverse events leading to study withdrawal (i.e. pancreatitis and leukopenia) occurred in more than 1% of participants treated with an intervention. Pancreatitis occurred in 2.8% (11/399) of purine analogue participants compared to 0.17% (2/1210) of all other groups studied. Leukopenia occurred in 2.5% (10/399) of purine analogue participants compared to 0.08% (1/1210) of all other groups studied. 
Authors' conclusions
Due to low‐certainty evidence in the networks, we are unable to draw conclusions on which treatment is most effective for preventing clinical relapse and endoscopic relapse. Evidence on the safety of the interventions was inconclusive, however cases of pancreatitis and leukopenia from purine analogues were evident in the studies. Larger trials are needed to further understand the effect of the interventions on endoscopic relapse.

Which Treatment is Best to Stop Crohn’s Disease from Coming Back After Surgery?

**Rationale**
Crohn's disease is a long-term illness. It affects the gut, which includes the stomach and bowels. The disease can cause pain, diarrhea, and make people feel very tired. It can be a heavy burden for people who live with it. There is no cure for Crohn’s disease.

Many people with Crohn's disease need surgery. Surgery can remove a damaged part of the gut. This helps people feel better for a while. But even after surgery, the disease often comes back.

Doctors use many different medicines to try to stop Crohn's disease from returning after surgery. But we do not know for sure which medicine works best. The goal of this research was to look at all the past studies on this topic. Researchers wanted to compare the different treatments to find out which ones are safest and work the best.

**Trial Design**
This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers looked for all the past studies that had already been done. They found 35 studies to review. They combined the results from these studies to compare all the different treatments at once.

The studies included over 3,000 people in total. All of these people had Crohn's disease and had surgery to help them go into remission. Remission is a time when the disease is not active. The average age of the people in the studies was in their mid to late 30s.

The researchers looked at nine different types of medicines. Some of these were adalimumab, infliximab, and budesonide. They were often compared to a placebo. A placebo is a pill or treatment that has no medicine in it, like a sugar pill. People in the studies took their treatment for at least three months.

**Results**
The researchers found that it is hard to be sure which treatment is best. This is because many of the past studies they looked at were not done very well. This means the proof for most treatments is weak. The researchers said they were not very confident in the results.

Some medicines seemed to help stop symptoms from coming back. A medicine called adalimumab might work well to keep the disease from returning. Another medicine called 5-ASA might also help. The researchers were less sure if other medicines, like infliximab, worked.

The researchers also looked at whether the medicines stopped the disease that a doctor can see with a camera inside the gut. Again, the proof was weak. Adalimumab might have helped with this, but the researchers could not be sure about any of the other medicines.

The study also looked at side effects. It was hard to compare side effects for most medicines. But they did find that one type of medicine, called purine analogues, caused problems for a small number of people. These problems included a swollen pancreas, which helps you digest food, and low levels of white blood cells, which help fight infection.

In the end, the researchers could not say for sure which treatment is the best to use after surgery. The proof from past studies is not strong enough to make a clear choice. They believe that we need new, bigger, and better studies in the future. This will help doctors and patients make better choices about how to keep Crohn’s disease from coming back.","Interventions for maintaining surgically included remission in Crohn's disease
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out which drugs are most effective for maintaining remission in people with Crohn's disease who have undergone surgery to achieve remission. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. We examined these studies using a method known as network meta‐analysis (NMA) in order to compare and rank all the treatments in terms of clinical relapse, endoscopic relapse and safety. 
What was studied in the review? 
Crohn's disease is a chronic disease of the gut. It is known to change from periods when people experience a flare‐up of the disease (relapse) to periods of good health (remission). Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhoea and weight loss. People with Crohn's disease may undergo surgery to remove diseased parts of their gut and achieve remission. However, their symptoms return after a while. Different drugs can be given to ensure that people with Crohn's disease remain in remission for as long as possible. These drugs include mesalazine, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and adalimumab, amongst others. Whilst these drugs have been known to reduce inflammation (pain and swelling) in the gut, side effects can occur with their use. We attempted to find out which treatments are the safest and most effective for maintaining remission in people with Crohn's disease after surgery. 
How up‐to‐date is the review? 
We searched for studies published up to 15 January 2019.
What are the main results of the review? 
We included 35 relevant trials, which were published between 1976 and 2018. The studies included a total of 3249 participants who were mostly adults. Our NMA included 26 studies (2581 participants) and compared nine groups of treatments such as 5‐aminosalicylic acid, adalimumab, antibiotics, budesonide, infliximab, probiotics, purine analogues, sulfasalazine, and a combination of sulfasalazine and prednisolone, which are used in preventing relapse after surgery in people with Crohn's disease. Adalimumab may reduce the chance of clinical relapse compared with placebo (dummy treatment). 5‐aminosalicylic acid probably reduces the chance of clinical relapse compared with placebo. Budesonide may not be effective in preventing clinical relapse. The entire network evidence is of low certainty due to the small number of participants included in the studies and high risk of bias. This means that are confidence in these results is limited. Research to understand the effect of the treatments on endoscopic relapse and safety was limited, however cases of pancreatitis and leukopenia were reported in participants who received purine analogues. 
Key messages 
We uncertain about which treatments are most effective in preventing postoperative relapse in Crohn's disease. Alhough there is limited research on the harms (side effects) of these treatments, there were reported instances of pancreatitis and leukopenia in participants who received purine analogues.

Background 
Psoriasis is a long‐term inflammatory skin condition that can markedly reduce the quality of life of affected individuals. Treatments taken by mouth (oral treatments), such as methotrexate, ciclosporin, and acitretin, are commonly prescribed to people with moderate to severe psoriasis. Oral fumaric acid esters (FAE) are licensed for the treatment of psoriasis in Germany but remain unlicensed in most other countries. This means that there are different treatment options offered to people in different countries. 
Review question 
What is the available evidence for the benefits and risks of using FAE for treating psoriasis? 
Study characteristics 
Our review included six randomised control trials (RCTs) that involved 544 participants. Five RCTs compared FAE with placebo, and one compared FAE with methotrexate. The outcomes we were interested in measuring were the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), which is a psoriasis severity score, and the proportion of participants who discontinued treatment because of adverse (side) effects that are common but sufficiently serious that the drug had to be stopped, such as severe diarrhoea, infections, or cutaneous malignancy. 
Key results 
It was difficult to pool and compare results because outcome measures differed between the studies. Three studies reported significant benefit with FAE when compared with placebo after 12 to 16 weeks of treatment, but we could not combine these results in a statistical analysis to show the overall difference. The included studies did not fully examine the chance of discontinuing FAE treatment because of adverse effects, which is uncertain. One study showed that individuals on FAE are nearly five times more likely to develop nuisance adverse effects; the most common were diarrhoea and abdominal cramps, flushing, reversible protein loss in the urine, and raised levels of eosinophil blood cells. Two RCTs were similar enough to allow the combination of their results and found that FAE were better than placebo when measured by the proportion of individuals who experienced at least a 50% improvement in their psoriasis severity score. One study reported improvement of individuals' quality of life with FAE in comparison with placebo, but the significance of this difference could not be calculated. The benefit of FAE was similar to methotrexate after 12 weeks when changes in disease severity from the start to the end of the trial were compared. The number of individuals experiencing nuisance adverse effects with these two treatments was not significantly different. The included studies, which were too small and of limited duration to provide evidence about rare or delayed effects, reported no serious adverse effects of FAE. 
Quality of the evidence 
The risk of study bias, which means any factors that may systematically deviate away from the true findings, was unclear in most studies. This may be because most of the studies were conducted decades ago or were incompletely reported. Several analyses comparing FAE with placebo and methotrexate were limited because the studies were small or did not provide enough information to establish how these treatments compare with each other. Therefore, the overall quality of the evidence was low when comparing FAE with placebo and very low when comparing FAE with methotrexate. 
Future RCTs should use standard psoriasis outcome measures, including a validated quality of life scale, to enable the comparison and combination of results. They should be longer in duration or have longer follow‐up phases to provide evidence about any delayed adverse effects. 
","Here is the Plain Language Summary of the study.

### **A Study of the Pill FAE for Psoriasis**

#### **Rationale**

Psoriasis is a long-term skin condition. It can cause red and scaly patches on the skin. These patches can be itchy and sore. Living with psoriasis can be hard and can affect a person's daily life.

There are many treatments for psoriasis. Some are pills you take by mouth. One of these pills is called Fumaric Acid Ester, or FAE for short. Doctors in Germany use this pill to treat psoriasis. But doctors in most other countries do not.

This means people may get different treatments depending on where they live. Researchers wanted to find out more about FAE. They asked: Is FAE a good and safe treatment for psoriasis? They looked at past studies to find an answer. This work helps doctors and patients make better choices about treatment.

#### **Trial Design**

This was a review of past studies. Researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they gathered information from 6 studies that were already finished. In total, these studies included 544 people with psoriasis. Each study lasted for about 3 to 4 months.

In most of the studies, one group of people took FAE pills. Another group took a placebo. A placebo is a pretend pill with no medicine inside, like a sugar pill. It helps researchers see if the real medicine works better than nothing.

One of the studies was different. It compared people taking FAE to people taking another common psoriasis pill. This other pill is called methotrexate. This helps to see if FAE works as well as other common treatments.

#### **Results**

The researchers found that the proof for FAE was not very strong. Many of the old studies they looked at were small. Some were also done a long time ago or were not reported well. This makes it hard to be completely sure about the results.

Some good effects were seen. In a few studies, FAE worked better than the pretend pill. More people who took FAE saw their skin get much better. Their skin improved by at least half. FAE also seemed to work about as well as the other medicine, methotrexate.

People who took FAE were more likely to have side effects than people who took the pretend pill. The most common problems were stomach cramps, diarrhea, and flushing. Flushing is when your skin gets red and feels warm for a short time. These side effects were not dangerous, but they did bother some people.

The researchers concluded that FAE might be a helpful medicine for psoriasis. But we need better studies to know for sure. Future studies should be larger and last longer. This will give us a clearer picture of the benefits and risks of using FAE.","Oral fumaric acid esters for the treatment of psoriasis

10.1002-14651858.CD013165.pub2,"Background
Hyperkalaemia is a common electrolyte abnormality caused by reduced renal potassium excretion in patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD). Potassium binders, such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate and calcium polystyrene sulfonate, are widely used but may lead to constipation and other adverse gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, reducing their tolerability. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are newer ion exchange resins for treatment of hyperkalaemia which may cause fewer GI side‐effects. Although more recent studies are focusing on clinically‐relevant endpoints such as cardiac complications or death, the evidence on safety is still limited. Given the recent expansion in the available treatment options, it is appropriate to review the evidence of effectiveness and tolerability of all potassium exchange resins among people with CKD, with the aim to provide guidance to consumers, practitioners, and policy‐makers. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of potassium binders for treating chronic hyperkalaemia among adults and children with CKD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 10 March 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised controlled studies (quasi‐RCTs) evaluating potassium binders for chronic hyperkalaemia administered in adults and children with CKD. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed risks of bias and extracted data. Treatment estimates were summarised by random effects meta‐analysis and expressed as relative risk (RR) or mean difference (MD), with 95% confidence interval (CI). Evidence certainty was assessed using GRADE processes. 
Main results
Fifteen studies, randomising 1849 adult participants were eligible for inclusion. Twelve studies involved participants with CKD (stages 1 to 5) not requiring dialysis and three studies were among participants treated with haemodialysis. Potassium binders included calcium polystyrene sulfonate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, patiromer, and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. A range of routes, doses, and timing of drug administration were used. Study duration varied from 12 hours to 52 weeks (median 4 weeks). Three were cross‐over studies. The mean study age ranged from 53.1 years to 73 years. No studies evaluated treatment in children. 
Some studies had methodological domains that were at high or unclear risks of bias, leading to low certainty in the results. Studies were not designed to measure treatment effects on cardiac arrhythmias or major GI symptoms. 
Ten studies (1367 randomised participants) compared a potassium binder to placebo. The certainty of the evidence was low for all outcomes. We categorised treatments in newer agents (patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) and older agents (calcium polystyrene sulfonate and sodium polystyrene sulfonate). Patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate may make little or no difference to death (any cause) (4 studies, 688 participants: RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.11, 4.32; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence) in CKD. The treatment effect of older potassium binders on death (any cause) was unknown. One cardiovascular death was reported with potassium binder in one study, showing that there was no difference between patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and placebo for cardiovascular death in CKD and HD. There was no evidence of a difference between patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and placebo for health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) at the end of treatment (one study) in CKD or HD. Potassium binders had uncertain effects on nausea (3 studies, 229 participants: RR 2.10, 95% CI 0.65, 6.78; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence), diarrhoea (5 studies, 720 participants: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.47, 1.48; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence), and vomiting (2 studies, 122 participants: RR 1.72, 95% CI 0.35 to 8.51; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence) in CKD. Potassium binders may lower serum potassium levels (at the end of treatment) (3 studies, 277 participants: MD ‐0.62 mEq/L, 95% CI ‐0.97, ‐0.27; I2 = 92%; low certainty evidence) in CKD and HD. Potassium binders had uncertain effects on constipation (4 studies, 425 participants: RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.71, 3.52; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence) in CKD. Potassium binders may decrease systolic blood pressure (BP) (2 studies, 369 participants: MD ‐3.73 mmHg, 95%CI ‐6.64 to ‐0.83; I2 = 79%; low certainty evidence) and diastolic BP (one study) at the end of the treatment. No study reported outcome data for cardiac arrhythmias or major GI events. 
Calcium polystyrene sulfonate may make little or no difference to serum potassium levels at end of treatment, compared to sodium polystyrene sulfonate (2 studies, 117 participants: MD 0.38 mEq/L, 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.79; I2 = 42%, low certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in systolic BP (one study), diastolic BP (one study), or constipation (one study) between calcium polystyrene sulfonate and sodium polystyrene sulfonate. 
There was no difference between high‐dose and low‐dose patiromer for death (sudden death) (one study), stroke (one study), myocardial infarction (one study), or constipation (one study). 
The comparative effects whether potassium binders were administered with or without food, laxatives, or sorbitol, were very uncertain with insufficient data to perform meta‐analysis. 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence supporting clinical decision‐making for different potassium binders to treat chronic hyperkalaemia in adults with CKD is of low certainty; no studies were identified in children. Available studies have not been designed to measure treatment effects on clinical outcomes such as cardiac arrhythmias or major GI symptoms. This review suggests the need for a large, adequately powered study of potassium binders versus placebo that assesses clinical outcomes of relevance to patients, clinicians and policy‐makers. This data could be used to assess cost‐effectiveness, given the lack of definitive studies and the clinical importance of potassium binders for chronic hyperkalaemia in people with CKD.

A Review of Medicines for High Blood Potassium in People with Kidney Disease

### **Rationale**

Your kidneys help clean your blood. When you have long-term kidney problems, your kidneys do not work as well. This is called chronic kidney disease.

With kidney disease, a salt in your body called potassium can build up in your blood. High potassium can be dangerous. It can cause serious problems with your heart.

Doctors use medicines to lower high potassium. These medicines are called potassium binders. They work in your gut to grab onto potassium. This helps your body get rid of it. The older types of these medicines can cause stomach problems. For example, they can make it hard to go to the bathroom.

Newer potassium binder medicines are now available. Researchers did this review to see if the new medicines are better or safer than the old ones. They looked at past studies to compare all these medicines. This can help doctors and patients choose the best treatment.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers looked for all the best past studies on this topic. They combined the results from all these studies. This helps to get a bigger picture of what the research shows.

The researchers found 15 studies to review. In total, these studies had about 1,850 adult patients. All the patients had kidney disease. Some of them used a machine to clean their blood, called dialysis. No children were in any of these studies.

In the studies, people took different types of potassium binders. Some people took a placebo. A placebo is a pretend pill with no medicine in it. This helps show if the real medicine is working. People were in the studies for different amounts of time. The time ranged from a few hours to one year. Most studies lasted for about one month.

### **Results**

The main finding was that the evidence from the studies was not very strong. The researchers said the quality of the studies was low. This means we cannot be very sure about the results.

The review looked at important health results. The newer medicines did not seem to change a person’s risk of dying. It was not clear if the older medicines changed this risk. The medicines also did not seem to change how people felt about their own health.

The medicines may have some good effects. They may help to lower potassium levels in the blood. They may also help to lower blood pressure. But because the evidence is not strong, we are not sure about this.

The review also looked at side effects. The researchers were not sure if the medicines caused more gut problems. These problems include feeling sick, throwing up, or having loose stools. They were also not sure if the medicines made it harder to poop.

The researchers believe we need a new, large study. This study should compare the medicines to a placebo. It should also look at results that matter most to patients, like heart problems. This will give us clear answers to help doctors and patients make the best choices.","Are potassium treatments effective for reduce the excess of potassium among people with chronic kidney disease? 
What is the issue? 
High levels of potassium (a body salt) can build up with chronic kidney disease. This can lead to changes in muscle function including the heart muscle, and cause problems with heart rhythms that can be dangerous. Dialysis can remove potassium from the blood, but for some patients levels can still be high. Patients with severe kidney failure who have not yet started dialysis may have high potassium levels. Treatments have been available for many years but can cause constipation and abdominal discomfort, which make them intolerable for many patients. Newer treatments have been developed including patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. These may be more tolerable but it is uncertain whether they help to prevent heart complications. 
What did we do? 
We searched for all the research trials that have assessed the potassium‐lowering treatments for children and adults with chronic kidney diseases. We evaluated how certain we could be about the overall findings using a system called ""GRADE"". 
What did we find? 
There are 15 studies involving 1849 randomised adults. Patients in the studies were given a potassium binder or a dummy pill (placebo) or standard care. The treatment they got was decided by random chance. The studies were generally short‐term over days to weeks and focused on potassium levels. Heart related complications could not be measured in this short time frame. Based on the existing research, we can't be sure whether potassium binders improve well‐being or prevent complications in people with chronic kidney disease. There were no studies in children. 
Conclusions 
We can't be certain about the best treatments to reduce body potassium levels for people with chronic kidney disease. We need more information from clinical studies that involve a larger number of patients who have the treatment over several months or years.

Road traffic suicides are common. However, due to the difficulty in distinguishing between motor vehicle crash fatalities and actual suicides, no official figures exist for this method of suicide. Restricting access to means is an important universal or population‐based approach to suicide prevention with clear evidence of its effectiveness. However, the evidence with respect to means restriction for the prevention of suicide on roads is not well established. We conducted a systematic review to assess the impact of restrictions on the availability of, or access to, means of suicide on roads. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to restrict the availability of, or access to, means of suicide on roads. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Transport Research International Documentation (TRID) Database from the date of database inception to March 2020. We conducted searches of the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify unpublished and ongoing studies. We applied no date, language, or publication status restrictions to these searches. 
Selection criteria
Eligible studies were randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials, controlled intervention studies without randomisation, before‐after studies, or studies using interrupted time series designs, which evaluated interventions to restrict the availability of, or access to, means of suicide on roads. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors screened abstracts and full‐text publications against the inclusion criteria. Two review authors planned to independently extract data and assess risk of bias of included studies. However, we identified no studies eligible for inclusion. 
Main results
We identified no studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review.
Authors' conclusions
This systematic review highlights the paucity of research around road traffic suicides and the need for future robust studies that aim to investigate the effectiveness of interventions to prevent suicide on roads. Suicide ascertainment is a key issue; therefore, clear objective criteria are necessary in order to scale up and study this method more accurately. In the absence of any substantial evidence, we advocate for more awareness on road traffic suicides and its inclusion in future government suicide prevention policies. Further research exploring effective measures, particularly those that do not require driver compliance, are also needed.

Looking for Studies on How to Prevent Suicides on Roads

### **Rationale**

**Why was this study done?**

Some people use car crashes on roads to end their own lives. This is a tragedy for the person, their families, and the community.

It is often very hard to know if a car crash was an accident or a suicide. Because of this, we do not know the true number of people who die this way. This makes it a difficult problem to solve.

One of the best ways to prevent suicide is to make it harder for a person to get the things they might use to harm themselves. This is called “restricting the means.” For example, putting safety nets on high bridges can save lives. We wanted to see if this idea could also work to prevent suicides on roads.

We did this study because there is not much known about how to stop these deaths. We looked for all the research that has ever been done on this topic to see what works. This type of study, where we search for and review all past research, is called a systematic review.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This study did not involve any patients. Instead, it was a large search for all the studies that have already been completed on this topic.

Our team searched in many large online libraries of medical research. We looked for any study that tested a way to prevent suicides on roads. Our search went back to the beginning of these libraries and ended in March 2020. We included studies from any country and in any language.

We were looking for studies with a strong design. For example, we looked for studies that compared what happened before and after a new safety measure was put in place. These types of studies give us the best proof about whether something works.

Two people on our team planned to review all the studies we found. They would check to see if the studies met our rules. They also planned to carefully collect the results from any studies we found.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

Our search for studies was very broad. We looked everywhere we could. However, we did not find any studies that met our rules.

This means that we found zero completed studies that tested ways to prevent suicides on roads.

Because we found no studies, we have no proof from research about what works to stop these sad events. We cannot say what the benefits or risks of any safety measure might be. This review shows there is a large gap in what we know about preventing suicide.

The authors who did this review have some key thoughts. They believe we must do more research on road suicides. We need new, high-quality studies to find ways to prevent these deaths. It is also very important to have clear rules to help police and doctors decide if a crash was a suicide or an accident. This will help us understand how big the problem really is.

Finally, the authors believe governments should include road suicide prevention in their plans to keep people safe. We need to find safety measures that work automatically and do not need a driver to do something. More awareness and research can help us find solutions and save lives.","Means restriction to prevent suicide on roads
Why is this review important? 
Road traffic suicides are difficult to distinguish from motor vehicle crash fatalities and, therefore, no official figures exist for this method of suicide. Limiting access to lethal methods used for suicide (called means restriction) is an important universal or population strategy for preventing suicide. While there is evidence that means restriction is an effective approach for preventing suicides, the evidence for preventing suicide on roads is not well established. Therefore, this review aimed to explore the impact restriction of access would have on suicide on roads. 
Searching for evidence 
We searched several medical databases to find studies that assessed the impact of restricting access to means of suicide on roads. We searched the databases up to March 2020. We also searched international trial registries for unpublished and ongoing studies. Our main outcomes of interest were suicide and attempted suicide or self‐harm. 
Key results 
We found no studies eligible for inclusion in the review. As a result, we cannot draw any conclusions as to the effectiveness of means restriction interventions for the prevention of suicide on roads. Determining suicidal intent is a major problem in road crash fatalities, therefore clear objective criteria are necessary in order to scale up, study and understand this method of suicide more accurately. Improved awareness of suicide on roads in suicide prevention activities is needed, as well as, its inclusion in future government suicide prevention policies. Robust studies investigating the effectiveness of interventions to prevent suicide on roads are urgently required

Many millions of people living with dementia around the world are not diagnosed, which has a negative impact both on their access to care and treatment and on rational service planning. Telehealth ‐ the use of information and communication technology (ICT) to provide health services at a distance ‐ may be a way to increase access to specialist assessment for people with suspected dementia, especially those living in remote or rural areas. It has also been much used during the COVID‐19 pandemic. It is important to know whether diagnoses made using telehealth assessment are as accurate as those made in conventional, face‐to‐face clinical settings. 
Objectives
Primary objective: to assess the diagnostic accuracy of telehealth assessment for dementia and mild cognitive impairment. 
Secondary objectives: to identify the quality and quantity of the relevant research evidence; to identify sources of heterogeneity in the test accuracy data; to identify and synthesise any data on patient or clinician satisfaction, resource use, costs or feasibility of the telehealth assessment models in the included studies. 
Search methods
We searched multiple databases and clinical trial registers on 4 November 2020 for published and 'grey' literature and registered trials. We applied no search filters and no language restrictions. We screened the retrieved citations in duplicate and assessed in duplicate the full texts of papers considered potentially relevant. 
Selection criteria
We included in the review cross‐sectional studies with 10 or more participants who had been referred to a specialist service for assessment of a suspected cognitive disorder. Within a period of one month or less, each participant had to undergo two clinical assessments designed to diagnose dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI): a telehealth assessment (the index test) and a conventional face‐to‐face assessment (the reference standard). The telehealth assessment could be informed by some data collected face‐to‐face, e.g. by nurses working in primary care, but all contact between the patient and the specialist clinician responsible for synthesising the information and making the diagnosis had to take place remotely using ICT. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data from included studies. Data extracted covered study design, setting, participants, details of index test and reference standard, and results in the form of numbers of participants given diagnoses of dementia or MCI. Data were also sought on dementia subtype diagnoses and on quantitative measures of patient or clinician satisfaction, resource use, costs and feasibility. We assessed risk of bias and applicability of each included study using QUADAS‐2. We entered the results into 2x2 tables in order to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of telehealth assessment for the diagnosis of all‐cause dementia, MCI, and any cognitive syndrome (combining dementia and MCI). We presented the results of included studies narratively because there were too few studies to derive summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity. 
Main results
Three studies with 136 participants were eligible for inclusion. Two studies (20 and 100 participants) took place in community settings in Australia and one study (16 participants) was conducted in veterans' homes in the USA. Participants were referred from primary care with undiagnosed cognitive symptoms or were identified as being at high risk of having dementia on a screening test in the care homes. Dementia and MCI were target conditions in the larger study; the other studies targeted dementia diagnosis only. Only one small study used a 'pure' telehealth model, i.e. not involving any elements of face‐to‐face assessment. 
The studies were generally well‐conducted. We considered two studies to be at high risk of incorporation bias because a substantial amount of information collected face‐to‐face by nurses was used to inform both index test and reference standard assessments. One study was at unclear risk of selection bias. 
For the diagnosis of all‐cause dementia, sensitivity of telehealth assessment ranged from 0.80 to 1.00 and specificity from 0.80 to 1.00. We considered this to be very low‐certainty evidence due to imprecision, inconsistency between studies and risk of bias. For the diagnosis of MCI, data were available from only one study (100 participants) giving a sensitivity of 0.71 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.84) and a specificity of 0.73 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.84). We considered this to be low‐certainty evidence due to imprecision and risk of bias. For diagnosis of any cognitive syndrome (dementia or MCI), data from the same study gave a sensitivity of 0.97 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.99) and a specificity of 0.22 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.60). The majority of diagnostic disagreements concerned the distinction between MCI and dementia, occurring approximately equally in either direction. There was also a tendency for patients identified as cognitively healthy at face‐to‐face assessment to be diagnosed with MCI at telehealth assessment (but numbers were small). 
There were insufficient data to make any assessment of the accuracy of dementia subtype diagnosis. 
One study provided a small amount of data indicating a good level of clinician and especially patient satisfaction with the telehealth model. There were no data on resource use, costs or feasibility. 
Authors' conclusions
We found only very few eligible studies with a small number of participants. An important difference between the studies providing data for the analyses was whether the target condition was dementia only (two studies) or dementia and MCI (one study). The data suggest that telehealth assessment may be highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of all‐cause dementia when assessed against a reference standard of conventional face‐to‐face assessment, but the estimates are imprecise due to small sample sizes and between‐study heterogeneity, and may apply mainly to telehealth models which incorporate a considerable amount of face‐to‐face contact with healthcare professionals other than the doctor responsible for making the diagnosis. For the diagnosis of MCI by telehealth assessment, best estimates of both sensitivity and specificity were somewhat lower, but were based on a single study. Errors occurred at the cognitively healthy/MCI and the MCI/dementia boundaries. However, there is no evidence that diagnostic disagreements were more frequent than would be expected due to the known variation between clinicians’ opinions when assigning a dementia diagnosis.

Can Online Visits Help Doctors Find Memory Problems?

### **Rationale**

Dementia is a health problem that affects a person's memory and thinking. Many people with dementia around the world do not have a diagnosis. When a person does not have a diagnosis, it is hard for them to get the right care and support.

Online visits with a doctor are sometimes called telehealth. This means you can use a computer or phone to talk to a doctor from your home. Telehealth can help people who live far away from a specialist doctor. It was also used a lot during the recent health crisis.

Doctors wanted to know if online visits work as well as in-person visits to find memory problems. It is important to know if a diagnosis from an online visit is correct. This study looked at past research to find out if online visits are a good way to diagnose dementia and other mild memory problems.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers searched for all the studies that were already done on this topic. They wanted to bring all the results together to get a better answer.

The researchers found 3 studies that met their rules. These studies included a total of 136 people from Australia and the United States. All the people in these studies were worried about their memory and thinking. They were sent to a specialist to get checked.

In each of the studies, every person had two check-ups. One check-up was an online video call with a specialist doctor. The other check-up was a normal, face-to-face visit with a doctor. The doctors then compared the results from both types of visits to see if they matched. This helped them see how accurate the online visits were.

### **Results**

The results showed that online visits seemed to be good at finding dementia. For every 10 people who had dementia in the studies, the online visits correctly found between 8 and 10 of them. The online visits were also good at correctly telling who did not have dementia.

However, the researchers said we should be careful with these results. This is because they only found 3 studies, and these studies were very small. Because the studies were small and done in different ways, the researchers are not very sure about the results.

The studies also looked at milder memory problems. For these milder problems, the online visits were a bit less accurate. They found about 7 out of 10 people who had these mild problems. Most of the mistakes happened when doctors tried to tell the difference between a mild memory problem and dementia.

One study showed that patients and doctors liked using the online visits. There was not enough information in the studies to know about the cost or ease of using online visits.

The researchers who did this review concluded that we need more research. Online visits might be a good way to check for dementia, but we need bigger and better studies to be sure. The results from this review are a good first step.","Accuracy of telehealth assessment for diagnosing dementia and mild cognitive impairment
Background 
Dementia is an illness in which memory and other thinking skills deteriorate to the point that someone can no longer manage their daily activities without assistance. If the memory and thinking problems are milder, so that independent living is not affected, the condition is described as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Both conditions usually affect older people. It is considered important that people with dementia or MCI can get an accurate diagnosis at a time and place suitable for them so that they and their families can understand the problem and can access treatment and support. However millions of people with dementia around the world never get a diagnosis. There are many reasons for this, but one may be a lack of accessible diagnostic services, particularly for people in rural areas or those who find it difficult to travel. During the COVID‐19 pandemic, many face‐to‐face services were closed. Telehealth ‐ the use of information and communication technology (ICT) to provide health services at a distance may be a way to increase access to specialist assessment for people with suspected dementia who cannot easily get to clinics. However, it is important to be sure that increased accessibility does not come at the expense of accuracy of diagnosis. 
Review question 
We asked how accurate telehealth diagnoses of dementia and MCI were compared to diagnoses made when patients attend traditional clinics for a face‐to‐face assessment. 
What we did 
We searched databases of medical studies up to 4 November 2020 for studies in which people had two assessments for suspected dementia or MCI: one telehealth assessment and one conventional face‐to‐face assessment. Both assessments were done by specialists and took place within a month of each other. For the telehealth assessment, all contact between the patient and the diagnosing specialist had to have been done remotely, using ICT, but some of the information needed to make the diagnosis could be collected by other members of the healthcare team who saw the patient in person. We then assessed how closely the results of the telehealth assessments agreed with the face‐to‐face assessments. 
What we found 
We included three studies (136 participants) who had suspected dementia. One small study (16 participants) was conducted in veterans' homes in the USA; the other two studies were in community services in Australia. They all used videoconference systems for their telehealth assessments. All three studies aimed to make dementia diagnoses but only one also aimed to diagnose MCI. The quality of the studies was generally good. In two studies, nurses who saw the patients in person played a big role in gathering information used in both assessments, which could bias those studies towards close agreement between the assessments. 
The studies found that telehealth assessment correctly identified 80% to 100% of the people who were diagnosed with dementia at face‐to‐face assessment and also correctly identified 80% to 100% of people who did not have dementia. 
Only one study (100 participants) attempted to diagnose MCI. In this study, 71% of participants who had MCI and 73% of participants who did not have MCI were correctly identified using telehealth assessment. 
Telehealth assessment in this study correctly identified 97% of the participants who had either MCI or dementia, but correctly identified only 22% of those who did not have either, although again this result was very uncertain because of the very small number of people in this category. 
It is important to note that diagnoses of dementia and MCI made by two specialists seeing patients face‐to‐face will not show 100% agreement. Therefore perfect agreement between telehealth and face‐to‐face assessments cannot be expected. 
What we concluded 
From the evidence we found, telehealth assessment for diagnosing dementia seems to have a good level of accuracy when compared to face‐to‐face assessment, although the small number of studies and participants and differences between the included studies means that there is a lot of uncertainty about this result. Telehealth appeared to be a little less accurate for diagnosing MCI than for diagnosing dementia. Agreement between two face‐to‐face assessments is also not perfect and we cannot say that disagreements between telehealth and face‐to‐face diagnoses were any more common.

10.1002-14651858.CD013697.pub2,"Background
Posterior blepharitis is common and causes ocular surface and lid damage as well as discomfort. It affects 37% to 47% of all ophthalmology patients; its incidence increasing with age. It is a multifactorial disease associated with multiple other pathologies, such as rosacea, meibomianitis, and infections. Treatment usually focuses on reliefing the symptoms by using artificial tears, lid scrubs, and warm compresses. The condition may be notoriously difficult to manage adequately once it becomes chronic. One such management approach for chronic blepharitis is the use of oral antibiotics for both their antibacterial as well as anti‐inflammatory properties. There are currently no guidelines regarding the use of oral antibiotics, including antibiotic type, dosage, and treatment duration, for the treatment of chronic blepharitis. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of oral antibiotic use for people with chronic blepharitis.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2020, Issue 8); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 29 August 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral antibiotics with placebo in adult participants with chronic blepharitis (including staphylococcal, seborrhoeic, or Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD)). 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodology and graded the certainty of the body of evidence for six outcomes using the GRADE classification. 
Main results
We included two studies with 220 participants (numbers of eyes unclear). One parallel‐group RCT comparing oral doxycycline (40 mg once a day) with placebo enrolled 70 participants with blepharitis and facial rosacea in the USA. Follow‐up duration was three months. One three‐arm RCT conducted in South Korea investigated the effect of high‐dose (200 mg twice a day) and low‐dose (20 mg twice a day) doxycycline versus placebo after one month of study medication. It enrolled 50 participants with chronic MGD in each study arm (i.e. 150 participants enrolled in total). 
The two studies did not evaluate the same outcome measurements, which precluded any meta‐analysis. The evidence for the effect of oral antibiotics on subjective improvement in symptoms was very uncertain. One study suggested that there was little to no effect of oral doxycycline on subjective symptoms based on the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) scores ranging from 0 to 100 (higher score indicates worse condition) (mean difference (MD) 3.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) −4.61 to 11.71; n = 70) and bulbar conjunctival hyperemia ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe) (MD −0.01, 95% CI −0.38 to 0.36; n = 70) at 12 weeks. The three‐arm RCT showed that oral doxycycline may slightly improve number of symptoms (MD −0.56, 95% CI −0.95 to −0.17; n = 93 (high‐dose doxycycline versus placebo); MD −0.48, 95% CI −0.86 to −0.10; n = 93 (low‐dose doxycycline versus placebo)) and proportion of participants with symptom improvement (risk ratio (RR) 6.13, 95% CI 2.61 to 14.42; n = 93 (high‐dose doxycycline versus placebo); RR 6.54, 95% CI 2.79 to 15.30; n = 93 (low‐dose doxycycline versus placebo)) at one month, but the evidence is very uncertain. We judged the certainty of evidence for subjective symptoms as very low. 
One study evaluated aqueous tear production by Schirmer's test (mm/5 min) (higher score indicates better condition) and tear film stability by measuring tear film break‐up time (TBUT) in seconds (higher score indicates better condition) at one month. We found very low certainty evidence that oral doxycycline may improve these clinical signs. The estimated MD in Schirmer's test score after one month of treatment was 4.09 mm (95% CI 2.38 to 5.80; n = 93) in the high‐dose doxycycline group versus the placebo group and 3.76 mm (95% CI 1.85 to 5.67; n = 93) in the low‐dose doxycycline group versus the placebo group. The estimated MD in TBUT after one month was 1.58 seconds (95% CI 0.57 to 2.59; n = 93) when comparing the high‐dose doxycycline group with the placebo group, and 1.70 seconds (95% CI 0.96 to 2.44; n = 93) when comparing the low‐dose doxycycline group with the placebo group. Although there was a noted improvement in these scores, their clinical importance remains uncertain. 
One study suggested that oral doxycycline may increase the incidence of serious side effects: 18 (39%) participants in the high‐dose doxycycline group, 8 (17%) in the low‐dose doxycycline group, and 3 (6%) out of 47 participants in the placebo group experienced serious side effects (RR 6.13, 95% CI 1.94 to 19.41; n = 93 (high‐dose doxycycline versus placebo); RR 2.72, 95% CI 0.77 to 9.64; n = 93 (low‐dose doxycycline versus placebo)). Additionally, one study reported that one case of migraine headache and five cases of headache were observed in the oral doxycycline group, and one case of non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma was observed in the placebo group. We judged the certainty of evidence for adverse events as very low. 
Authors' conclusions
There was insufficient evidence to draw any meaningful conclusions on the use of oral antibiotics for chronic blepharitis. Very low certainty evidence suggests that oral antibiotics may improve clinical signs, but may cause more adverse events. The evidence for the effect of oral antibiotics on subjective symptoms is very uncertain. Further trials are needed to provide high quality evidence on the use of oral antibiotics in the treatment of chronic blepharitis.

Do Pills with Antibiotics Help Treat Long-Term Eyelid Swelling?

### **Rationale**

Many people have a condition called blepharitis. This is a long-term problem with the eyelids. It can make them red, swollen, and sore. It can also make your eyes feel dry or gritty. This problem is common and can be hard to live with.

Doctors often suggest simple treatments to help you feel better. These include using special eye drops, cleaning your eyelids, or using a warm cloth on your eyes. These treatments can help with the symptoms. But they may not fix the problem when it lasts for a long time.

Some doctors use antibiotic pills to treat long-term blepharitis. These pills can fight germs that may cause the problem. They can also help reduce the swelling in the eyelids. But we do not have clear rules for doctors on how to use these pills. We don’t know which antibiotic is best, how much to give, or for how long.

This review looked at past research. The goal was to find out if antibiotic pills are a good and safe treatment for people with long-term eyelid swelling.

### **Trial Design**

The researchers did not run a new study with new patients. Instead, they looked for and reviewed the results from older studies. This helps to bring all the information together in one place.

The researchers looked for a special type of study. These studies put people into groups by chance. One group gets the real medicine. Another group gets a placebo. A placebo is a pill that looks real but has no medicine in it. This is the best way to see if a medicine really works.

The researchers found two studies to review. In total, these studies included 220 adults who all had long-term eyelid swelling.

One study was done in the USA and lasted for 3 months. In this study, people took a low-dose antibiotic pill or a placebo pill once a day.

The other study was done in South Korea and lasted for 1 month. It had three groups. One group took a high dose of the antibiotic. A second group took a low dose of the antibiotic. The third group took a placebo.

### **Results**

The researchers found there was not enough good information to say for sure if antibiotic pills work. The proof from the two studies they looked at was very weak.

**How Patients Felt**
It was not clear if the antibiotic pills helped people feel better. In one study, the pills did not seem to help much with eye soreness or redness. In the other study, the pills seemed to help a little bit. Because the two studies had different results, the researchers could not be sure if the pills truly helped people’s symptoms.

**What Doctors Found in Eye Tests**
One study tested how well the eyes were working. It checked how many tears people made. It also checked how long tears stayed on the eye to keep it moist.

The antibiotic pills seemed to help improve the results of these tests. This was true for both the high dose and low dose of the pills. But, the researchers were not sure if this small improvement made a real difference in how a person's eyes feel day to day.

**Side Effects**
The antibiotic pills may cause more side effects than the placebo pills. In one study, more people who took the antibiotic had serious problems.

About 18 out of 47 people who took a high dose had serious side effects. About 8 out of 47 people who took a low dose had serious side effects. This compares to 3 out of 47 people who took the placebo pill. Other side effects like headaches were also seen in people who took the antibiotic.

**Conclusions from the Researchers**
The authors of this review concluded that we need more research. The proof we have now is not strong enough to know if antibiotic pills are a good or safe choice for long-term eyelid swelling.

The weak proof suggests the pills might help improve some eye test results. But they may also cause more side effects. We are still not sure if they help people feel better. Better and larger studies are needed in the future. This will help doctors and patients make the best choices for treating this condition.","Treating long‐lasting blepharitis (swollen and itchy eyelids): how well do antibiotics (medicines that kill bacteria) work when taken by mouth (orally)? 
Key messages· We did not find enough evidence to show how well antibiotics taken by mouth can treat long‐lasting blepharitis. 
· One antibiotic tested may improve some clinical aspects (symptoms and course of the disease), but we are uncertain about its benefit in this respect, and it may also cause a higher number of unwanted effects. 
· More studies are needed to find out how well antibiotics taken by mouth can treat long‐lasting blepharitis. 
What is blepharitis?Blepharitis is a common condition affecting the eyes. It causes swelling and redness on the edges of the eyelids, making them feel sore, and an itching or a gritty feeling in the eyes. The most common causes of blepharitis are infection by a type of bacteria that lives on the surface of the eye, or skin conditions such as dermatitis. 
How is blepharitis treated?Blepharitis is usually treated by regularly cleaning the eyelids, or using a cream or eye drops containing an antibiotic (a type of medicine that kills bacteria). If these do not work, then taking antibiotics by mouth (orally) is often tried. However, there are no guidelines about which type of antibiotic to give, what dose to use, or how long treatment should last. 
What did we want to find out?We wanted to find out how well antibiotics given by mouth can treat long‐lasting blepharitis. 
What did we do?We searched for studies that tested antibiotics given by mouth to treat long‐lasting blepharitis. 
What did we find?We found 2 studies in 220 adults with long‐lasting blepharitis. One study took place in the USA and lasted for three months; it tested the antibiotic doxycycline compared to placebo treatment (a 'dummy' treatment that does not contain any medicine but looks identical to the medicine being tested). The other study took place in South Korea and tested the effects of high or low doses of doxycycline compared to placebo treatment. 
One study was funded by a pharmaceutical company; the other study did not report a source of funding. The studies measured results of treatment in different ways, so it was not possible to combine the studies' results to analyse them together. 
What are the main results of our review?We are uncertain about the effects of doxycycline on symptoms such as itching, burning, and watery eyes, as evaluated by people taking part in the studies. 
One study measured changes in how much an affected eye watered (produced tears) before and after one month of treatment. High‐ and low‐dose doxycycline may improve the eye's ability to produce tears (evidence from 1 study with 93 people in each dose group). 
One study evaluated dryness of the eye by measuring the time it took for a dry spot to appear on the surface of the eye after blinking (the 'tear film break‐up time'). Taking doxycycline (high‐ and low‐dose) for one month may improve problems with dryness (evidence from 1 study with 93 people in each dose group). 
Taking doxycycline for one month may cause more unwanted effects than taking a placebo (evidence from 1 study in 139 people). The number of unwanted effects reported was higher in the high‐dose doxycycline group. 
No studies measured:
· how many bacteria were present in the eye before or after treatment;
· people's well‐being (quality of life); or
· the costs and benefits of the treatments tested.
What are the limitations of the evidence?We have very low confidence in the evidence because of limitations in the ways the studies were conducted, and because the results of the studies varied widely and were inconsistent. One study was funded by a pharmaceutical company, which could have affected the way the study was designed, conducted, and reported. Further research is likely to change and increase our confidence in the results. 
How up‐to‐date is the evidence?The evidence is current up to 29 August 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD013336,"Extended versus standard lymph node dissection in patients with bladder cancer undergoing total bladder removal 
Review question 
When removing the whole bladder for bladder cancer, how does removing the lymph nodes from a large area (extended lymph node dissection) compare to only from a smaller area (standard lymph node dissection)? 
Background 
People with advanced cancer of the bladder that has spread into the deep muscle layers (but not outside the bladder) often have an operation to remove the whole bladder. As part of this operation, surgeons remove lymph nodes in that part of the body, which is an important part of the immune system. Traditionally, only the lymph nodes close to the bladder and its major blood vessels were removed. This is called a standard lymph node dissection which removes lymph nodes as high up as to where the main blood vessels for the pelvis and the leg split up. Some people think that also removing lymph nodes further away from the bladder is better in getting rid of cancer. This is called an extended lymph node dissection. It removes lymph nodes as high up as the blood vessels that supply the lower part of the intestines. We don't know whether this indeed helps people live longer and not die from bladder cancer and how the unwanted effects compare. 
Study characteristics 
We included only studies in which chance determined whether people got a standard or extended lymph node dissection that was reported in literature up to April 29, 2019. 
Key results 
We found only one such study that answered our review question. This study was done at 16 large hospitals in Germany and included 401 men and women with bladder cancer. 
We found that having an extended node dissection may make people less likely to die for any reason or to die from bladder cancer over time, although our confidence in this result is limited. 
We are uncertain whether an extended node dissection causes more serious unwanted effects than a standard lymph node dissection. 
We are also uncertain whether an extended node dissection makes cancer less likely to come back over time and causes a similar risk of not‐so‐serious unwanted effects compared to a standard lymph node dissection. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of evidence for these findings was low or very low, meaning that the true outcomes may be very different from what this review found.

Does Removing More Glands During Bladder Cancer Surgery Help Patients?

**Rationale**

Bladder cancer is a disease where harmful cells grow in the bladder. The bladder is the organ in your lower belly that holds urine. When this cancer grows deep into the bladder wall, doctors often need to do a big surgery. This surgery removes the whole bladder to get rid of the cancer.

During this surgery, doctors also remove small glands called lymph nodes. These glands are part of the body’s system to fight sickness. Removing them helps doctors know if the cancer has spread. It can also help remove cancer cells that have already spread.

For a long time, doctors removed the glands closest to the bladder. This is called a ""standard"" removal. Some doctors now think that removing more glands from a larger area might be better. This is called an ""extended"" removal. The idea is that removing more glands could get rid of more hidden cancer cells.

This could help people live longer. But doing a bigger surgery could also cause more problems or side effects. This study was needed to see if removing more glands is truly better and safer for patients.

**Trial Design**

This paper is a summary of the best available research. The authors looked for studies that compared the two types of surgery. They found only one good study that answered their question.

This study took place in 16 large hospitals in Germany. It included 401 men and women who had bladder cancer.

The study was designed to be very fair. A computer put each person into one of two groups by chance, like flipping a coin.

*   One group had the standard surgery to remove a smaller area of glands.
*   The other group had the extended surgery to remove a larger area of glands.

Researchers then followed both groups over time. They watched to see how they did after the surgery.

**Results**

The study found that removing more glands might help people live longer. Patients who had more glands removed seemed less likely to die from any cause, including bladder cancer.

However, the researchers are not very sure about this result. The proof from this one study was not very strong.

The study did not give clear answers about side effects. The researchers are uncertain if the bigger surgery causes more serious problems. They are also not sure if the risk of less serious side effects is the same for both types of surgery.

Finally, the researchers are uncertain if removing more glands helps stop the cancer from coming back later.

In the end, the authors concluded that the proof is weak. The results from this one study may not be the true answer. More and better research is needed to know for sure which type of surgery is best for people with bladder cancer.","Extended versus standard lymph node dissection in patients with bladder cancer undergoing total bladder removal

10.1002-14651858.CD013206.pub2,"Background
Eczema is a common and chronic, relapsing, inflammatory skin disorder. It seriously impacts quality of life and economic outcomes, especially for those with moderate to severe eczema. Various treatments allow sustained control of the disease; however, their relative benefit remains unclear due to the limited number of trials directly comparing treatments. 
Objectives
To assess the comparative efficacy and safety of different types of systemic immunosuppressive treatments for moderate to severe eczema using NMA and to generate rankings of available systemic immunosuppressive treatments for eczema according to their efficacy and safety. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases up to August 2019: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of systemic immunosuppressive agents for moderate to severe atopic eczema when compared against placebo or any other eligible eczema treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
We synthesised data using pair‐wise analysis and NMA to compare treatments and rank them according to their effectiveness. 
Effectiveness was assessed primarily by determining the proportion of participants who achieved at least 75% improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI75) and improvement in the Patient‐Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM). Safety was evaluated primarily by considering the proportion of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs) and infection. 
We deemed short‐term follow‐up as ≤ 16 weeks and long‐term follow‐up as > 16 weeks.
We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence from the NMA for these primary outcomes using six domains of CiNEMA grading. 
Main results
We included a total of 74 studies, with 8177 randomised participants. Approximately 55% of participants were male, with average age of 32 years (range 2 to 84 years), although age and gender were unreported for 419 and 902 participants, respectively. Most of the included trials were placebo controlled (65%), 34% were head‐to‐head studies (15% assessed the effects of different doses of the same drug), and 1% were multi‐armed studies with both an active comparator and a placebo. 
All trials included participants with moderate to severe eczema, but 62% of studies did not separate data by severity; 38% of studies assessed only severe eczema. The total duration of included trials ranged from 2 weeks to 60 months, whereas treatment duration varied from a single dose (CIM331, KPL‐716) to 60 months (methotrexate (MTX)). 
Seventy studies were available for quantitative synthesis; this review assessed 29 immunosuppressive agents from three classes of interventions. These included (1) conventional treatments, with ciclosporin assessed most commonly; (2) small molecule treatments, including phosphodiesterase (PDE)‐4 inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors; and (3) biological treatments, including anti‐CD31 receptors, anti‐interleukin (IL)‐22, anti‐IL‐31, anti‐IL‐13, anti‐IL‐12/23p40, anti‐OX40, anti‐TSLP, anti‐CRTH2, and anti‐immunoglobulin E (IgE) monoclonal antibodies, but most commonly dupilumab. 
Most trials (73) assessed outcomes at a short‐term duration ranging from 2 to 16 weeks, whereas 33 trials assessed long‐term outcomes, with duration ranging from 5 to 60 months. All participants were from a hospital setting. Fifty‐two studies declared a source of funding, and of these, pharmaceutical companies funded 88%. We rated 37 studies as high risk; 21, unclear risk, and 16, low risk of bias, with studies most commonly at high risk of attrition bias. 
Network meta‐analysis suggests that dupilumab ranks first for effectiveness when compared with other biological treatments. Dupilumab is more effective than placebo in achieving EASI75 (risk ratio (RR) 3.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.51 to 3.69) and improvement in POEM score (mean difference 7.30, 95% CI 6.61 to 8.00) at short‐term follow‐up (high‐certainty evidence). 
Very low‐certainty evidence means we are uncertain of the effects of dupilumab when compared with placebo, in terms of the proportion of participants who achieve EASI75 (RR 2.59, 95% CI 1.87 to 3.60) at longer‐term follow‐up. 
Low‐certainty evidence indicates that tralokinumab may be more effective than placebo in achieving short‐term EASI75 (RR 2.54, 95% CI 1.21 to 5.34), but there was no evidence for tralokinumab to allow us to assess short‐term follow‐up of POEM or long‐term follow‐up of EASI75. 
We are uncertain of the effect of ustekinumab compared with placebo in achieving EASI75 (long‐term follow‐up: RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.40 to 3.45; short‐term follow‐up: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.97; both very low certainty). We found no evidence on ustekinumab for the POEM outcome. 
We are uncertain whether other immunosuppressive agents that targeted our key outcomes influence the achievement of short‐term EASI75 compared with placebo due to low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence. 
Dupilumab and ustekinumab were the only immunosuppressive agents evaluated for longer‐term EASI75. Dupilumab was the only agent evaluated for improvement in POEM during short‐term follow‐up. 
Low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence indicates a lower proportion of participants with SAEs after treatment with QAW039 and dupilumab compared to placebo during short‐term follow‐up, but low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence suggests no difference in SAEs during short‐term follow‐up of other immunosuppressive agents compared to placebo. 
Evidence for effects of immunosuppressive agents on risk of any infection during short‐term follow‐up and SAEs during long‐term follow‐up compared with placebo was of low or very low certainty but did not indicate a difference. 
We did not identify differences in other adverse events (AEs), but dupilumab is associated with specific AEs, including eye inflammation and eosinophilia. 
Authors' conclusions
Our findings indicate that dupilumab is the most effective biological treatment for eczema. Compared to placebo, dupilumab reduces eczema signs and symptoms in the short term for people with moderate to severe atopic eczema. Short‐term safety outcomes from clinical trials did not reveal new safety concerns with dupilumab. Overall, evidence for the efficacy of most other immunosuppressive treatments for moderate to severe atopic eczema is of low or very low certainty. 
Given the lack of data comparing conventional with newer biological treatments for the primary outcomes, there remains high uncertainty for ranking the efficacy and safety of conventional treatments such as ciclosporin and biological treatments such as dupilumab. 
Most studies were placebo‐controlled and assessed only short‐term efficacy of immunosuppressive agents. Further adequately powered head‐to‐head RCTs should evaluate comparative long‐term efficacy and safety of available treatments for moderate to severe eczema.

Comparing Medicines for Moderate to Severe Eczema

### **Rationale**

Eczema is a long-term skin problem that can make your skin red, dry, and very itchy. The problem can come and go over time. When eczema is moderate to severe, it can be hard to live with. It can affect your sleep and your daily life.

There are many different medicines to treat severe eczema. These medicines work by calming down your body’s defense system, called the immune system. This helps reduce the redness and itching.

But doctors do not always know which medicine is the best one to use. This is because very few studies have compared these drugs directly to each other. The goal of this research was to look at many past studies. By combining the results, researchers wanted to find out which medicines work best and are safest for people with moderate to severe eczema.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers found and reviewed 74 past studies. This is a special type of review that lets researchers compare many different treatments at once.

The past studies included over 8,000 people who had moderate to severe eczema. The average age of the people in the studies was 32. Both men and women took part.

In the original studies, people were split into groups by chance. Some groups got a real medicine. Other groups got a placebo. A placebo is a dummy pill or shot that has no medicine in it. Using a placebo helps to show if the real medicine is actually working. The studies lasted for different amounts of time. Some were short, lasting up to 4 months. Others were much longer, lasting up to 5 years.

### **Results**

The researchers looked at 29 different medicines for eczema. After looking at all the studies, they found that one medicine, called dupilumab, seems to be the most helpful.

In the first 4 months of treatment, people who took dupilumab saw good results. They were about 3 times more likely to have a big improvement in their skin compared to those who took a placebo. A big improvement means their skin was at least 75% clearer. People who took dupilumab also said their eczema symptoms bothered them a lot less.

The researchers are very sure about these short-term results. They are less sure about how well dupilumab works over a long time because there was not as much information.

For most of the other medicines, the researchers could not be sure how well they worked. There was not enough clear information from the studies to make strong conclusions.

The study also looked at safety. In the short-term, dupilumab did not seem to cause more serious side effects than the placebo. Some known side effects of dupilumab include eye inflammation, which is like redness or swelling in the eye.

The main conclusion from the researchers is that dupilumab is a good and effective treatment for moderate to severe eczema in the short term. It helps reduce the signs of eczema and makes people feel better. However, more studies are needed. We need more studies that compare the newer drugs, like dupilumab, directly against the older drugs. We also need to learn more about how well and how safe all of these medicines are when used for a long time.","Which oral or injected medicines work best to treat moderate to severe eczema?
Why this question is important 
Eczema is a persistent condition that causes dry, cracked, and itchy skin. People with mild eczema have small patches of dry skin, and people with moderate eczema have larger, redder, or swollen areas of skin. People with severe eczema have red crusts and broken skin (which may ooze fluid) that develop all over the body. 
Although there is currently no cure for eczema, treatments that aim to relieve symptoms are available. Usually, the first treatment option is to apply creams, ointments, or liquids to the affected skin. If this does not work, it is possible to take oral or injected (systemic) medicines that work throughout the body. 
Many systemic medicines are available for eczema. To help people decide which one is most appropriate for managing their symptoms, we reviewed the evidence on benefits and risks of different systemic medicines for people with moderate or severe eczema. We particularly wanted to find out: 
• whether some medicines were more likely than others to have an important positive effect on symptoms (defined as either at least a 75% improvement on the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), or improvement on the Patient‐Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM)—two scales that are used by clinicians to evaluate changes in eczema symptoms); and 
• whether some medicines are associated with more serious unwanted events, including infection, than others. 
How we identified and assessed the evidence 
First, we searched the medical literature for randomised controlled studies (studies where people are randomly divided into different treatment groups) because these studies provide the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We then compared study results and summarised the evidence from all studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, the size of studies, and the consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate, or high certainty. 
What we found 
We found 74 studies that involved a total of 8177 people with moderate to severe eczema. Studies lasted between 2 weeks and 60 months. Treatments received varied from a single, one‐off dose to weekly doses for 60 months. These studies evaluated 29 different medicines by comparing them to a placebo (fake treatment) or to another medicine, or by comparing different doses of the same medicine. The medicine that was studied most frequently was dupilumab (12 studies), a laboratory‐made version of a protein, which blocks parts of the immune system involved in causing eczema. 
Dupilumab versus placebo 
High‐certainty evidence shows that, compared to a placebo or other laboratory‐made proteins, dupilumab improves the symptoms of people with moderate to severe eczema in the short term (within 16 weeks of treatment). It is unclear whether this improvement is sustained after 16 weeks because no studies have looked at changes in POEM scores beyond that time, and because the evidence from studies that measured EASI scores was of very low certainty. Dupilumab may be associated with fewer serious unwanted events than placebo (low‐certainty evidence). 
Other systemic medicines versus placebo 
Evidence on the benefits and risks of other systemic medicines compared to placebo is limited because no studies have measured their effects on symptom improvement or serious unwanted effects, or because the certainty of the evidence is low or very low. 
Comparing different systemic medicines with one another 
Reviewers found too few studies that compared different systemic medicines against one another to determine which worked best for people with moderate to severe eczema. 
What this means 
Evidence shows that, compared to placebo, dupilumab improves the symptoms of people with moderate to severe eczema within 16 weeks of treatment and may be associated with fewer serious unwanted events. 
Reviewers found too few robust studies to conclude whether dupilumab improves symptoms beyond 16 weeks, or whether this medicine works better than older systemic medicines. Future studies need to compare different systemic treatments beyond 16 weeks in people with moderate to severe eczema.

10.1002-14651858.CD013198.pub2,"Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation. Acute exacerbations punctuate the natural history of COPD and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality and disease progression. Chronic airflow limitation is caused by a combination of small airways (bronchitis) and parenchymal destruction (emphysema), which can impact day‐to‐day activities and overall quality of life. In carefully selected patients with COPD, long‐term, prophylactic use of antibiotics may reduce bacterial load, inflammation of the airways, and the frequency of exacerbations. 
Objectives
To assess effects of different prophylactic antibiotics on exacerbations, quality of life, and serious adverse events in people with COPD in three separate network meta‐analyses (NMAs), and to provide rankings of identified antibiotics. 
Search methods
To identify eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs), we searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials and clinical trials registries. We conducted the most recent search on 22 January 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs with a parallel design of at least 12 weeks' duration evaluating long‐term administration of antibiotics prophylactically compared with other antibiotics, or placebo, for patients with COPD. 
Data collection and analysis
This Cochrane Review collected and updated pair‐wise data from two previous Cochrane Reviews. Searches were updated and additional studies included. We conducted three separate network meta‐analyses (NMAs) within a Bayesian framework to assess three outcomes: exacerbations, quality of life, and serious adverse events. For quality of life, we collected data from St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Using previously validated methods, we selected the simplest model that could adequately fit the data for every analysis. We used threshold analysis to indicate which results were robust to potential biases, taking into account each study’s contributions to the overall results and network structure. Probability ranking was performed for each antibiotic class for exacerbations, quality of life, and serious adverse events. 
Main results
Characteristics of studies and participants  
Eight trials were conducted at multiple sites that included hospital clinics or academic health centres. Seven were single‐centre trials conducted in hospital clinics. Two trials did not report settings. Trials durations ranged from 12 to 52 weeks. Most participants had moderate to severe disease. Mean age ranged from 64 years to 73 years, and more males were recruited (51% to 100%). Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁) ranged from 0.935 to 1.36 L. Most participants had previous exacerbations. Data from 12 studies were included in the NMAs (3405 participants; 16 treatment arms including placebo). Prophylactic antibiotics evaluated were macrolides (azithromycin and erythromycin), tetracyclines (doxycyclines), quinolones (moxifloxacin) and macrolides plus tetracyclines (roxithromycin plus doxycycline). 
Risk of bias and threshold analysis  
Most studies were at low risk across domains, except detection bias, for which only seven studies were judged at low risk. In the threshold analysis for exacerbations, all comparisons in which one antibiotic was compared with another were robust to sampling variation, especially macrolide comparisons. Comparisons of classes with placebo were sensitive to potential bias, especially macrolide versus placebo, therefore, any bias in the comparison was likely to favour the active class, so any adjustment would bring the estimated relative effect closer to the null value, thus quinolone may become the best class to prevent exacerbations. 
Exacerbations  
Nine studies were included (2732 participants) in this NMA (exacerbations analysed as time to first exacerbation or people with one or more exacerbations). Macrolides and quinolones reduced exacerbations. Macrolides had a greater effect in reducing exacerbations compared with placebo (macrolides: hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.60 to 0.75; quinolones: HR 0.89, 95% CrI 0.75 to 1.04), resulting in 127 fewer people per 1000 experiencing exacerbations on macrolides. The difference in exacerbations between tetracyclines and placebo was uncertain (HR 1.29, 95% CrI 0.66 to 2.41). Macrolides ranked first (95% CrI first to second), with quinolones ranked second (95% CrI second to third). Tetracyclines ranked fourth, which was lower than placebo (ranked third). Contributing studies were considered as low risk of bias in a threshold analysis. 
Quality of life (SGRQ)  
Seven studies were included (2237 participants) in this NMA. SGRQ scores improved with macrolide treatment compared with placebo (fixed effect‐fixed class effect: mean difference (MD) ‐2.30, 95% CrI ‐3.61 to ‐0.99), but the mean difference did not reach the minimally clinical important difference (MCID) of 4 points. Tetracyclines and quinolones did not improve quality of life any more than placebo, and we did not detect a difference between antibiotic classes. 
Serious adverse events  
Nine studies were included (3180 participants) in the NMA. Macrolides reduced the odds of a serious adverse event compared with placebo (fixed effect‐fixed class effect: odds ratio (OR) 0.76, 95% CrI 0.62 to 0.93). There was probably little to no difference in the effect of quinolone compared with placebo or tetracycline plus macrolide compared with placebo. There was probably little to no difference in serious adverse events between quinolones or tetracycline plus macrolide. With macrolide treatment 49 fewer people per 1000 experienced a serious adverse event compared with those given placebo. Macrolides ranked first, followed by quinolones. Tetracycline did not rank better than placebo. 
Drug resistance  
Ten studies reported drug resistance. Results were not combined due to variation in outcome measures. All studies concluded that prophylactic antibiotic administration was associated with the development of antimicrobial resistance. 
Authors' conclusions
This NMA evaluated the safety and efficacy of different antibiotics used prophylactically for COPD patients. Compared to placebo, prolonged administration of macrolides (ranked first) appeared beneficial in prolonging the time to next exacerbation, improving quality of life, and reducing serious adverse events. No clear benefits were associated with use of quinolones or tetracyclines. In addition, antibiotic resistance was a concern and could not be thoroughly assessed in this review. Given the trade‐off between effectiveness, safety, and risk of antibiotic resistance, prophylactic administration of antibiotics may be best reserved for selected patients, such as those experiencing frequent exacerbations. However, none of the eligible studies excluded patients with previously isolated non‐tuberculous mycobacteria, which would contraindicate prophylactic administration of antibiotics, due to the risk of developing resistant non‐tuberculous mycobacteria.

Comparing long-term antibiotics to prevent lung flare-ups in people with COPD

### **Rationale**

COPD is a long-term lung disease. COPD stands for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. It makes it hard to breathe. The disease can get worse over time.

People with COPD can have times when their symptoms get much worse. These are called flare-ups. Flare-ups can be very serious. They can make people very sick and may require a hospital stay. Flare-ups also can cause the lung disease to get worse faster.

Doctors think that some germs in the lungs may cause these flare-ups. Taking an antibiotic every day may help kill these germs and reduce swelling. This may lead to fewer flare-ups. This study was done to see if taking antibiotics for a long time can help people with COPD. The researchers wanted to find out which type of antibiotic works best and is the safest.

### **Trial Design**

This was a review study. The researchers did not do a new experiment. Instead, they gathered the results from 12 older studies. This allowed them to compare different antibiotic treatments all at once.

The people in these studies were adults with COPD. Most had moderate to severe lung disease. Their average age was about 65 to 73 years old. Most of the people in the studies were men.

In the original studies, people were put into groups by chance. One group took an antibiotic pill every day. Another group took a dummy pill that looked the same but had no medicine in it. This is called a placebo. The studies lasted for 3 months to 1 year.

### **Results**

The researchers looked at three main things: lung flare-ups, quality of life, and serious side effects.

**Fewer Lung Flare-ups**
The study found that one group of antibiotics, called macrolides, worked best to prevent flare-ups.
• For every 1000 people with COPD who took a macrolide, 127 fewer had a flare-up compared to those who took a dummy pill.
Another group of antibiotics, called quinolones, also seemed to help, but not as much as macrolides. A third group, called tetracyclines, did not seem to prevent flare-ups.

**Quality of Life**
Quality of life is a measure of how people feel about their health and daily life. People who took macrolides said their quality of life was a little better. But the change was small. The other antibiotics did not improve quality of life.

**Serious Side Effects**
The study also looked at serious health problems that happened during the studies. People who took macrolides had fewer serious health problems.
• For every 1000 people who took a macrolide, 49 fewer had a serious health problem compared to those who took a dummy pill.
The other antibiotics did not seem to change the risk of serious side effects.

**Study Conclusions**
The researchers concluded that macrolide antibiotics seem to be the best choice for preventing flare-ups in people with COPD. They also may cause fewer serious side effects.

However, the researchers also had a serious concern. Taking antibiotics for a long time can lead to a problem called antibiotic resistance. This is when germs learn to fight off the antibiotic, so the medicine no longer works.

Because of this risk, the researchers think that long-term antibiotics should not be for everyone with COPD. This treatment may be best only for people who have very frequent flare-ups. Doctors and patients should talk about the benefits and risks before starting this type of treatment.","Prophylactic antibiotics for people with COPD
Review question 
Which preventative antibiotic is effective and safe for reducing exacerbations, improving quality of life, and reducing serious side effects in people with COPD? 
What is COPD? 
COPD is a lung condition that can cause long‐term breathing problems. Symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, and sputum production. Flare‐ups (so‐called exacerbations) can be triggered by infection or inflammation, causing worsening symptoms and lung damage. Frequent exacerbations can lead to reduced quality of life and can increase the risk of death. 
Why did we do this review? 
We wanted to find out if one type of preventative antibiotic was better than another in reducing exacerbations, improving quality of life, and reducing side effects. We did this by using information from two previous reviews and comparing different antibiotics with each other, and with a control treatment (called placebo), by creating networks. As information was limited, the networks allowed us to combine information and determine the best preventative antibiotics by ranking them in order of ability to reduce exacerbations, improve quality of life, and reduce serious side effects. 
What evidence did we find? 
We tested three types of antibiotics: macrolides, quinolones, and tetracyclines. Macrolides were better in reducing exacerbations compared to control treatment. There was no clear difference in exacerbations when quinolone or tetracycline was compared with a control treatment. Tetracyclines were ranked lower than placebo in reducing exacerbations. We used the data for each antibiotic group to rank antibiotic groups in order of their ability to reduce exacerbations. We found that macrolides ranked first, followed by quinolones (second). Tetracyclines were ranked fourth and were not better than control treatment (ranked third). 
Macrolides improved quality of life compared with control treatment. Quinolones did not appear to impact quality of life, and tetracyclines may have been associated with worsening quality of life compared to control treatment. 
Macrolides were more effective in reducing serious unwanted events. There was no clear benefit for serious unwanted events with quinolone, tetracycline, or combined macrolide plus tetracycline compared with control treatment. 
We could not clearly show benefit or harm of preventative antibiotic use for microbial resistance. 
Quality of the evidence 
We did not find any concerns about the ways in which studies were carried out, except that for some studies, people collecting the information knew (1) which patient was included in which treatment group, and (2) patient results when treatments were completed. Overall, the numerical information was robust and was unlikely to be influenced by differences noted between individual studies. 
Conclusion 
We found that exacerbations were reduced, quality of life was improved, and unwanted events were fewer with macrolides compared with control treatment. We could not determine whether quinolones or tetracyclines were of benefit compared with control treatment. Macrolides were ranked highest, followed by quinolones, which ranked second. Tetracyclines were no better than control treatment (ranked fourth and third, respectively). Although these NMAs show some benefit of using macrolides, they are based on a limited number of studies, and concerns remain about antibiotic resistance with long‐term use of antibiotics.

Endotracheal intubation is a commonly performed procedure in neonates, the risks of which are well‐described. Some endotracheal tubes (ETT) are equipped with a cuff that can be inflated after insertion of the ETT in the airway to limit leak or aspiration. Cuffed ETTs have been shown in larger children and adults to reduce gas leak around the ETT, ETT exchange, accidental extubation, and exposure of healthcare workers to anesthetic gas during surgery. With improved understanding of neonatal airway anatomy and the widespread use of cuffed ETTs by anesthesiologists, the use of cuffed tubes is increasing in neonates. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of cuffed ETTs (inflated or non‐inflated) compared to uncuffed ETTs for respiratory support in neonates. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, and CINAHL on 20 August 2021; we also searched trial registers and checked reference lists to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, and cluster‐randomized trials comparing cuffed (inflated and non‐inflated) versus uncuffed ETTs in newborns. We sought to compare 1. inflated, cuffed versus uncuffed ETT; 2. non‐inflated, cuffed versus uncuffed ETT; and 3. inflated, cuffed versus non‐inflated, cuffed ETT. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal. Two review authors independently assessed studies identified by the search strategy for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We identified one eligible RCT for inclusion that compared the use of cuffed (inflated if ETT leak greater than 20% with cuff pressure 20 cm H2O or less) versus uncuffed ETT. The author provided a spreadsheet with individual data. Among 76 infants in the original manuscript, 69 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this Cochrane Review. We found possible bias due to lack of blinding and other bias. 
We are very uncertain about frequency of postextubation stridor, because the confidence intervals (CI) of the risk ratio (RR) were very wide (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.35 to 5.25; risk difference (RD) 0.03, −0.11 to 0.18; 1 study, 69 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
No neonate was diagnosed with postextubation subglottic stenosis; however, endoscopy was not available to confirm the clinical diagnosis. 
We are very uncertain about reintubation for stridor or subglottic stenosis because the CIs of the RR were very wide (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.01 to 6.49; RD −0.03, 95% CI −0.11 to 0.05; 1 study, 69 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
No neonate had surgical intervention (e.g. endoscopic balloon dilation, cricoid split, tracheostomy) for stridor or subglottic stenosis (1 study, 69 participants). 
Neonates randomized to cuffed ETT may be less likely to have a reintubation for any reason (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.45; RD −0.39, 95% CI −0.57 to −0.21; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome 3, 95% CI 2 to 5; 1 study, 69 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
We are very uncertain about accidental extubation because the CIs of the RR were wide (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.12 to 5.46; RD −0.01, 95% CI −0.12 to 0.10; 1 study, 69 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
We are very uncertain about all‐cause mortality during initial hospitalization because the CIs of the RR were extremely wide (RR 2.46, 95% CI 0.10 to 58.39; RD 0.03, 95% CI −0.05 to 0.10; 1 study, 69 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
There is one ongoing trial. We classified two studies as awaiting classification because outcome data were not reported separately for newborns and older infants. 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence for comparing cuffed versus uncuffed ETTs in neonates is limited by a small number of babies in a single RCT with possible bias. There is very low certainty evidence for all outcomes of this review. CIs of the estimate for postextubation stridor were wide. No neonate had clinical evidence for subglottic stenosis; however, endoscopy results were not available to assess the anatomy. 
Additional RCTs are necessary to evaluate the benefits and harms of cuffed ETTs (inflated and non‐inflated) in the neonatal population. These studies must include neonates and be conducted both for short‐term use (in the setting of the operating room) and chronic use (in the setting of chronic lung disease) of cuffed ETTs.

Are Breathing Tubes with Cuffs Safe and Helpful for Newborn Babies?

### **Rationale**

Some newborn babies have trouble breathing on their own. When this happens, they may need a breathing tube to help them. A doctor places a thin tube in the baby’s windpipe to help air get to their lungs.

There are two main types of breathing tubes. One is a simple, smooth tube. The other type has a tiny balloon, called a cuff, near the end. After the tube is in place, a doctor can fill the cuff with a small amount of air. This helps the tube fit snugly in the baby’s airway.

In older children and adults, tubes with cuffs seem to work well. They can stop air from leaking out around the tube. They also may stop the tube from coming out by accident. Doctors are starting to use these cuffed tubes more often in newborn babies.

However, we do not have much information about how well these cuffed tubes work for newborns. We also need to know if they are safe. This study was done to look at all the research available to compare the benefits and harms of tubes with cuffs to tubes without cuffs for newborn babies.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new medical study with patients. Instead, researchers looked for all the best studies that had already been done. This type of research is called a review. They wanted to find studies that directly compared the two types of breathing tubes in newborn babies.

The researchers found only one study that met their rules. This study included 69 newborn babies who needed a breathing tube to help them breathe.

In that study, the babies were put into one of two groups by chance. One group of babies received a breathing tube with a cuff. The other group received a breathing tube without a cuff. The doctors then watched all the babies closely to see if there were any differences between the two groups.

### **Results**

After reviewing the one small study, the researchers found that there is not enough proof to say which type of breathing tube is better for newborns. The results from the study were not clear for most of the important questions. The researchers said that the quality of the information was very low.

*   **Breathing problems after the tube was removed:** Sometimes after a breathing tube is taken out, a baby can have noisy breathing. The study could not tell if one tube type was more or less likely to cause this problem.
*   **Narrowing of the airway:** The researchers looked to see if the tubes caused the baby’s airway to get narrow, which is a serious problem. No babies in the study seemed to have this happen. But doctors did not use a special camera to check for sure.
*   **Needing a new breathing tube:** In one good finding, babies who had the tube with a cuff seemed less likely to need a new tube put in for any reason. For about every 3 babies who received a cuffed tube, 1 baby avoided needing a new tube.
*   **Other problems:** The study could not tell if one tube was better at preventing the tube from falling out by accident. It also could not tell if one tube was safer than the other.

The authors of this review concluded that we still do not know for sure if cuffed tubes are better or safer for newborn babies. The only study they could find was very small and had some possible issues. Because of this, we cannot be sure about the results. More and better research is needed to give doctors and families clear answers.","Cuffed versus uncuffed endotracheal tubes for neonates
Background: newborn babies rarely need a tube placed in the windpipe; however, this may occur before a procedure or to help with breathing. The tube may or may not have a cuff. The standard of care in newborn babies is a tube without a cuff. Cuffed tubes are used more frequently in older babies and children to reduce leaks of gas around the tube, the risk of aspiration (breathing food, saliva, or stomach contents into the airways or lungs), the need to change the tube, or the tube coming out. 
Review question: in this review, we evaluated the evidence for or against using a cuffed tube in newborn babies. 
Study characteristics: we collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer the review question and found one study enrolling 76 babies, of whom 69 met eligibility for this review. This review is up‐to‐date as of 20 August 2021. 
Key results: there is not enough evidence for or against tubes with a cuff to prevent airway problems. Newborn babies who have a tube with a cuff may require less frequent replacement of the tube for any reason and less frequent replacement of the tube to find the correct size than babies who had a tube without a cuff. 
Reliability of the evidence: we judged the reliability of the evidence to be very low. This is because only a few babies were in a single trial and there was possible bias. There is one ongoing trial. We classified two studies as awaiting classification because outcome data were not reported separately for newborns and older infants.

What is the issue? 
Vaginal births are often associated with some form of trauma to the genital tract, and tears that affect the anal sphincter or mucosa (third‐ and fourth‐degree tears) can cause serious problems. Perineal trauma can occur spontaneously or result from a surgical incision (episiotomy). Different perineal techniques are being used to slow down the birth of the baby's head, and allow the perineum to stretch slowly to prevent injury. Massage, warm compresses and different perineal management techniques are widely used by midwives and birth attendants. The objective of this updated review was to assess the effect of perineal techniques during the second stage of labour on the incidence of perineal trauma. This is an update of a review that was published in 2011. 
Why is this important? 
Trauma to the perineum can cause pain and other problems for women after the birth. The damage is described as first‐, second‐, third‐ and fourth‐degree tears – first‐degree tears being the least damage and fourth‐degree tears being the most. Third‐ and fourth‐degree tears, affect the anal sphincter or mucosa, thus causing the most problems. Reducing the use of episiotomies will reduce trauma to the perineum. Also, different perineal techniques are being used to slow down the birth of the baby's head. Massage, warm compresses and different perineal management techniques are widely used by midwives and birth attendants. It is important to know if these do indeed reduce trauma and pain for women. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for studies in September 2016. Twenty two trials were eligible for inclusion in this updated review but only twenty studies (involving 15,181 women), contributed results to the review. The participants in the studies were women without medical complications who were expecting a vaginal birth. The studies varied in their risk of bias, and the quality of the studies was very low to moderate. 
Hands off (or poised) compared to hands on  
Using 'hands off' the perineum resulted in fewer women having an episiotomy (low‐quality evidence), but made no difference to numbers of women with no tears (moderate‐quality evidence), first‐degree tears (low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (low‐quality evidence), or third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence). There were considerable unexplained differences in results between the four studies. None of the studies provided data on the number of tears requiring suturing. 
Warm compresses versus control (hands off or no warm compress)  
Fewer women in the warm‐compress group experienced third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (moderate‐quality evidence). A warm compress did not affect numbers of women with intact perineum (moderate‐quality evidence), tears requiring suturing (very low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), or episiotomies (low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether warm compresses increase or reduce the incidence of first‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence). 
Massage versus control (hands off or routine care)  
There were more women with an intact perineum in the perineal massage group (low‐quality evidence), and fewer women with third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (moderate‐quality evidence). Massage did not appear to make a difference to women with perineal trauma requiring suturing (very low‐quality evidence), first‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), or episiotomies (very low‐quality evidence). 
Ritgen's manoeuvre versus standard care  
One small study found that women who had Ritgen's manoeuvre had fewer first‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), but more second‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence). There was no difference between groups in terms of the number of third‐ or fourth‐degree tears, or episiotomies (both low‐quality evidence). 
What does this mean? 
We found that massage and warm compresses may reduce serious perineal trauma (third‐ and fourth‐degree tears). Hands‐off techniques may reduce the number of episiotomies but it was not clear that these techniques had a beneficial effect on other perineal trauma. There remains uncertainty about the value of other techniques to reduce damage to the perineum during childbirth. 
More research is necessary, to evaluate different perineal techniques and to answer questions about how to minimise perineal trauma. There is insufficient evidence on women's experiences and views (only one included study collected information on this). It is important for future research to ascertain whether these interventions are acceptable to women.

Ways to Prevent Tears in the Skin During Childbirth

### **Rationale**

During a vaginal birth, the skin between the vagina and the anus can stretch and sometimes tear. This area is called the perineum. These tears can be small, or they can be very serious.

Serious tears can damage the muscle that helps you control your bowels. This can cause pain and other problems for a long time after birth. Sometimes, a doctor or midwife makes a small surgical cut in this area to help the baby come out. This cut is called an episiotomy.

Midwives and doctors use different methods to try to prevent tears. They might use a warm cloth on the skin or do a gentle massage. These methods are meant to help the skin stretch slowly as the baby is born. This study looked at past research to see if these methods really work to prevent tears. Finding ways to lower the chance of injury can help women have a better recovery after giving birth.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of many past studies to find an answer. This is called a review.

The researchers found 20 studies to include in their review. In total, these studies included about 15,000 women. All the women in the studies were healthy and were expecting to have a vaginal birth. The study looked at what happened during the second stage of labor, which is the “pushing” stage of childbirth when the baby is born.

### **Results**

The researchers looked at the results for several different methods. Here is what they found:

*   **Using Warm Cloths:** Some women had a warm, wet cloth (a warm compress) placed on their skin during birth. Women who had a warm cloth were less likely to have a serious tear.

*   **Using Massage:** Some women had the skin around the vagina massaged during birth. Women who got a massage were less likely to have a serious tear. More women in this group had no tears at all.

*   **“Hands Off” vs. “Hands On”:** Researchers compared two approaches. In the “hands on” approach, the midwife uses their hands to guide the baby’s head. In the “hands off” approach, the midwife does not touch the area and lets the baby’s head be born slowly. The “hands off” approach led to fewer surgical cuts (episiotomies). But it did not change the number of women who had tears.

*   **Other Methods:** The study looked at other methods too, but the results were not clear.

In conclusion, this review showed that some methods may help protect women from injury during childbirth. Using a warm cloth or massage seems to reduce the most serious types of tears. A “hands off” approach may help avoid the need for a surgical cut.

The researchers believe more studies are needed to be sure about the best ways to prevent tears. It is also important for future research to ask women what methods they are comfortable with.","Perineal techniques during the second stage of labour for reducing perineal trauma

Endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is used to treat aorto‐iliac and isolated iliac aneurysms in selected patients, and prospective studies have shown advantages compared with open surgical repair, mainly in the first years of follow‐up. Although this technique produces good results, anatomic issues (such as common iliac artery ectasia or an aneurysm that involves the iliac bifurcation) can make EVAR more complex and challenging and can lead to an inadequate distal seal zone for the stent‐graft. Inadequate distal fixation in the common iliac arteries can lead to a type Ib endoleak. To avoid this complication, one of the most commonly used techniques is unilateral or bilateral internal iliac artery occlusion and extension of the iliac limb stent‐graft to the external iliac arteries with or without embolisation of the internal iliac artery. However, this occlusion is not without harm and is associated with ischaemic complications in the pelvic territory such as buttock claudication, sexual dysfunction, ischaemic colitis, gluteal necrosis, and spinal cord injury. 
New endovascular devices and alternative techniques such as iliac branch devices and the sandwich technique have been described to maintain pelvic perfusion and decrease complications, achieving revascularisation of the internal iliac arteries in patients not suitable for an adequate seal zone in the common iliac arteries. These approaches may also preserve the quality of life of treated individuals and may decrease other serious complications including spinal cord ischaemia, ischaemic colitis, and gluteal necrosis, thereby decreasing the morbidity and mortality of EVAR. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of internal iliac artery revascularisation versus internal iliac artery occlusion during endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms and isolated iliac aneurysms involving the iliac bifurcation. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialists searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; Embase; the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 28 August 2019. The review authors searched Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) and the Indice Bibliográfico Español de Ciencias de la Salud (IBECS) on 28 August 2019 and contacted specialists in the field and manufacturers to identify relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
We planned to include all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared internal iliac artery revascularisation with internal iliac artery occlusion for patients undergoing endovascular treatment of aorto‐iliac aneurysms and isolated iliac aneurysms involving the iliac bifurcation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed identified studies for potential inclusion in the review. We used standard methodological procedures in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions.

Finding the Best Way to Fix a Bulge in a Major Blood Vessel

### **Rationale**

The aorta is the main blood vessel that carries blood from your heart to the rest of your body. In your belly, it splits into branches that go to your legs and hips. Sometimes, a weak spot can form in the wall of this blood vessel, causing it to bulge out. This bulge is called an aneurysm. An aneurysm is a serious health problem because it could burst, which is very dangerous.

One way to fix an aneurysm is with a surgery that is less invasive than open surgery. In this surgery, doctors place a small tube, called a stent-graft, inside the blood vessel. This tube strengthens the vessel wall and stops the bulge from growing.

But sometimes, it is hard for doctors to get a tight fit for the tube in the blood vessels near the hip. To fix this, doctors may need to block a smaller blood vessel that goes to the hip area. Blocking this blood vessel can cause problems. It may lead to pain in the buttocks when you walk, problems with sex, or other more serious issues from lack of blood flow.

Newer methods have been created to keep this hip blood vessel open during the surgery. This study was done to see which way is better for patients: blocking the hip blood vessel or keeping it open. The researchers wanted to find out which method has fewer side effects and helps people live better after the surgery.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a study that treated new patients. Instead, the researchers looked for studies that had already been done. This is called a review.

The researchers looked for a special type of study called a randomized controlled trial, or RCT. In an RCT, people are put into different groups by chance. This is the best way to compare two treatments to see which one works better and is safer.

The researchers searched for any RCTs that had been completed. They were looking for studies that compared the two ways of doing the aneurysm surgery:
1.  One group of patients had the hip blood vessel blocked.
2.  The other group of patients had the hip blood vessel kept open.

The patients in these studies would have been adults with a bulge in the main blood vessel in their belly or hip. The researchers carefully searched for these studies up to August 2019.

### **Results**

The researchers looked very hard for these studies. After their search, they did not find any randomized controlled trials that matched what they were looking for.

This means that there are no high-quality studies that directly compare blocking the hip blood vessel versus keeping it open during this type of aneurysm repair. Because no studies were found, we do not have strong proof to say which method is better for patients. We do not know for sure which way has fewer side effects.

The people who did this review concluded that new studies are needed. We need good research that compares these two methods side-by-side. This will help doctors and patients make the best choice for treating this health problem in the future. This research would help us learn how to reduce side effects and help people have a better quality of life after their surgery.","Internal iliac artery revascularisation versus internal iliac artery occlusion for endovascular treatment of aorto‐iliac aneurysms 
Background 
An aorto‐iliac aneurysm is a dilatation (aneurysm) of the aorta, the main large blood vessel in the body, which carries blood out from the heart to all organs and iliac arteries (distal branches of the aorta). The aneurysm can grow and burst (rupture), which leads to severe bleeding and is frequently fatal; an estimated 15,000 deaths occur each year from ruptured aortic abdominal aneurysms in the USA alone. To avoid this complication, the aorto‐iliac aneurysm should be repaired when the maximum diameter of the aorta reaches 5 cm to 5.5 cm, or when the maximum diameter of the common iliac arteries reaches 3 cm to 4 cm. 
Endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms is one approach that is used to manage this condition: a tube (stent‐graft) is placed inside the aorto‐iliac aneurysm, so that blood flows through the stent‐graft and no longer into the aneurysm, excluding it from the circulation. To achieve a successful deployment of the stent‐graft, a good seal zone (fixation zone) is needed in the aorta (proximal) and in the common iliac arteries (distal). However, in 40% of patients, the distal seal zone in the common iliac arteries is inadequate. In these cases, most commonly the stent‐graft is extended to the external iliac artery and the internal iliac artery is blocked (occluded). However, this obstruction (occlusion) is not without harms: the internal iliac artery supplies blood to the pelvic organs (rectum, bladder, and reproductive organs) and the pelvic muscles, and occlusion is associated with complications in the pelvic area such as buttock claudication (cramping pain in the buttock during exercise), sexual dysfunction, and spinal cord injury. 
New endovascular devices and techniques such as iliac branch devices have emerged to maintain blood flow into the internal iliac artery. These special stent‐grafts position the distal seal zone within the external iliac artery, and a side branch of the graft allows for revascularisation of the internal iliac artery, while excluding the aneurysm from the circulation, promoting an adequate distal seal zone, and maintaining pelvic circulation. This may also preserve the quality of life of treated individuals and may reduce serious complications including spinal cord ischaemia, ischaemic colitis, and gluteal necrosis. 
This review aimed to assess the effects of internal iliac artery revascularisation compared with internal iliac artery occlusion during endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms. 
Study characteristics and key results 
We searched for evidence that directly compared internal iliac artery revascularisation versus internal iliac artery occlusion for endovascular treatment of aorto‐iliac aneurysms. Our searches up to 28 August 2019 did not identify any randomised controlled trials (clinical studies in which people are randomly (by chance alone) put into one of several intervention groups) that met our criteria. Studies are needed to help vascular and endovascular surgeons choose the best option for endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms and isolated iliac aneurysms with an inadequate distal fixation zone. 
Conclusion 
We found no RCTs that compared internal iliac artery revascularisation versus internal iliac artery occlusion for endovascular treatment of aorto‐iliac aneurysms. High‐quality studies that evaluate the best strategy for managing the endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms with inadequate distal seal zones in the common iliac artery are needed.

Background  Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynaecological cancers. Standard therapy consists of surgery and chemotherapy. Responses to chemotherapy are generally good; however, most women experience relapse, for which no curative treatment is available.

This suggests that stimulation of anti‐tumour immune responses (i.e. immunotherapy) might be a useful approach for improving outcomes among women with ovarian cancer. 
Review question This review evaluated the feasibility of antigen‐specific active immunotherapy. Antigen‐specific active immunotherapy aims to induce anti‐tumour immune responses through administration of a tumour antigen ‐ a molecule that is expressed by tumour cells and is hardly expressed by healthy cells. Reviewers collected information on clinical outcomes, immunological responses, and side effects. 
Main findings We identified 67 studies, which included 3632 women with ovarian cancer and were published between 1966 and 2017. The most frequently described strategy was administration of antibodies targeting the tumour antigen CA‐125 (2347 participants in 17 studies). Most of these studies primarily evaluated safety and immunological responses. Severe flu‐like and gastrointestinal symptoms occurred in 7% to 30% of participants. Researchers frequently detected antibodies and immune cells recognising the tumour antigen CA‐125, albeit response rates varied between studies. Despite these promising immunological responses, four large studies reported no survival advantage for participants treated with CA‐125‐directed antibody over those given placebo. 
For strategies not relying on antibody administration, similar conclusions cannot yet be drawn. Overall, study authors report that treatment was well tolerated and inflammatory side effects at the injection site were most frequently observed. Researchers observed responses of the immune system for most strategies studied, but the clinical benefit of these strategies remains to be evaluated in large trials.

Looking at Studies on a Treatment That Teaches the Body to Fight Ovarian Cancer

### **Rationale**

**What is ovarian cancer?**

Ovarian cancer is a serious illness for women. Standard treatments include surgery to remove the cancer and strong medicines, called chemotherapy, to kill cancer cells. These treatments often work well at first.

**Why is new research needed?**

For most women, the cancer comes back after some time. When the cancer returns, there are no treatments that can cure it. This is why doctors are looking for new ways to treat ovarian cancer.

Doctors noticed that when a person's own defense system is active against the cancer, they often live longer. The body's defense system is called the immune system. It helps protect you from germs and illness. This led to an idea: what if we could help the immune system fight cancer? This type of treatment is called immunotherapy.

**What was this study about?**

This research looked at a special kind of immunotherapy. It tries to teach your immune system to find and attack cancer cells. It does this by using a special marker, like a flag, that is on cancer cells but not on most healthy cells. This flag is called a tumor antigen. The hope was that this treatment could help the body fight the cancer and help women live longer.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a single study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of many past studies all at once. This is called a review. A review helps doctors see what all the research so far tells us about a treatment.

The researchers found 67 different studies to review. These studies took place between the years 1966 and 2017. In total, the studies included 3,632 women who had ovarian cancer. By looking at all these studies together, the researchers hoped to get a clear picture of whether this type of immunotherapy works and if it is safe.

### **Results**

**What did the researchers find?**

The review showed that the most common treatment studied used a special protein called an antibody. The antibody was designed to find a cancer flag called CA-125. The studies found that this treatment did seem to turn on the body's immune system. This was a hopeful sign.

However, turning on the immune system did not help women live longer. Four large studies showed that women who got the treatment did not live any longer than women who got a fake treatment, called a placebo. A placebo is like a sugar pill and has no medicine in it.

**Did the treatment have side effects?**

Yes. For the treatment that targeted the CA-125 flag, about 1 to 3 out of every 10 women had bad flu-like feelings and stomach problems.

The review also looked at other, less common types of immune treatments. For these, the main side effects were redness or soreness where the shot was given. These treatments also seemed to turn on the immune system. But the studies were too small to know if they helped women live longer.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

The researchers who did this big review reached a clear conclusion. The antibody treatment that targets the CA-125 cancer flag should not be used as a standard treatment for ovarian cancer right now. It does not help women live longer and it can cause side effects.

For the other types of immune treatments, we need more and bigger studies to know if they can help. Researchers need to agree on the best ways to do these studies so the results can be compared more easily. New studies are happening now, and more are needed to find better ways to help women with ovarian cancer.","Antigen‐specific active immunotherapy for ovarian cancer

Hospital‐acquired pneumonia is one of the most common hospital‐acquired infections in children worldwide. Most of our understanding of hospital‐acquired pneumonia in children is derived from adult studies. To our knowledge, no systematic review with meta‐analysis has assessed the benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens in neonates and children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia. 
Objectives
To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of different antibiotic regimens for hospital‐acquired pneumonia in neonates and children. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two trial registers to February 2021, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised clinical trials comparing one antibiotic regimen with any other antibiotic regimen for hospital‐acquired pneumonia in neonates and children. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Our primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality and serious adverse events; our secondary outcomes were health‐related quality of life, pneumonia‐related mortality, non‐serious adverse events, and treatment failure. Our primary time point of interest was at maximum follow‐up. 
Main results
We included four randomised clinical trials (84 participants). We assessed all trials as having high risk of bias. 
We did not conduct any meta‐analyses, as the included trials did not compare similar antibiotic regimens. 
Each of the four trials assessed a different comparison, as follows: cefepime versus ceftazidime; linezolid versus vancomycin; meropenem versus cefotaxime; and ceftobiprole versus cephalosporin. 
Only one trial reported our primary outcomes of all‐cause mortality and serious adverse events. Three trials reported our secondary outcome of treatment failure. Two trials primarily included community‐acquired pneumonia and hospitalised children with bacterial infections, hence the children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia constituted subgroups of the total sample sizes. 
Where outcomes were reported, the certainty of the evidence was very low for each of the comparisons. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. 
None of the included trials assessed health‐related quality of life, pneumonia‐related mortality, or non‐serious adverse events. 
Authors' conclusions
The relative beneficial and harmful effects of different antibiotic regimens remain unclear due to the very low certainty of the available evidence. The current evidence is insufficient to support any antibiotic regimen being superior to another. Randomised clinical trials assessing different antibiotic regimens for hospital‐acquired pneumonia in children and neonates are warranted.

Looking for the Best Medicine for Lung Infections Children Get in the Hospital

**Rationale**

A lung infection is also called pneumonia. Sometimes, children get pneumonia while they are in the hospital. This is called hospital-acquired pneumonia. This type of lung infection is common. It can be a serious problem for babies and children.

Doctors use special medicines called antibiotics to treat these infections. Antibiotics are drugs that kill germs called bacteria. But doctors do not know which antibiotic is the best and safest one to use for children. Most of the information we have about these medicines comes from studies with adults. Children's bodies are different from adults' bodies. They may need different treatments.

We did this study to find out what is already known. We wanted to look at all the past research. Our goal was to compare different antibiotics. We wanted to see if one was better or safer than others for treating lung infections in babies and children. This work is important to help doctors make the best choices for their young patients.

**Trial Design**

This was not a study where we gave medicine to children. Instead, we did a review of other studies. This means we looked for all the studies that had already been done on this topic. We carefully searched for studies up to February 2021.

We looked for a special type of study called a randomized clinical trial. In these studies, people are chosen by chance to get one treatment or another. This is the best way to compare treatments fairly.

The studies we looked for had to include newborn babies and children. These young patients all had a lung infection that they got while in the hospital. Our team of three researchers read the studies to decide which ones to include. Then, we collected the information from those studies.

**Results**

We found only four studies to include in our review. In total, these four studies included 84 children. We found that all four studies had a high risk of problems in how they were done. This means we cannot be very sure about their results.

Each of the four studies compared a different pair of antibiotic medicines. Because the studies all looked at different medicines, we could not combine their results. Combining results can often give us a stronger answer, but we could not do that here.

We wanted to find out about serious things, like how many children got better or had bad side effects. But the studies gave very little information on this. Only one study talked about deaths or serious side effects. None of the studies looked at how the children felt after their treatment.

Because of the small number of studies and the limited information, we cannot make clear conclusions. There is not enough good proof to say if one antibiotic is better than another. We learned that more and better research is needed. Doctors and families need this information to choose the best treatment for children with this type of lung infection.","Antibiotics for hospital‐acquired pneumonia in newborns and children
Review question 
Which antibiotic regimen is safer and more effective in treating neonates (newborns) and children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia? 
Background 
Hospital‐acquired pneumonia is an inflammation of the tissue of one or both lungs caused by an infection that occurs during a hospital stay (i.e. 48 hours or more after hospital admission). It is one of the most common hospital‐acquired infections in children worldwide, and is associated with a high death rate. Most of our understanding of hospital‐acquired pneumonia in children is drawn from adult studies. To our knowledge this is the first review with meta‐analysis that assesses the benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens in newborns and children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to February 2021.
Study characteristics 
We included four trials randomising 84 children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia to different antibiotic regimens. Three trials were multicentre trials from the USA, Latin America, Europe, and South Africa. The South African trial included one site in Malaysia. Each of the four included trials compared different antibiotic regimens, as follows: cefepime versus ceftazidime; linezolid versus vancomycin; meropenem versus cefotaxime; and ceftobiprole versus cephalosporin. 
Study funding sources 
Three trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies (Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Pharmacia Corp, and Basilea Pharmaceutica International Ltd.), indicating a possible risk of bias related to a vested interest risk. 
Key results 
Each of the four included trials compared different antibiotic regimens, as follows: cefepime versus ceftazidime; linezolid versus vancomycin; meropenem versus cefotaxime; and ceftobiprole versus cephalosporin. 
Only one trial reported our primary outcomes of death from all causes and serious adverse events (major complications). Three trials reported our secondary outcome of treatment failure. Two trials primarily included community‐acquired pneumonia and hospitalised children with bacterial infections, hence the children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia constituted only subgroups of the total study populations. 
Where outcomes were reported, the certainty of the evidence was very low for each of the comparisons. We were unable to draw any meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. 
None of the included trials assessed health‐related quality of life, pneumonia‐related death, or non‐serious adverse events (minor complications). 
Conclusions 
The available evidence does not suggest that one antibiotic regimen is safer and more effective than another in treating newborns and children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia. Further research is needed. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of evidence is very low. All four included trials had high risk of bias (i.e. the studies were designed in such a way that the results may have been skewed). In addition, the included trials involved few participants, which is likely to have led to inaccurate results.

Asthma is a common chronic respiratory disease. People with asthma have inflammation of their airways that causes recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness and chest tightness, with or without a cough. Statins possess multiple therapeutic effects, including lowering lipid levels in the blood. Statins are reported to have a potential role as an adjunct treatment in asthma. However, comprehensive evidence of the benefits and harms of using statins is required to facilitate decision making. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of statins as an adjunct therapy for asthma in adults and children. 
Search methods
We searched for studies in the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid SP and Embase Ovid SP, from their inception dates We handsearched the proceedings of major respiratory conferences. We also searched clinical trials registries for completed, ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews to identify additional studies. 
The search is current to 7 February 2020.
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a parallel‐group design that assessed statins for at least 12 weeks' duration. We considered all participants with a clinical diagnosis of asthma to be eligible, regardless of age, sex, disease severity and previous or current treatment. We planned to include studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only, and unpublished data. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened and selected the studies, extracted outcome data and intervention characteristics from included studies, and assessed risk of bias according to standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We resolved any disagreement through discussion. 
Main results
We found only one trial involving a total of 60 people living with asthma. The trial compared the effect of atorvastatin with a placebo (dummy treatment containing lactose) in treating people with chronic asthma. The trial did not report data for the primary outcomes or adverse events. There was uncertainty about the relative effect on forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) in the atorvastatin group compared with the placebo group. The study did not report serious adverse effects for the interventions. The included study had internal discrepancies in its reported data. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence was of very low certainty, so we are unable to draw conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of statins to treat asthma. High‐quality RCTs are needed to assess the effect of statins on people with asthma. Well‐designed multicentre trials with larger samples and longer duration of treatment are required, which assess outcomes such as adverse events, hospital utilisation and costs, to provide better quality evidence. Future studies that include subgroups of obese people with asthma are also required.

### **Plain Title**

Are Cholesterol Drugs (Statins) a Safe and Helpful Add-on Treatment for Asthma?

### **Rationale**

Asthma is a long-term health problem that affects the lungs. If you have asthma, the small tubes that carry air in your lungs can swell up. This swelling is called inflammation. It can make it hard to breathe.

When your asthma is active, you might wheeze, cough, or feel a tightness in your chest. This can make daily life hard. Finding good treatments is important to help people manage their asthma and feel better.

Statins are a type of drug that many people take to lower cholesterol. Cholesterol is a type of fat in the blood. Some doctors think statins might also help reduce the swelling in the lungs. If this is true, statins could be a helpful add-on treatment for asthma.

But we do not have enough proof to know for sure. Researchers did this study to see if using statins is truly helpful and safe for people with asthma. They wanted to look at all the research that has been done to find a clear answer.

### **Trial Design**

This was a review study. This means the researchers did not work with patients. Instead, they searched for all the studies that had already been done on this topic. They planned to bring all the results together to get a better understanding.

The researchers looked for a special kind of study called a randomized controlled trial. In these studies, people are put into groups by chance. This is the fairest way to test if a treatment works.

One group would get a statin drug. The other group would get a placebo. A placebo is a dummy pill, like a sugar pill, that has no medicine in it. Comparing these two groups helps show if the real medicine made a difference.

The researchers looked for studies that included adults or children with asthma. The studies needed to last for at least 3 months. The researchers searched for all studies that were finished up to February 2020.

### **Results**

The researchers looked very hard for studies that fit their plan. After a wide search, they found only one small study. This study included 60 people who had long-term asthma.

This one study compared a statin drug called atorvastatin to a placebo. A placebo is a fake pill that looks like the real drug but has no medicine in it. In this study, the placebo pill was made of lactose.

Sadly, the study did not share information about the most important things the researchers wanted to know. It did not report if the statin helped control asthma symptoms. It also did not report if people had any bad side effects from the drug.

The study did share some results from breathing tests, but the information was not clear. It was hard to tell if the statin helped people breathe better than the placebo did. Because there was only one small study with unclear results, the proof is very weak.

The researchers concluded that we still do not know if statins are a safe or helpful treatment for asthma. Based on the evidence we have now, we cannot say if doctors should use them for this reason.

More and better research is needed. Future studies should be much larger and include more people. They should also last for a longer time. These new studies must track all side effects and see if the treatment helps keep people out of the hospital. This is the only way to get a clear answer.","Statins for asthma
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of statins in people with asthma.
Background 
Asthma is a common chronic (persistent) airway disease. Asthma is caused by inflammation in the lungs and bronchoconstriction (tightening of the small tubes in the lungs in response to a trigger such as pollen or cold air). Inflammation and bronchoconstriction cause airflow obstruction (narrowing and blockage). People with asthma experience recurrent attacks of wheezing, difficultly in breathing, and chest tightness, with or without a cough. 
Statins are anti‐inflammatory medicines. We wanted to review the evidence for statins because the theory is that their anti‐inflammatory properties will help people with asthma. We wanted to discover whether using statin therapy was better or worse than other alternatives, such as usual care alone or different types of statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin). 
Study characteristics 
We found only one trial that assessed atorvastatin (a type of statin drug) and placebo (dummy treatment) in 60 adults with asthma over a period of 12 weeks. These people had chronic asthma (persistent airway disease) when they started treatment. 
Key results 
We found that the statin (atorvastatin) did not result in any clear improvement in lung function in people with asthma, but may be better in asthma control than the dummy drug. However, because there is only one trial, we cannot draw firm conclusions. 
The trial did not report on adverse effects or severe adverse effects (harms). We are uncertain whether statins may  have beneficial effects on relieving asthma or whether they may increase the risk of adverse events or non‐serious adverse events. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of very low certainty, so we cannot draw firm conclusions about whether statins are helpful and safe to be used by people with asthma. 
The evidence is current to 7 February 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD014877.pub2,"Rapid molecular tests for tuberculosis and tuberculosis drug resistance: the views and experiences of people who are tested and healthcare providers 
What is the aim of this review? 
We aimed to understand the experiences and opinions of people using rapid automated tests that identify tuberculosis and resistance to tuberculosis drugs (molecular diagnostic tests). Users include people who might have tuberculosis and their families or caregivers, doctors, nurses, laboratory staff, and managers of services or programmes. 
What was studied in this review?  
Rapid molecular diagnostic tests were designed to make diagnosis easier and faster for people with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis, because they do not require a well‐equipped laboratory, but can be done in clinics closer to where people live. Since these tests can also suggest whether an individual suffers from drug‐resistant tuberculosis (including multidrug‐resistant tuberculosis (MDR‐TB)), the right treatment can be started earlier. We collected and analysed all relevant studies and found 32 studies conducted in areas where tuberculosis is common in low‐ and middle‐income countries. 
MDR‐TB is tuberculosis caused by resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid, the two most effective first‐line drugs used to treat tuberculosis.  
This qualitative evidence synthesis links to another Cochrane Review that examines the diagnostic accuracy of a rapid molecular test for tuberculosis drug resistance. Yet, diagnostic tests only have an impact on health if they are put to use in a correct and timely manner. Accuracy studies do not reveal what users think of or how they experience the test in question. We need to understand the perspectives and experiences of all users. Otherwise, we risk these tests not fitting settings where they are to be used or not being accessible for those in need. 
What are the main findings? 
People with tuberculosis value knowing what is wrong with them. People valued having an accurate diagnosis, avoiding delays in being diagnosed, having accessible testing facilities, and keeping cost low. Similarly, healthcare providers value having accurate tests that give them confidence in the diagnosis, rapid results, and keeping cost low, being able to use different specimens (such as sputum and stool)  and receiving information about drug resistance as part of the test results. Laboratory personnel appreciated that laboratory work was made easier and that staff was more satisfied thanks to rapid molecular diagnostic tests. 
Our review also identified several challenges to realizing these values. Some people with tuberculosis and some healthcare providers were reluctant to use rapid molecular diagnostic tests because of fears of testing positive, concerns of stigma or discredit in the community, or expenses related to the testing. Additional support is required to overcome these barriers that are common to other approaches to testing for tuberculosis. Other challenges that led to delays and underuse of rapid molecular diagnostic tests were health system inefficiencies; poor quality of specimens; difficulty in transporting specimens; lack of sufficient resources such as staff or equipment; increased workload for providers; inefficiencies in integrating the test into routines at clinics; the complicated or lengthy steps involved in obtaining a tuberculosis diagnosis; clinicians relying too much on the test result while neglecting their own experience with diagnosing tuberculosis; and processes of implementing the test in national programmes that lacked data about real‐life situations and did not include all relevant stakeholders such as local decision‐makers, providers or people seeking a diagnosis. 
Lastly, people expressed concerns about unsustainable funding, maintenance requirements of the tests, lengthy delays in diagnosis, underuse of rapid molecular diagnostic tests, lack of tuberculosis diagnostic facilities in local communities, conflicts of interest between donors and people who utilize the tests, and too many restrictions on who was allowed to access the test. These concerns hampered access to prompt and accurate testing and treatment. This was particularly the case for vulnerable people, such as children, people with MDR‐TB, or those with limited ability to pay. 
Overall, these challenges risk undoing the added value of rapid molecular diagnostic tests. They risk leading to less frequent use of these tests. Implementation of new diagnostic tests, like those considered in this review, will need to tackle the challenges identified in this review including weak infrastructure and systems, as well as insufficient data about real‐life situations before and during implementation in order to ensure the tests are accessible for those in need. 
How up to date is this review? 
We included studies published between 1 January 2007 and 20 October 2021. We limited all searches to 2007 onward because the development of Xpert MTB/RIF, the first rapid molecular diagnostic test in this review, was completed in 2009.

What People Think About New, Fast Tests for Tuberculosis

### **Rationale**

Tuberculosis, or TB, is a serious illness caused by a germ. For many years, doctors have used medicines to treat TB. But sometimes, the germs that cause TB are very strong. The usual medicines do not work against them. This is called drug-resistant TB.

New, fast tests can help find TB sooner. These tests can also tell if a person has drug-resistant TB. This helps doctors choose the right medicine from the start.

This review was done to understand what people think about these new, fast tests. We wanted to hear from people who might have TB and their doctors. It is important to know their views. If people do not like or trust a test, they may not use it. We need to make sure these helpful tests are used in the right way.

### **Trial Design**

This was a review study. This means we did not do new tests on people. Instead, we looked at studies that were already done. We found and read 32 studies about these new TB tests.

These studies took place in countries where TB is common. They gathered the thoughts and experiences of many different people. This included people who were tested for TB and their families. It also included doctors, nurses, lab workers, and health managers. We looked at studies that were done between the years 2007 and 2021.

### **Results**

**What People Liked About the Tests**

People with TB were glad to get a clear and fast answer about their illness. They liked that the tests were correct. They also liked when testing places were close to home and did not cost a lot of money.

Doctors and nurses also liked the new tests. They felt sure about the results. The fast results helped them start the right treatment sooner. Lab workers said the new tests made their jobs easier and more satisfying.

**What the Problems Were**

The review also found many problems. Some people were afraid to take the test. They worried about finding out they had TB. They also worried that people in their town would treat them badly.

Health centers also had problems that caused delays.
*   Sometimes there were not enough staff or tools.
*   It was hard to get samples, like spit, to the lab.
*   The steps to get a test were often long and hard.
*   Some doctors relied only on the test result. They did not always use their own knowledge.

There were also concerns about the future. People worried about who would pay for the tests. They worried the machines would break down. They also felt that not everyone who needed a test could get one. This was a big problem for children and people with drug-resistant TB.

**What We Learned**

The new, fast tests for TB are very helpful. But they can only work well if we fix these other problems. The problems in our health systems can undo the good things about the tests.

To make sure these tests help everyone, health leaders must plan better. They need to make health centers stronger. They must make it easy and fair for all people who need a test to get one. This will help us fight TB and save more lives.","Rapid molecular tests for tuberculosis and tuberculosis drug resistance: the views and experiences of people who are tested and healthcare providers

Ocrelizumab is a humanised anti‐CD20 monoclonal antibody developed for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2017 for using in adults with relapsing‐remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). Ocrelizumab is the only disease‐modifying therapy (DMT) approved for PPMS. In November 2017, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) also approved ocrelizumab as the first drug for people with early PPMS. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the benefits, harms, and tolerability of ocrelizumab in people with MS. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits, harms, and tolerability of ocrelizumab in people with RRMS and PPMS. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and two trials registers on 8 October 2021. We screened reference lists, contacted experts, and contacted the main authors of studies. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults diagnosed with RRMS or PPMS according to the McDonald criteria, comparing ocrelizumab alone or associated with other medications, at the approved dose of 600 mg every 24 weeks for any duration, versus placebo or any other active drug therapy. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
Four RCTs met our selection criteria. The overall population included 2551 participants; 1370 treated with ocrelizumab 600 mg and 1181 controls. Among the controls, 298 participants received placebo and 883 received interferon beta‐1a. The treatment duration was 24 weeks in one study, 96 weeks in two studies, and at least 120 weeks in one study. One study was at high risk of allocation concealment and blinding of participants and personnel; all four studies were at high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data. 
For RRMS, compared with interferon beta‐1a, ocrelizumab was associated with: 1. lower relapse rate (risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 0.73; 2 studies, 1656 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); 2. a lower number of participants with disability progression (hazard ratio (HR) 0.60, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.84; 2 studies, 1656 participants; low‐certainty evidence); 3. little to no difference in the number of participants with any adverse event (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.04; 2 studies, 1651 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); 4. little to no difference in the number of participants with any serious adverse event (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.11; 2 studies, 1651 participants; low‐certainty evidence); 5. a lower number of participants experiencing treatment discontinuation caused by adverse events (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.91; 2 studies, 1651 participants; low‐certainty evidence); 6. a lower number of participants with gadolinium‐enhancing T1 lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.35; 2 studies, 1656 participants; low‐certainty evidence); 7. a lower number of participants with new or enlarging T2‐hyperintense lesions on MRI (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.69; 2 studies, 1656 participants; low‐certainty evidence) at 96 weeks. 
For PPMS, compared with placebo, ocrelizumab was associated with: 1. a lower number of participants with disability progression (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.98; 1 study, 731 participants; low‐certainty evidence); 2. a higher number of participants with any adverse events (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.11; 1 study, 725 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); 3. little to no difference in the number of participants with any serious adverse event (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.23; 1 study, 725 participants; low‐certainty evidence); 4. little to no difference in the number of participants experiencing treatment discontinuation caused by adverse events (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.75; 1 study, 725 participants; low‐certainty evidence) for at least 120 weeks. There were no data for number of participants with gadolinium‐enhancing T1 lesions on MRI and number of participants with new or enlarging T2‐hyperintense lesions on MRI. 
Authors' conclusions
For people with RRMS, ocrelizumab probably results in a large reduction in relapse rate and little to no difference in adverse events when compared with interferon beta‐1a at 96 weeks (moderate‐certainty evidence). Ocrelizumab may result in a large reduction in disability progression, treatment discontinuation caused by adverse events, number of participants with gadolinium‐enhancing T1 lesions on MRI, and number of participants with new or enlarging T2‐hyperintense lesions on MRI, and may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events (low‐certainty evidence). 
For people with PPMS, ocrelizumab probably results in a higher rate of adverse events when compared with placebo for at least 120 weeks (moderate‐certainty evidence). Ocrelizumab may result in a reduction in disability progression and little to no difference in serious adverse events and treatment discontinuation caused by adverse events (low‐certainty evidence). 
Ocrelizumab was well tolerated clinically; the most common adverse events were infusion‐related reactions and nasopharyngitis, and urinary tract and upper respiratory tract infections.

How Well Does the Drug Ocrelizumab Work for People with Multiple Sclerosis?

### **Rationale**

**What is multiple sclerosis?**

Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is a long-term illness. It affects the brain and spinal cord. MS can cause problems with vision, balance, and how you move your muscles.

There are different types of MS. One type is relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). In this type, symptoms can get worse for a while and then get better. This is called a relapse or a flare-up. Another type is primary progressive MS (PPMS). In this type, symptoms slowly get worse over time without getting better.

**Why was this study done?**

A medicine called ocrelizumab can treat MS. It works by targeting certain cells in the body’s defense system. These cells can harm the brain and spinal cord in people with MS.

Ocrelizumab is an important treatment option. It is the only medicine approved to treat PPMS. Researchers wanted to know more about how well this medicine works. They also wanted to know if it is safe. This study looked at past research to find out the benefits and harms of ocrelizumab for people with RRMS and PPMS.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of four past studies. These studies were designed to be fair tests. In these studies, people were put into groups by chance to compare treatments. This is the best way to see if a medicine really works.

**Who was in the studies?**

A total of 2,551 adults with either RRMS or PPMS were in the four studies.

**What did the study groups do?**

Some people in the studies were given the drug ocrelizumab. Others were given a different MS drug called interferon beta-1a. Some people were given a placebo. A placebo is a treatment with no real medicine in it, like a sugar pill. This helps researchers see if the real drug is better than no treatment. The studies lasted from about six months to over two years.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The results were different for the two types of MS.

**For people with the “come and go” type of MS (RRMS):**

Researchers compared ocrelizumab to the other MS drug, interferon beta-1a. They found that people who took ocrelizumab:

*   Had fewer flare-ups.
*   Were less likely to have their MS symptoms get worse over time.
*   Had fewer signs of MS activity on their brain scans.
*   Were less likely to stop treatment because of side effects.

The total number of side effects was about the same for both drugs. The number of serious side effects was also about the same.

**For people with the “slowly worse” type of MS (PPMS):**

Researchers compared ocrelizumab to a placebo (the fake treatment). They found that people who took ocrelizumab:

*   Were less likely to have their MS symptoms get worse over time.
*   Had slightly more side effects than those who took the placebo.

However, there was no real difference in the number of serious side effects. People in both groups were just as likely to stop treatment because of side effects.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

For people with RRMS, ocrelizumab seems to work well. It likely causes fewer flare-ups than the other drug it was compared to. It may also help slow down how fast the illness gets worse.

For people with PPMS, ocrelizumab may help slow down the illness. It may cause more minor side effects than a placebo. But it does not seem to cause more serious side effects.

Overall, people seemed to handle the drug well. The most common side effects were reactions when the drug was given through a needle, a stuffy or runny nose, and common infections of the throat or urinary tract.","What are the benefits and risks of ocrelizumab for multiple sclerosis?
Key messages 
– Ocrelizumab is a recently approved medicine to treat people with multiple sclerosis (MS). In relapsing‐remitting MS (where people experience flare‐ups of symptoms), ocrelizumab probably substantially reduces flare‐ups, may substantially reduce worsening of symptoms, and probably makes little or no difference to unwanted effects compared with interferon beta‐1a (a standard treatment for MS), 96 weeks after treatment starts. 
– Compared to placebo (a dummy medicine) after 120 weeks of treatment for primary progressive MS (where people's symptoms worsen gradually), ocrelizumab may reduce worsening of symptoms. Ocrelizumab probably increases unwanted effects but makes little or no difference to the number of serious unwanted effects. 
– We need more, better‐designed studies to test the effectiveness of ocrelizumab and measure unwanted effects.  
What is multiple sclerosis? 
MS is a condition where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the nerves in the brain and spinal cord (the central nervous system). This damage prevents messages travelling from the central nervous system to other parts of the body. It causes a range of potential symptoms from pins and needles to difficulties with balance and walking.  
There are several types of MS. In relapsing‐remitting MS, people have 'flare‐ups' of disease followed by periods of recovery. In primary progressive MS, people's symptoms gradually worsen over time.  
What is ocrelizumab? 
Ocrelizumab is a medicine that has been recently approved to treat relapsing‐remitting MS and primary progressive MS. It is a disease‐modifying therapy, which is a type of medicine that treats the underlying symptoms of MS. Ocrelizumab targets white blood cells in the body's immune system. It sticks to a type of these cells called B cells, and stops them attacking the central nervous system. This prevents inflammation and nerve damage, reducing the number and severity of relapses and slowing the worsening of symptoms. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if ocrelizumab is more effective than any other medicine or placebo in people with relapsing‐remitting MS and primary progressive MS. 
We were interested in how many people:
– had symptom flare‐ups;
– had worsening symptoms;
– experienced unwanted effects; and
– stopped treatment due to unwanted effects.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared ocrelizumab against any other medicine or placebo for people with a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing‐remitting MS or primary progressive MS. People in the studies could be any age or sex, could have mild or severe symptoms, and could have had MS for any length of time. 
We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found four studies with 2551 people with MS. The largest study included 732 people and the smallest included 163 people. The studies were in countries around the world, but mostly in the USA. One study lasted for 24 weeks; two studies for 96 weeks; and one study for at least 120 weeks. Pharmaceutical companies funded the four studies. 
Three studies compared ocrelizumab with interferon beta‐1a in people with relapsing‐remitting MS. Interferon beta‐1a is an older type of disease‐modifying therapy. One study compared ocrelizumab with placebo for people with primary progressive MS. 
Main results 
Ocrelizumab compared with interferon beta‐1a for people with relapsing‐remitting MS, after 96 weeks of treatment: 
– probably substantially reduces the number of people who had flare‐ups;
– may substantially reduce the number of people whose symptoms got worse;
– probably makes little or no difference to unwanted effects; and 
– may substantially reduce the number of people who stopped having treatment due to unwanted effects.  
Ocrelizumab compared with placebo for people with primary progressive MS, after 120 weeks of treatment: 
– may reduce the number of people whose symptoms got worse; 
– probably increases unwanted effects;  and
– may make little or no difference to the number of serious unwanted effects and the number of people who stopped having treatment due to unwanted effects. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the results is moderate to low for several reasons. First, people dropped out of the studies unevenly, which meant more people had one treatment than the other. Second, there was not enough information about some of our points of interest to allow us to draw conclusions for outcomes, there was not enough information available for us to be confident in the results. Finally, changes in symptoms shown by scans could have been due to causes other than disease progression. 
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to 8 October 2021.

The prevalence of non‐alcohol‐related fatty liver disease (NAFLD) varies between 19% and 33% in different populations. NAFLD decreases life expectancy and increases risks of liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the requirement for liver transplantation. Uncertainty surrounds relative benefits and harms of various nutritional supplements in NAFLD. Currently no nutritional supplement is recommended for people with NAFLD. 
Objectives
• To assess the benefits and harms of different nutritional supplements for treatment of NAFLD through a network meta‐analysis• To generate rankings of different nutritional supplements according to their safety and efficacy 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until February 2021 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with NAFLD. 
Selection criteria
We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) for people with NAFLD, irrespective of method of diagnosis, age and diabetic status of participants, or presence of non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation. 
Data collection and analysis
We performed a network meta‐analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods whenever possible and calculated differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HRs), odds ratios (ORs), and rate ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) based on an available‐case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. 
Main results
We included in the review a total of 202 randomised clinical trials (14,200 participants). Nineteen trials were at low risk of bias. A total of 32 different interventions were compared in these trials. A total of 115 trials (7732 participants) were included in one or more comparisons. The remaining trials did not report any of the outcomes of interest for this review. 
Follow‐up ranged from 1 month to 28 months. The follow‐up period in trials that reported clinical outcomes was 2 months to 28 months. During this follow‐up period, clinical events related to NAFLD such as mortality, liver cirrhosis, liver decompensation, liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver‐related mortality were sparse. 
We did not calculate effect estimates for mortality because of sparse data (zero events for at least one of the groups in the trial). None of the trials reported that they measured overall health‐related quality of life using a validated scale. The evidence is very uncertain about effects of interventions on serious adverse events (number of people or number of events). 
We are very uncertain about effects on adverse events of most of the supplements that we investigated, as the evidence is of very low certainty. However, people taking PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acid) may be more likely to experience an adverse event than those not receiving an active intervention (network meta‐analysis results: OR 4.44, 95% CrI 2.40 to 8.48; low‐certainty evidence; 4 trials, 203 participants; direct evidence: OR 4.43, 95% CrI 2.43 to 8.42). People who take other supplements (a category that includes nutritional supplements other than vitamins, fatty acids, phospholipids, and antioxidants) had higher numbers of adverse events than those not receiving an active intervention (network meta‐analysis: rate ratio 1.73, 95% CrI 1.26 to 2.41; 6 trials, 291 participants; direct evidence: rate ratio 1.72, 95% CrI 1.25 to 2.40; low‐certainty evidence). 
Data were sparse (zero events in all groups in the trial) for liver transplantation, liver decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. So, we did not perform formal analysis for these outcomes. The evidence is very uncertain about effects of other antioxidants (antioxidants other than vitamins) compared to no active intervention on liver cirrhosis (HR 1.68, 95% CrI 0.23 to 15.10; 1 trial, 99 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
The evidence is very uncertain about effects of interventions in any of the remaining comparisons, or data were sparse (with zero events in at least one of the groups), precluding formal calculations of effect estimates. 
Data were probably because of the very short follow‐up period (2 months to 28 months). It takes follow‐up of 8 to 28 years to detect differences in mortality between people with NAFLD and the general population. Therefore, it is unlikely that differences in clinical outcomes are noted in trials providing less than 5 to 10 years of follow‐up. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about effects of nutritional supplementation compared to no additional intervention on all clinical outcomes for people with non‐alcohol‐related fatty liver disease. 
Accordingly, high‐quality randomised comparative clinical trials with adequate follow‐up are needed. We propose registry‐based randomised clinical trials or cohort multiple randomised clinical trials (study design in which multiple interventions are trialed within large longitudinal cohorts of patients to gain efficiencies and align trials more closely to standard clinical practice) comparing interventions such as vitamin E, prebiotics/probiotics/synbiotics, PUFAs, and no nutritional supplementation. The reason for the choice of interventions is the impact of these interventions on indirect outcomes, which may translate to clinical benefit. Outcomes in such trials should be mortality, health‐related quality of life, decompensated liver cirrhosis, liver transplantation, and resource utilisation measures including costs of intervention and decreased healthcare utilisation after minimum follow‐up of 8 years (to find meaningful differences in clinically important outcomes).

Do Vitamins and Other Supplements Help People with Fatty Liver Disease? A Review of Past Studies

### **Rationale**

Fatty liver disease that is not caused by drinking alcohol is a common health problem. It means there is too much fat built up in a person’s liver. Over time, this extra fat can cause serious problems. It can lead to bad liver scarring, which stops the liver from working right. It can also cause liver cancer or lead to needing a new liver.

Many people want to know if taking supplements can help their fatty liver. Supplements are things like vitamins, minerals, or fish oil that you can buy. But doctors are not sure if these supplements work for fatty liver disease. They also do not know if they are safe for people with this condition. Right now, doctors do not recommend any specific supplements for fatty liver disease.

Researchers did this study to get clearer answers. They wanted to look at all the past research on this topic. Their goal was to find out if any supplements safely helped people with fatty liver disease. This information could help doctors and patients make better choices about treatment.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, the researchers did a special kind of review. They searched for and collected all the good studies that had already been done on this topic. Then, they combined the results from all these studies. This is a way to get a stronger answer than one single study can give. It helps everyone see a bigger picture.

The researchers looked for studies called ""randomized clinical trials."" These are studies where people are put into groups by chance. One group gets a supplement to test. Another group gets a dummy pill, or no treatment at all. This helps make sure the results are fair.

The review included 202 different studies. In total, these studies had over 14,000 people in them. All of these people had fatty liver disease. The studies included both men and women of different ages.

The amount of time people were in these studies varied. The shortest study was one month long. The longest study was a little over two years long. This is the amount of time people were watched to see if the supplements had any effect.

### **Results**

After looking at all the studies, the researchers did not find clear answers. There was not enough good proof to say that any supplement helped people with fatty liver disease. The information from the studies was very uncertain.

The researchers looked for serious health problems like death, liver cancer, or needing a new liver. But these things did not happen very often in the short studies that they reviewed. Because these problems were rare in the studies, the researchers could not tell if the supplements made any difference.

The review did find some information about side effects. Some people took a supplement with a type of fat found in fish oil. These people seemed to have more side effects than people who took no supplement. Some other types of supplements also appeared to cause more side effects. But for most supplements, the proof about side effects was also very unclear.

The researchers believe the results were unclear because the studies were too short. Fatty liver disease gets worse very slowly, over many years. A study that only lasts for one or two years is probably not long enough to see if a treatment can stop serious liver problems. It can take 8 years or more to see these kinds of changes.

The main conclusion from the researchers is that we still do not know if supplements are a good treatment for fatty liver disease. They said we need new, better studies to find the answer. These new studies must last for a much longer time, for at least 8 years. This will help us learn if any supplements are truly safe and can help people with fatty liver disease in the long run.","Nutritional supplementation for people with non‐alcohol‐related fatty liver disease
What is the aim of this Cochrane Review?To find out if any form of nutritional supplementation decreases effects of non‐alcohol‐related fatty liver disease on lifespan, health‐related quality of life, chronic liver disease, and its complications, and whether nutritional supplementation causes any harm. 
Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an accumulation of fat in the liver of people who have no history of significant alcohol consumption, use of medicines, disease such as hepatitis C virus infection, or other conditions such as starvation that can damage the liver. Fatty liver can lead to liver damage resulting in inflammation (non‐alcohol‐related steatohepatitis, or NASH) or liver scarring (liver cirrhosis). Various medical treatments have been tried for treatment of NAFLD. However, no current evidence suggests that any of them work. Nutritional supplementation has the potential to decrease liver damage, but whether this occurs is currently unclear. The authors of this review collected and analysed all relevant randomised clinical trials with the aim of finding out what is the best treatment. They found 202 randomised clinical trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups). During analysis of data, review authors used standard Cochrane methods, which allow comparison of only two treatments at a time. In addition, review authors used advanced techniques that allow comparison of multiple treatments at the same time (usually referred as 'network (or indirect) meta‐analysis'). 
Date of literature searchFebruary 2021. 
Key messagesOnly 19 trials were at low risk of bias, and because of this, uncertainty about the findings of this review is considerable. Studies that reported clinically important liver damage or its complications studied participants for a period of 2 months to 28 months. During this period, clinically important outcomes related to NAFLD such as death, liver‐related complications such as liver cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), liver decompensation (complications caused by scarring of the liver), liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), and death due to liver disease were rare, even without any treatment. No evidence suggests that any nutritional supplementation decreased these. A possible reason for complications of liver disease being rare in trial participants may be the short follow‐up period given in these trials (participants were followed only for a period of 2 months to 28 months). Liver‐related complications due to NAFLD develop over 8 to 28 years. Therefore, it is unlikely that differences in clinical outcomes can be noted in trials with less than 5 to 10 years of follow‐up. 
What was studied in the Review?This Review looked at people of any sex, age, and ethnic origin, with non‐alcohol‐related liver disease. Review authors excluded studies of people with previous liver transplantation. The average age of participants, when reported, ranged from 7 to 61 years. Participants were given different treatments including various vitamins and other nutritional supplements. Review authors wanted to gather and analyse data on death, quality of life, serious and non‐serious adverse events, severe liver damage, complications resulting from severe liver damage, liver cancer, and death due to liver damage ('clinical outcomes').What were the main results of the Review?The 202 studies included 14,200 participants. Study data were sparse. In all, 115 studies with 7732 participants provided data for analyses. Follow‐up of trial participants ranged from 1 month to 28 months (2 months to 28 months for trials that reported clinical outcomes). The Review shows the following.‐ The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about effects of interventions on all clinical outcomes.‐ Well‐designed trials that collect data over longer follow‐up times are needed in the future to find out the best nutritional supplementation (if any) for people with NAFLD.

10.1002-14651858.CD013812,"Background
In response to the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 and the impact of COVID‐19, national and subnational governments implemented a variety of measures in order to control the spread of the virus and the associated disease. While these measures were imposed with the intention of controlling the pandemic, they were also associated with severe psychosocial, societal, and economic implications on a societal level. One setting affected heavily by these measures is the school setting. By mid‐April 2020, 192 countries had closed schools, affecting more than 90% of the world’s student population. In consideration of the adverse consequences of school closures, many countries around the world reopened their schools in the months after the initial closures. To safely reopen schools and keep them open, governments implemented a broad range of measures. 
The evidence with regards to these measures, however, is heterogeneous, with a multitude of study designs, populations, settings, interventions and outcomes being assessed. To make sense of this heterogeneity, we conducted a rapid scoping review (8 October to 5 November 2020). This rapid scoping review is intended to serve as a precursor to a systematic review of effectiveness, which will inform guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). This review is reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA‐ScR) checklist and was registered with the Open Science Framework. 
Objectives
To identify and comprehensively map the evidence assessing the impacts of measures implemented in the school setting to reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the SARS‐CoV‐2/COVID‐19 pandemic, with particular focus on the types of measures implemented in different school settings, the outcomes used to measure their impacts and the study types used to assess these. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, MEDLINE, Embase, the CDC COVID‐19 Research Articles Downloadable Database for preprints, and the WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease on 8 October 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included studies that assessed the impact of measures implemented in the school setting. Eligible populations were populations at risk of becoming infected with SARS‐CoV‐2, or developing COVID‐19 disease, or both, and included people both directly and indirectly impacted by interventions, including students, teachers, other school staff, and contacts of these groups, as well as the broader community. We considered all types of empirical studies, which quantitatively assessed impact including epidemiological studies, modelling studies, mixed‐methods studies, and diagnostic studies that assessed the impact of relevant interventions beyond diagnostic test accuracy. Broad outcome categories of interest included infectious disease transmission‐related outcomes, other harmful or beneficial health‐related outcomes, and societal, economic, and ecological implications. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data from included studies in a standardized manner, and mapped them to categories within our a priori logic model where possible. Where not possible, we inductively developed new categories. In line with standard expectations for scoping reviews, the review provides an overview of the existing evidence regardless of methodological quality or risk of bias, and was not designed to synthesize effectiveness data, assess risk of bias, or characterize strength of evidence (GRADE). 
Main results
We included 42 studies that assessed measures implemented in the school setting. The majority of studies used mathematical modelling designs (n = 31), while nine studies used observational designs, and two studies used experimental or quasi‐experimental designs. Studies conducted in real‐world contexts or using real data focused on the WHO European region (EUR; n = 20), the WHO region of the Americas (AMR; n = 13), the West Pacific region (WPR; n = 6), and the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR; n = 1). One study conducted a global assessment and one did not report on data from, or that were applicable to, a specific country. 
Three broad intervention categories emerged from the included studies: organizational measures to reduce transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 (n = 36), structural/environmental measures to reduce transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 (n = 11), and surveillance and response measures to detect SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (n = 19). Most studies assessed SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission‐related outcomes (n = 29), while others assessed healthcare utilization (n = 8), other health outcomes (n = 3), and societal, economic, and ecological outcomes (n = 5). Studies assessed both harmful and beneficial outcomes across all outcome categories. 
Authors' conclusions
We identified a heterogeneous and complex evidence base of measures implemented in the school setting. This review is an important first step in understanding the available evidence and will inform the development of rapid reviews on this topic.

A Review of Ways to Keep Schools Safe During COVID-19

### **Rationale**

The COVID-19 virus spread very quickly around the world. To slow the spread, leaders in many countries closed schools. In early 2020, more than 9 out of 10 students in the world were not in school.

Closing schools was hard for students, families, and teachers. So, countries worked to reopen them safely. They made many new rules for schools. These rules were meant to stop the virus from spreading.

Many studies were done to see if these rules worked. But the studies were all very different. This made it hard to know which rules were best. Our team wanted to help make sense of all this research. We gathered all the studies we could find. Our goal was to map out what the research said. This review is a first step. It can help groups like the World Health Organization (WHO) make good health guides for schools.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a study with new patients. Instead, we did a review of studies that were already finished. We acted like science librarians. We looked for all the research we could find on COVID-19 safety rules in schools.

We searched large online lists of medical studies in late 2020. We looked for any type of study about this topic. The studies we found were about all the people in a school. This included students, teachers, and other staff. The studies also looked at their families and the towns they live in.

Our team read through all the studies we found. We sorted them into groups based on what they were about. People did not join our study directly. Our work was to collect and map out the past research done by others.

### **Results**

We found 42 studies that looked at safety rules in schools. Most of these studies were computer studies. This means scientists used computers to guess what might happen with different rules. Nine studies looked at what happened in real life. Only two studies were real-world tests of the rules.

The studies looked at three main types of rules for schools:
1.  **Rules for how people act.** This group included 36 studies. They looked at things like wearing masks, keeping students in small groups, and staying far apart from each other.
2.  **Rules for the school building.** This group included 11 studies. They looked at things like opening windows or using fans for better air flow.
3.  **Rules for finding the virus.** This group included 19 studies. They looked at things like testing for the virus and what to do when someone at school gets sick.

Most of the studies looked at how the rules helped stop the virus from spreading. Some studies looked at other things. For example, they checked if fewer people needed to go to the hospital. A few studies looked at how the rules affected people’s daily lives.

The authors who did this review learned a lot. They found that the research on school safety is very complex. There are many different types of studies that look at many different rules. This review is an important first step to understand all the research. It helps show what we know and what we still need to study. This work will help experts write better guides to keep schools safe and open.","Which school‐based measures designed to contain the COVID‐19 pandemic have been evaluated to date, and how were they evaluated? 
Why is this question important? 
To combat the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 and the impact of COVID‐19, countries worldwide have taken a variety of public health measures. In many countries, shutting schools was one of the earliest responses. By mid‐April 2020, 192 countries had closed schools, affecting more than 90% of the world’s student population. This severely disrupted school, family and work life, with likely negative impacts including: 
‐ a worsening of children’s and adolescents’ health and well‐being;‐ increases in inequalities between children and adolescents from disadvantaged and more privileged backgrounds;‐ possible decreased parental income and job security;‐ possible loss of parental economic productivity. 
Given the potential negative consequences of school closures, many countries have since reopened schools. To avoid disease transmission among students, between staff and students, and beyond, a range of school‐based measures have been put in place. These include: 
‐ students and staff wearing face masks and regularly washing their hands;‐ adapting school activities (for example, not singing in music classes);‐ improving ventilation systems; and‐ screening suspected cases of infection. 
To date, we know little about which school‐based measures designed to contain COVID‐19 have been evaluated, and how they have been evaluated. It is important to find this out, so that, in time, we can compare the effectiveness of different measures and inform future policy guidelines. 
We set out to identify and map the evidence on school‐based measures to contain COVID‐19. This work is intended to form the basis of a future review about the effectiveness of these measures. This review will inform guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). 
How did we identify and map the evidence? 
First, we searched for studies that evaluated any intervention set in schools designed to prevent the spread of COVID‐19. We considered all types of studies, and a broad range of outcomes, including: 
‐ infectious disease transmission;‐ other harmful or beneficial effects on health;‐ wider implications for society, the economy, and the population. 
We then grouped studies according to how similar or different they were. This allowed us to gauge: 
‐ which types of study have been used to evaluate measures to date;‐ where studies have been conducted;‐ which types of intervention have been evaluated; and‐ which outcomes have been studied. 
What did we find? 
We found 42 studies.
Type of study 
Thirty‐one studies used mathematical modelling designs, to predict the effects of measures on populations. Two studies used experimental designs, in which researchers divide people or settings into groups to compare the effects of different measures. Nine studies used observational designs, in which researchers simply observed the effect of the intervention. 
Study setting 
Studies were conducted in Europe (20 studies), North and South America (13 studies), the West Pacific (6 studies), and the Eastern Mediterranean (1 study). Most studies evaluated measures in more than one school setting (for example, primary education and secondary education). Three studies focused on secondary schools. 
Type of intervention 
Studies evaluated three broad types of measure:
1. Organizational measures to reduce transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 (36 studies): these included: 
‐ measures designed to limit risks of disease transmission between people who come into contact with each other (such as face‐masks and physical distancing policies); and‐ measures to reduce opportunities for contact (for example, staggered arrival, break and departure times). 
2. Structural or environmental measures to reduce transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 (11 studies): for example, dividing up school playgrounds or improving air circulation. 
3. Surveillance and response measures to detect SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (19 studies): these included: 
‐ testing, tracing, and symptom screening; and‐ isolation of confirmed cases or quarantine of suspected cases. 
Outcomes studied 
Studies assessed the effects of measures on:
‐ SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission (29 studies), including the number of new cases or the average number of people to whom one infected person will pass the virus (reproduction number R);‐ healthcare use (8 studies), for example, the number of hospitalizations;‐ other health outcomes (3 studies), for example, the risk of developing hand eczema (a skin condition); and‐ societal, economic, and other population‐level outcomes (5 studies), including cost. 
What are the implications of our findings? 
A wide range of school‐based measures designed to contain COVID‐19 have been evaluated to date. To evaluate these, researchers have used different methods and investigated different outcomes. This review is an important first step in gauging what evidence is available, and will inform future rapid reviews on this topic.

At least 1 in 200 people have suffered a severe allergic reaction to a sting from a bee, wasp, or ant, and insect stings are the second most common cause of fatal allergic reactions in some countries. Treatment with insect venom, usually given by a course of injections (called venom immunotherapy), is thought to reduce the risk of allergic reactions to an insect sting. In this review, we evaluated the effectiveness of venom immunotherapy for preventing allergic reactions to insect stings. 
From analysis of 7 studies, which included 392 participants, we found that this treatment reduces the chance of having a serious allergic reaction to an insect sting by 90%, a consistent finding between studies. Venom immunotherapy also significantly improves the quality of life of people who have had a serious allergic reaction to an insect sting by reducing anxiety and possible limitation of activities caused by fear of insects. However, almost 1 in 10 people treated with venom immunotherapy during the trials had an allergic reaction to their treatment. We were unable to find out whether venom immunotherapy prevents fatal allergic reactions to insect stings, because these are so rare. The decision whether to start venom immunotherapy depends on an accurate diagnosis, followed by careful assessment of a person's risk of having another allergic reaction to a sting, the degree to which the insect sting allergy affects their quality of life, and the risk of an allergic reaction to their treatment.

Can Allergy Shots Stop Bad Reactions to Insect Stings?

**Rationale**

Some people have bad allergic reactions to insect stings. A sting from a bee, wasp, or ant can be very serious. For about 1 out of 200 people, a sting can cause their body to have a strong and unsafe reaction. These bad reactions can even be deadly.

Because of this, people with a bad insect allergy may feel very scared. They might stop doing things they enjoy outdoors. This fear can make their life hard.

Doctors have a treatment that may help. It is a type of allergy shot. These shots have a tiny, safe amount of the insect venom in them. Venom is the substance in a sting that causes a reaction. The idea is to teach the body to get used to the venom. Over time, the body may stop having a bad reaction to a real sting.

Researchers wanted to know if these allergy shots really work. They also wanted to know if the shots are safe for people. This study looked at past research to find the answers.

**Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new people. Instead, researchers looked at the results of 7 older studies. This is called a review. A review helps to bring all the information together to get a clearer answer.

The 7 studies included a total of 392 people. All of these people had a history of bad allergic reactions to insect stings. The researchers looked at the information from all these people to see what happened when they got the allergy shots.

The paper that we used did not say how long each person was in their study. It focused on the final results from all the studies combined.

**Results**

The researchers found that the allergy shots worked very well. The shots stopped a bad allergic reaction in about 9 out of 10 people who got a new sting. This result was the same across the different studies, which shows the treatment really helps.

The shots also helped people in other ways. People who got the treatment felt less anxious and scared of insects. This helped them live a better life. They could go outside and do more activities without being afraid of getting stung.

However, the treatment has its own risks. About 1 in 10 people had an allergic reaction to the allergy shots themselves. This is an important side effect to think about.

The researchers could not tell if the shots prevent deaths from stings. This is because deaths from stings are very, very rare, so there was not enough information to study this.

The main conclusion is that these allergy shots can be a very good treatment. But the choice to start them is a personal one. A person must talk with their doctor. They should think about how much their allergy affects their life. They also need to understand the risk of having a reaction to the shots.","Immunotherapy for preventing allergic reactions to insect stings

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with dyspnoea, cough or sputum production (or both) and affects quality of life and functional status. More efficient approaches to alternative management that may include patients themselves managing their condition need further exploration in order to reduce the impact on both patients and healthcare services. Digital interventions may potentially impact on health behaviours and encourage patient engagement. 
Objectives
To assess benefits and harms of digital interventions for managing COPD and apply Behaviour Change Technique (BCT) taxonomy to describe and explore intervention content. 
Search methods
We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register (date of last search 28 April 2020). We found other trials at web‐based clinical trials registers. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing digital technology interventions with or without routine supported self‐management to usual care, or control treatment for self‐management. Multi‐component interventions (of which one component was digital self‐management) compared with usual care, standard care or control treatment were included. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Discrepancies were resolved with a third review author. We assessed certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Primary outcomes were impact on health behaviours, self‐efficacy, exacerbations and quality of life, including the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). The minimally important difference (MID) for the SGRQ is 4 points. Two review authors independently applied BCT taxonomy to identify mechanisms in the digital interventions that influence behaviours. 
Main results
Fourteen studies were included in the meta‐analyses (1518 participants) ranging from 13 to 52 weeks duration. Participants had mild to very severe COPD. Risk of bias was high due to lack of blinding. GRADE ratings were low to very low certainty due to lack of blinding and imprecision. Common BCT clusters identified as behaviour change mechanisms in interventions were goals and planning, feedback and monitoring, social support, shaping knowledge and antecedents. 
Digital technology intervention with or without routine supported self‐management 
Interventions included mobile phone (three studies), smartphone applications (one study), and web or Internet‐based (five studies). 
Evidence is very uncertain about effects on impact on health behaviours as measured by six‐minute walk distance (6MWD) at 13 weeks (mean difference (MD) 26.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐21.70 to 74.10; participants = 122; studies = 2) or 23 to 26 weeks (MD 14.31, 95% CI ‐19.41 to 48.03; participants = 164; studies = 3). There may be improvement in 6MWD at 52 weeks (MD 54.33 95% CI ‐35.47 to 144.12; participants = 204; studies = 2) but studies were varied (very low certainty). 
There may be no difference in self‐efficacy on managing Chronic Disease Scale (SEMCD) or pulmonary rehabilitation adapted index of self‐efficacy tool (PRAISE). Evidence is very uncertain. 
Quality of life may be slightly improved on the chronic respiratory disease questionnaire (CRQ) at 13 weeks (MD 0.45, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.90; participants = 123; studies = 2; low certainty), but is not clinically important (MID 0.5). There may be little or no difference at 23 or 52 weeks (low to very low certainty). There may be a clinical improvement on SGRQ total at 52 weeks (MD ‐26.57, 95% CI ‐34.09 to ‐19.05; participants = 120; studies = 1; low certainty). Evidence for COPD assessment test (CAT) and Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) is very uncertain. 
There may be little or no difference in dyspnoea symptoms (CRQ dyspnoea) at 13, 23 weeks or 52 weeks (low to very low certainty evidence) or mean number of exacerbations at 26 weeks (low‐certainty evidence). 
There was no evidence for the number of people experiencing adverse events.
Multi‐component interventions 
Digital components included mobile phone (one study), and web or internet‐based (four studies). 
Evidence is very uncertain about effects on impact on health behaviour (6MWD) at 13 weeks (MD 99.60, 95% CI ‐15.23 to 214.43; participants = 20; studies = 1). 
No evidence was found for self‐efficacy. Four studies reported effects on quality of life (SGRQ and CCQ scales). The evidence is very uncertain. 
There may be no difference in the number of people experiencing exacerbations or mean days to first exacerbation at 52 weeks with a multi‐component intervention compared to standard care. 
Evidence is very uncertain about effects on the number of people experiencing adverse events at 52 weeks. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate a clear benefit or harm of digital technology interventions with or without supported self‐management, or multi‐component interventions compared to usual care in improving the 6MWD or self‐efficacy. We found there may be some short‐term improvement in quality of life with digital interventions, but there is no evidence about whether the effect is sustained long term. Dyspnoea symptoms may improve over a longer duration of digital intervention use. The evidence for multi‐component interventions is very uncertain and as there is little or no evidence for adverse events, we cannot determine the benefit or harm of these interventions. The evidence base is predominantly of very low certainty with concerns around high risk of bias due to lack of blinding. Given that variation of interventions and blinding is likely to be a concern, future, larger studies are needed taking these limitations in consideration. Future studies are needed to determine whether the small improvements observed in this review can be applied to the general COPD population. 
A clear understanding of behaviour change through the BCT classification is important to gauge uptake of digital interventions and health outcomes in people with varying severity of COPD. Currently there is no guidance for interpreting BCT components of a digital intervention for changes to health outcomes. We could not interpret the BCT findings to the health outcomes we were investigating due to limited evidence that was of very low certainty. In future research, standardised approaches need to be considered when designing protocols to investigate effectiveness of digital interventions by including a standardised approach to BCT classification in addition to validated behavioural outcome measures that may reflect changes in behaviour.

Can Phones or Websites Help People Manage Their Lung Disease (COPD)?

### **Rationale**

**What is COPD?**

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, or COPD, is a long-term lung disease. It can make it hard to breathe. People with COPD may feel short of breath. They may also have a cough that does not go away or cough up mucus. Living with COPD can make daily tasks difficult and affect how you feel about your life.

**Why did we do this study?**

Doctors and researchers are always looking for better ways to help people manage their COPD. One idea is to use technology, like a phone app or a website. These tools are called digital tools.

The hope is that these digital tools can help people take a more active role in their own health. For example, a tool could help you track your symptoms or remind you to take your medicine. This study looked at past research to see if there is proof that these digital tools really help people with COPD.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

The researchers did not do a new experiment with patients. Instead, they gathered and reviewed the results of 14 previous studies. Looking at many studies together can give a stronger answer than looking at just one.

The 14 studies included a total of 1,518 people. All of these people had COPD. Their COPD ranged from mild to very severe.

In each study, people were put into groups by chance. One group got the usual care from their doctor. The other group got the usual care plus a digital tool to help them manage their COPD at home. These tools included phone apps, websites, or special mobile phones. The studies lasted from about 3 months to one year.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

After looking at all the studies, the researchers could not find enough proof to say for sure if digital tools help or harm people with COPD. The information from the studies was not clear or strong enough to make a final decision.

**Did the tools help people feel better?**

Some studies showed that using a digital tool might help people feel a little better about their life in the short term (around 3 months). But, we do not know if this feeling lasts over a long time. One study found that people felt much better after using a tool for one year, but more research is needed to be sure.

The results for other health measures were also not clear. The tools did not seem to help people walk farther in a walking test. There was no proof that they helped with shortness of breath or with preventing flare-ups, which is when symptoms get much worse.

**Were the tools safe?**

The studies did not give much information about bad side effects or harm. Because of this, the researchers could not tell if the digital tools were safe for people to use.

**Why were the results not clear?**

Many of the studies had problems in their design. For example, the people in the studies knew they were using a digital tool. This might have changed how they felt or acted. Because of these issues, the researchers are not very sure about the results. They graded the proof from the studies as ""low"" or ""very low"".

**What did the researchers conclude?**

We need more and better research to know if digital tools are useful for people with COPD. Future studies should have more people and be designed in a way that gives clearer answers. This will help us learn if technology can be a good and safe way to support people living with this lung disease.","Digital interventions for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
Review question 
Do digital interventions help people to improve their self‐management of COPD and their health? Do they help to change their behaviour about managing their symptoms? 
What is COPD? 
COPD is a chronic and progressive condition affecting the airways and lungs. Typically, COPD results from prolonged exposure to harmful chemicals found in tobacco smoke, leading to inflammation of the airways, as well as abnormal expansion of the airspaces of the lungs. Owing to the highly varied nature of COPD, there is much variety in how the condition affects individuals’ lives. A persistent cough and breathlessness are characteristic symptoms of COPD, worsening during flare‐ups (exacerbations) and becoming more severe over time. This makes activities of daily living more difficult and greatly impacts quality of life. 
Managing COPD is complex and varies depending on the severity of the condition. Self‐management techniques often play a role in relieving symptoms, such as breathing exercises, as well as a combination of medication and supplementary oxygen. 
'Digital interventions' and 'telehealth' are terms used to encompass the use of technology to communicate and send information between a patient and a healthcare provider ‐ helping to manage the patient’s condition remotely. This may involve (but is not restricted to) the use of a mobile phone or tablet computer application to log symptoms and lung function, allowing a clinician to adjust medications in real‐time. It may also involve remotely training a patient in self‐management techniques. There is scope for those living with COPD to greatly benefit from the use of such interventions, offering convenient and accessible healthcare provision. 
Why did we do this review? 
We wanted to find out if digital interventions were helpful for people with COPD in terms of managing their condition, and if these interventions played a part in changing their behaviour towards self‐management. Additionally, we wanted to understand the behaviour change techniques incorporated in different digital interventions. 
What evidence did we find? 
Mostly, digital interventions or multi component approaches did not improve walking distance or betterment in one's own belief in managing their condition. There was small short‐term improvement in quality of life with Internet‐based interventions but we cannot be certain whether the improvement is seen long term. Breathing difficulties may improve with long‐term use of digital interventions, but they may have little to no effect on flare‐ups. Due to limited data available, we cannot say with confidence that digital interventions can be used to improve health in people with COPD, or that they reduce harm. There is little or no evidence about possible unwanted side‐effects of digital interventions. More research in this field can provide more robust conclusions for their use and insight into people's behaviours towards these novel approaches.

Comparing Two Types of Insulin for People with Type 1 Diabetes

### **Rationale**

**What is type 1 diabetes?**

Type 1 diabetes is a long-term health problem. In type 1 diabetes, the body cannot make enough of a hormone called insulin. People need insulin to help control the sugar in their blood. Without it, blood sugar levels can get too high.

High blood sugar can cause health problems over time. To stay healthy, people with type 1 diabetes must take insulin every day. This helps keep their blood sugar at a safe level.

**Why did we do this study?**

There are different types of insulin. For a long time, doctors used an insulin called NPH. This insulin works for a medium amount of time. It is called an intermediate-acting insulin.

Now, there are newer insulins that work for a longer time. They are called long-acting insulins. These newer insulins are designed to work more like the body’s own insulin. Doctors thought they might work better to control blood sugar. They also hoped these insulins would cause fewer problems, like dangerously low blood sugar. This study looked at past research to see if the newer, long-acting insulins are truly better for patients.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at work that was already done. They combined the results from 23 different studies. This kind of study is called a review.

The review compared two groups of people with type 1 diabetes. One group used the older, intermediate-acting insulin. The other group used one of the newer, long-acting insulins. The researchers noted that the quality of these past studies was not very high.

**Who was in the studies?**

In total, the 23 studies included over 6,700 people. All of these people had type 1 diabetes.

**How long did the studies last?**

All of the studies that the researchers looked at were short. None of the studies lasted for more than one year.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

Researchers looked at a blood test that measures average blood sugar over 2 to 3 months. The group using the newer, long-acting insulin had a slightly lower average blood sugar. But the difference was very small. It was probably not large enough to make a real difference in a person's health.

The main benefit of the long-acting insulins was seen at night. People who took the newer insulins had lower blood sugar levels when they woke up in the morning. They also had fewer episodes of low blood sugar while they were sleeping.

**What did we learn from this study?**

The studies were too short to see if the type of insulin affected long-term health problems from diabetes. Because of this, the researchers could not make strong conclusions.

The results show a small benefit for long-acting insulins, mostly at night. But we need more research to know for sure. Future studies should last for many years. This will help us truly understand the long-term benefits and risks of these newer insulins.","Intermediate acting versus long acting insulin for type 1 diabetes mellitus

10.1002-14651858.CD013187,"Background
Early accurate detection of all skin cancer types is essential to guide appropriate management, reduce morbidity and improve survival. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is usually localised to the skin but has potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue, while cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and melanoma have a much higher potential to metastasise and ultimately lead to death. Exfoliative cytology is a non‐invasive test that uses the Tzanck smear technique to identify disease by examining the structure of cells obtained from scraped samples. This simple procedure is a less invasive diagnostic test than a skin biopsy, and for BCC it has the potential to provide an immediate diagnosis that avoids an additional clinic visit to receive skin biopsy results. This may benefit patients scheduled for either Mohs micrographic surgery or non‐surgical treatments such as radiotherapy. A cytology scrape can never give the same information as a skin biopsy, however, so it is important to better understand in which skin cancer situations it may be helpful. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of exfoliative cytology for detecting basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in adults, and to compare its accuracy with that of standard diagnostic practice (visual inspection with or without dermoscopy). Secondary objectives were: to determine the diagnostic accuracy of exfoliative cytology for detecting cSCC, invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants, and any other skin cancer; and for each of these secondary conditions to compare the accuracy of exfoliative cytology with visual inspection with or without dermoscopy in direct test comparisons; and to determine the effect of observer experience. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also studied the reference lists of published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Studies evaluating exfoliative cytology in adults with lesions suspicious for BCC, cSCC or melanoma, compared with a reference standard of histological confirmation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). Where possible we estimated summary sensitivities and specificities using the bivariate hierarchical model. 
Main results
We synthesised the results of nine studies contributing a total of 1655 lesions to our analysis, including 1120 BCCs (14 datasets), 41 cSCCs (amongst 401 lesions in 2 datasets), and 10 melanomas (amongst 200 lesions in 1 dataset). Three of these datasets (one each for BCC, melanoma and any malignant condition) were derived from one study that also performed a direct comparison with dermoscopy. Studies were of moderate to poor quality, providing inadequate descriptions of participant selection, thresholds used to make cytological and histological diagnoses, and blinding. Reporting of participants' prior referral pathways was particularly poor, as were descriptions of the cytodiagnostic criteria used to make diagnoses. No studies evaluated the use of exfoliative cytology as a primary diagnostic test for detecting BCC or other skin cancers in lesions suspicious for skin cancer. Pooled data from seven studies using standard cytomorphological criteria (but various stain methods) to detect BCC in participants with a high clinical suspicion of BCC estimated the sensitivity and specificity of exfoliative cytology as 97.5% (95% CI 94.5% to 98.9%) and 90.1% (95% CI 81.1% to 95.1%). respectively. When applied to a hypothetical population of 1000 clinically suspected BCC lesions with a median observed BCC prevalence of 86%, exfoliative cytology would miss 21 BCCs and would lead to 14 false positive diagnoses of BCC. No false positive cases were histologically confirmed to be melanoma. Insufficient data are available to make summary statements regarding the accuracy of exfoliative cytology to detect melanoma or cSCC, or its accuracy compared to dermoscopy. 
Authors' conclusions
The utility of exfoliative cytology for the primary diagnosis of skin cancer is unknown, as all included studies focused on the use of this technique for confirming strongly suspected clinical diagnoses. For the confirmation of BCC in lesions with a high clinical suspicion, there is evidence of high sensitivity and specificity. Since decisions to treat low‐risk BCCs are unlikely in practice to require diagnostic confirmation given that clinical suspicion is already high, exfoliative cytology might be most useful for cases of BCC where the treatments being contemplated require a tissue diagnosis (e.g. radiotherapy). The small number of included studies, poor reporting and varying methodological quality prevent us from drawing strong conclusions to guide clinical practice. Despite insufficient data on the use of cytology for cSCC or melanoma, it is unlikely that cytology would be useful in these scenarios since preservation of the architecture of the whole lesion that would be available from a biopsy provides crucial diagnostic information. Given the paucity of good quality data, appropriately designed prospective comparative studies may be required to evaluate both the diagnostic value of exfoliative cytology by comparison to dermoscopy, and its confirmatory value in adequately reported populations with a high probability of BCC scheduled for further treatment requiring a tissue diagnosis.

### **A New Look at a Skin Scrape Test for Finding Skin Cancer**

#### **Why was this study done?**

Skin cancer is a common disease. It is very important to find it early. Finding it early helps doctors treat it well and can save lives.

There are different types of skin cancer.
*   **Basal cell carcinoma (BCC)** is the most common type. It usually stays in one spot on the skin but can damage the area around it.
*   **Squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC)** and **melanoma** are other types. They are more serious because they can spread to other parts of the body.

To know for sure if a spot on your skin is cancer, doctors often do a biopsy. For a biopsy, a doctor cuts out a small piece of skin to test in a lab. This can be a bit painful and may leave a scar. You also have to wait for the results.

Researchers wanted to look at a simpler test. It is a skin scrape test. For this test, a doctor gently scrapes cells from the top of a skin spot. It is not as invasive as a biopsy. It could also give results faster. This study looked at past research to see how well this skin scrape test works to find skin cancer.

#### **How was this study designed?**

This was not a study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked for all the studies that were already done on this topic. This kind of study is called a review.

The researchers looked for studies that included adults. These adults had skin spots that a doctor thought might be cancer. The researchers found 9 studies to include in their review. In total, these studies looked at over 1,600 skin spots from more than 1,300 people.

In these studies, patients had both the skin scrape test and a biopsy on the same spot. The researchers then compared the results. A biopsy is the best way to know for sure if a spot is cancer, so it was used to judge how good the skin scrape test was.

#### **What were the main results of the study?**

The review found that the skin scrape test was quite good at confirming one type of skin cancer called BCC. The studies used this test when a doctor already had a strong feeling that a spot was BCC.

To make this easier to understand, let's imagine 100 people have a spot that a doctor thinks is BCC.
*   Let’s say 86 of these people really do have BCC. The skin scrape test would correctly find the cancer in about 84 of these 86 people. It would miss the cancer in 2 people.
*   The other 14 people do not have cancer. The skin scrape test would correctly show no cancer in about 13 of these 14 people. It would wrongly say 1 person has cancer when they do not.

The researchers found there was not enough information to know how well the skin scrape test works for other skin cancers, like melanoma or cSCC.

The researchers who did the review came to a few conclusions. They said the skin scrape test should not be the first test used to check a strange spot on the skin. But, it might be useful to *confirm* that a spot is BCC when a doctor is already very sure. This could be helpful before some treatments, like radiation, where a tissue sample is needed. For other serious skin cancers, like melanoma, a biopsy is still very important. A biopsy gives doctors more information than a scrape test can.

The researchers also noted that the studies they reviewed were small and not of the best quality. This means more and better studies are needed to be sure about when to use the skin scrape test.","How accurate is exfoliative cytology ('skin scrape' cytology) for diagnosing basal cell carcinoma and other skin cancers in adults? 
Why is improving the diagnosis of skin cancer important? 
There are a number of different types of skin cancer. The most common is basal cell carcinoma (BCC). BCC is a localised cancer that can grow and destroy the skin around it. They rarely spread into the body like other cancers can. Very small or superficial low‐risk BCCs can generally be treated with treatments such as creams rather than surgery, while it is better to surgically remove BCCs that are more likely to grow and spread. Radiotherapy (a treatment where radiation is used to kill cancer cells) can also be used if BCCs are very large or cannot be removed by surgery. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is also usually a localised skin cancer. In a small proportion of cases it can spread to other parts of the body, so the best treatment is to remove it using surgery. Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer as it has a higher potential to spread to other parts of the body, and so it is vital to recognise it and remove it early. If people with BCC do not receive the correct diagnosis (known as a false negative test result), their treatment can be delayed, making the surgical procedure more complicated. Diagnosing BCC when it is actually something else (a false positive result) may result in unnecessary treatment, surgery or other investigations and can cause the patient stress and anxiety. If BCC is incorrectly diagnosed in an individual who actually has an cSCC or melanoma, effective treatment can be delayed and this might lead to a greater chance that the cSCC or melanoma spreads to other organs in the body, which can be very serious. 
What is the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate a technique called 'exfoliative cytology' is for diagnosing skin cancer. Researchers in Cochrane found nine studies to answer this question. Nine studies were concerned with the diagnosis of BCC, two with the diagnosis of cSCC and one with the diagnosis of melanoma. 
What was studied in the review? 
Exfoliative cytology means scraping the surface of a possible skin cancer with a knife and then spreading a small layer of the scrape onto a glass slide so that the cells in the scrape can be stained and looked at under a microscope. It is less invasive than skin biopsy and quick to perform, with results available immediately. This could save patients an additional clinic visit to receive skin biopsy results. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review examined nine studies with a total of 1655 lesions (a mole or area of skin with an unusual appearance in comparison with the surrounding skin) that were given these final diagnoses*: 1120 BCCs, 41 cSCCs and 10 melanomas. 
For identifying BCC, seven studies show the effect of using exfoliative cytology to confirm BCC in lesions that doctors already suspected were BCCs. In a group of 1000 such lesions, of which 860 (86%) actually do have BCC, then: 
‐ an estimated 853 people will have an exfoliative cytology result confirming that a BCC is present. Of these 14 (1.6%) will not actually have a BCC (false positive result); 
‐ of the 147 people with an exfoliative cytology result indicating that no BCC is present, 21 (14%) will in fact actually have a BCC (false negative result). 
One study compared the accuracy of exfoliative cytology to using a hand‐held microscope (dermoscopy) for making a diagnosis of BCC but used a different method of removing cells and included patients with a higher risk of melanoma than found in the other eight studies. 
There was not enough evidence to determine the accuracy of exfoliative cytology for diagnosing cSCC or melanoma. 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
The small number of studies included in this review, poor description of how patients were selected to be included in the study, and limited information on how the test results were used to make diagnoses, reduces the reliability of our results. 
The studies did not explain how patients had been referred to have the exfoliative cytology test. Most important of all, the test was only used in people in whom doctors had already diagnosed a BCC just by looking at the skin lesion. In other words, the test was being used to confirm a doctor's diagnosis. Most studies did not include enough people with skin lesions that are similar in appearance to a BCC to be sure that this test correctly identifies a BCC. This may cause exfoliative cytology to appear more accurate than it would be in actual practice. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies were conducted in the UK, across Europe and in Australia. Study authors rarely described patient characteristics, such as age and location of the lesion. The percentage of people included in the studies with a final diagnosis of BCC ranged from 18% to 90% (nine studies). For cSCC it was 4% and 18% (two studies), and for melanoma it was 5% (one study). It was not possible to tell from the studies how clinicians had decided that study participants had lesions that could be a skin cancer. 
What are the implications of this review? 
No research has been done using exfoliative cytology to diagnose a skin cancer when a patient is first seen by a doctor. The results of this review suggest that exfoliative cytology can help to confirm BCC in patients with skin lesions that a doctor already suspects of being a BCC. This test could be useful for patients with BCCs that need non‐surgical treatments, such as radiotherapy, where a tissue diagnosis is needed before the treatment can be given. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies, biopsy was the reference standard (means of establishing the final diagnosis).

10.1002-14651858.CD013694.pub2,"Background
Tuberculosis is a leading cause of infectious disease‐related death and is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of specific rapid molecular tests, including Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra, as initial diagnostic tests for the detection of tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in people with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis. However, the WHO estimates that nearly one‐third of all active tuberculosis cases go undiagnosed and unreported. We were interested in whether a single test, Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra, could be useful as a screening test to close this diagnostic gap and improve tuberculosis case detection. 
Objectives
To estimate the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra for screening for pulmonary tuberculosis in adults, irrespective of signs or symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis in high‐risk groups and in the general population. Screening ""irrespective of signs or symptoms"" refers to screening of people who have not been assessed for the presence of tuberculosis symptoms (e.g. cough). 
To estimate the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra for detecting rifampicin resistance in adults screened for tuberculosis, irrespective of signs and symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis in high‐risk groups and in the general population. 
Search methods
We searched 12 databases including the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE and Embase, on 19 March 2020 without language restrictions. We also reviewed reference lists of included articles and related Cochrane Reviews, and contacted researchers in the field to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
Cross‐sectional and cohort studies in which adults (15 years and older) in high‐risk groups (e.g. people living with HIV, household contacts of people with tuberculosis) or in the general population were screened for pulmonary tuberculosis using Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra. For tuberculosis detection, the reference standard was culture. For rifampicin resistance detection, the reference standards were culture‐based drug susceptibility testing and line probe assays. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data using a standardized form and assessed risk of bias and applicability using QUADAS‐2. We used a bivariate random‐effects model to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) separately for tuberculosis detection and rifampicin resistance detection. We estimated all models using a Bayesian approach. For tuberculosis detection, we first estimated screening accuracy in distinct high‐risk groups, including people living with HIV, household contacts, people residing in prisons, and miners, and then in several high‐risk groups combined. 
Main results
We included a total of 21 studies: 18 studies (13,114 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF as a screening test for pulmonary tuberculosis and one study (571 participants) evaluated both Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra. Three studies (159 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance. Fifteen studies (75%) were conducted in high tuberculosis burden and 16 (80%) in high TB/HIV‐burden countries. We judged most studies to have low risk of bias in all four QUADAS‐2 domains and low concern for applicability. 
Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra as screening tests for pulmonary tuberculosis 
In people living with HIV (12 studies), Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% CrI) were 61.8% (53.6 to 69.9) (602 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and 98.8% (98.0 to 99.4) (4173 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 50 have tuberculosis on culture, 40 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive; of these, 9 (22%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); and 960 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative; of these, 19 (2%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives). 
In people living with HIV (1 study), Xpert Ultra sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) were 69% (57 to 80) (68 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and 98% (97 to 99) (503 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 50 have tuberculosis on culture, 53 would be Xpert Ultra‐positive; of these, 19 (36%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); and 947 would be Xpert Ultra‐negative; of these, 16 (2%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives). 
In non‐hospitalized people in high‐risk groups (5 studies), Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity were 69.4% (47.7 to 86.2) (337 participants, low‐certainty evidence) and 98.8% (97.2 to 99.5) (8619 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 10 have tuberculosis on culture, 19 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive; of these, 12 (63%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); and 981 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative; of these, 3 (0%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives). 
We did not identify any studies using Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra for screening in the general population. 
Xpert MTB/RIF as a screening test for rifampicin resistance 
Xpert MTB/RIF sensitivity was 81% and 100% (2 studies, 20 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), and specificity was 94% to 100%, (3 studies, 139 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Of the high‐risks groups evaluated, Xpert MTB/RIF applied as a screening test was accurate for tuberculosis in high tuberculosis burden settings. Sensitivity and specificity were similar in people living with HIV and non‐hospitalized people in high‐risk groups. In people living with HIV, Xpert Ultra sensitivity was slightly higher than that of Xpert MTB/RIF and specificity similar. As there was only one study of Xpert Ultra in this analysis, results should be interpreted with caution. There were no studies that evaluated the tests in people with diabetes mellitus and other groups considered at high‐risk for tuberculosis, or in the general population.

**Plain Title**

Using a Quick Test to Find Hidden Lung Tuberculosis

**Rationale**

Tuberculosis, or TB, is a serious disease that affects the lungs. It is caused by a germ and spreads from person to person through the air. TB is one of the top 10 causes of death in the world. Many people who have TB do not know they are sick. This is a problem because they can spread the disease to others and they do not get the medicine they need.

There are quick tests that can find TB. These tests are called Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra. Doctors use them for people who have signs of TB, like a bad cough.

Researchers in this study wanted to know if these quick tests could also be used to find TB in people who do not feel sick. The goal was to see if the tests could find these ""hidden"" cases of TB, especially in groups of people who are more likely to get the disease. Finding TB early can help stop its spread and help people get well sooner.

**Trial Design**

To answer their question, the researchers did not do a new study with patients. Instead, they looked at the results of 21 past studies that had already been done. Combining the results from many studies can give a stronger answer.

The studies they looked at included adults who were 15 years or older. These adults were part of groups who have a higher risk of getting TB. These high-risk groups included people living with HIV, people who had close contact with someone with TB, and miners.

The researchers looked at the data from these studies to see how well the quick Xpert tests worked to find TB in these groups of people.

**Results**

The researchers found that the Xpert tests were useful for finding hidden TB in people at high risk. However, the tests were not perfect.

For people living with HIV, the Xpert MTB/RIF test gave these results:
*   Imagine a group of 1000 people with HIV. If 50 of them truly have TB, the test would find TB in about 40 people.
*   But, about 9 of those 40 people would not really have TB. This is called a false positive.
*   The test would miss about 19 people who did have TB. This is called a false negative.

A newer test, called Xpert Ultra, was also studied in people with HIV. This test seemed to find a few more cases of TB than the older test. But this result was from only one small study, so we need more research to be sure.

For other high-risk groups, the Xpert MTB/RIF test worked in a similar way. It helped find some hidden cases of TB. But it also missed some cases and sometimes said people had TB when they did not. The study did not find any research on using these tests to screen the general public.

The main message from this research is that the quick Xpert tests can be helpful tools. They can be used to check for TB in groups of people who are at a high risk of getting sick. This could help doctors find and treat more people, which would help stop the spread of TB. More research is still needed to see how well these tests work in other groups, like people with diabetes.","How accurate are sputum Xpert tests for screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults whether or not they have tuberculosis symptoms? 
Why is using Xpert tests to screen for pulmonary tuberculosis important? 
Tuberculosis is the leading cause of infectious disease‐related death and one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using specific rapid tests as initial tests for diagnosing tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in people with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis. However, the WHO estimates that nearly one‐third of all active tuberculosis cases go undiagnosed and unreported. Not recognizing tuberculosis when it is present (a false negative test result) may result in illness and death and an increased risk of infecting others. An incorrect diagnosis of tuberculosis (false‐positive result) may mean that people are given antibiotics when there is no benefit to be gained. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To estimate the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra as screening tests for pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults whether or not they have tuberculosis symptoms (such as cough, fever, weight loss, and night sweats). We were interested in how the tests worked in groups at high risk for tuberculosis, including people living with HIV (PLHIV), household contacts of people with tuberculosis, miners, people residing in prisons, people with diabetes, and in the general public. 
What was studied in this review? 
Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra are rapid tests for simultaneously diagnosing tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. We combined study results to determine: 
‐ sensitivity: people with tuberculosis (rifampicin resistance) correctly diagnosed as having the condition. 
‐ specificity: people without tuberculosis (rifampicin resistance) correctly identified as not having the condition. 
The closer sensitivity and specificity are to 100%, the better the test.
What are the main results in this review? 
Twenty‐one studies: 18 studies (13,114 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF as a screening test for pulmonary tuberculosis and one study (571 participants) evaluated both Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra. Three studies (159 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance. 
For every 1000 people tested, if 50 had tuberculosis according to the reference standard:
PLHIV 
‐ Xpert MTB/RIF (12 studies):
· 40 people would test positive, including 9 without tuberculosis (62% sensitivity)
· 960 people would test negative, including 19 with tuberculosis (99% specificity)
‐ Xpert Ultra (1 study):
· 53 people would test positive, including 19 without tuberculosis (69% sensitivity)
· 947 people would test negative, including 16 with tuberculosis (98% specificity)
For every 1000 people tested, if 10 had tuberculosis according to the reference standard:
Other high‐risk groups combined 
‐ Xpert MTB/RIF (5 studies):
· 19 people would test positive, including 12 without tuberculosis (69% sensitivity)
· 981 people would test negative, including 3 with tuberculosis (99% specificity)
For detection of rifampicin resistance, Xpert MTB/RIF sensitivity was 81% and 100% (2 studies) and specificity was 94% to 100% (3 studies). 
How reliable are the results of the studies in this review? 
In the included studies, the reference standards for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis (culture) and rifampicin resistance (drug susceptibility testing) are likely to have been reliable methods for deciding whether patients really had the conditions. We were fairly confident in the results for Xpert MTB/RIF in PLHIV, and less so for other high‐risk groups. Not enough people have been studied to be confident about the results for Xpert Ultra or for detection of rifampicin resistance. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies were mainly performed in high tuberculosis and high HIV burden settings. No studies evaluated the tests in people with diabetes mellitus or the general population. 
What are the implications of this review? 
In PLHIV, Xpert MTB/RIF as a screening test was accurate for tuberculosis in high tuberculosis burden settings. In high‐risk groups, Xpert MTB/RIF may assist in identifying tuberculosis, but the certainty of evidence is low. In PLHIV, Xpert Ultra sensitivity was slightly higher than that of Xpert MTB/RIF and specificity similar based on one study. There were few studies and few people tested for rifampicin resistance and no studies that evaluated the tests in people with diabetes or in the general population.

10.1002-14651858.CD012584.pub2,"To continue taking or to stop taking antiplatelet drugs for a few days before non‐cardiac surgery in adults 
Review question 
We set out to determine whether continuing to take antiplatelet drugs before non‐cardiac surgery that requires general, spinal or regional anaesthesia increases the risk of experiencing serious bleeding, ischaemic event or death in adults, when compared with stopping antiplatelet drugs for at least five days before non‐cardiac surgery. 
Background 
Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin or clopidogrel reduce the risk of people getting blood clots, and are routinely prescribed for people who have had coronary stents inserted. They are also recommended for people with unstable angina or heart disease, or people who have had a heart attack, heart surgery or a stroke. Taking antiplatelet therapy introduces an increased risk of bleeding, which could lead to problems if a person needs non‐cardiac surgery. Stopping usual antiplatelet therapy a few days before surgery might reduce the risk of serious bleeding during surgery. Not taking these antiplatelet drugs could, however, increase the risk of a heart attack, stroke, or death. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence from randomized controlled trials is current to January 2018. We included five trials with 666 adults in the review. Three studies are ongoing. All participants were taking antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) at the start of the study. Two studies stopped antiplatelet drugs for at least five days before surgery, and three studies gave participants a placebo instead of antiplatelet therapy during this time. 
Key results 
We found low‐certainty evidence that either continuing or stopping antiplatelet therapy may make little or no difference to the number of people who died up to 30 days or six months after surgery (five studies, 659 participants). We found moderate‐certainty evidence that either continuing or stopping antiplatelet therapy probably makes little or no difference to incidences of bleeding serious enough to need a blood transfusion during or immediately after surgery (four studies, 368 participants). We found low‐certainty evidence that either continuing or stopping antiplatelet therapy may make little or no difference to bleeding serious enough to need further surgery (four studies, 368 participants), and may make little or no difference to the number of ischaemic events such as stroke or heart attack (four studies, 616 participants). 
Quality of the evidence 
Some studies had low risk of bias because they had clearly reported their methods for randomizing people to each group, and three studies used a placebo agent so that people did not know whether or not they were continuing their usual antiplatelet therapy. However, we found few studies with few events, with wide variation in results. To continue or stop taking antiplatelet drugs for a few days before non‐cardiac surgery might make little or no difference to the number of people who died, who had bleeding that needed further surgery or who had ischaemic events, and it probably makes little or no difference to bleeding that needed a blood transfusion. We found three ongoing studies which will increase certainty in the effect in future updates of the review.

### **Plain Title**

Is it Safer to Stop or Keep Taking Blood-Thinning Drugs Before an Operation?

### **Rationale**

Many people take medicines that help prevent blood clots. These drugs are often called blood thinners. Doctors give them to people who have had a heart attack, a stroke, or heart surgery. They are also for people with heart problems. These drugs, like aspirin or clopidogrel, are very important. They help stop dangerous clots from forming in the body.

But these medicines also raise the chance of bleeding. This can be a problem if a person needs an operation that is not on the heart. Doctors have a tough choice. Should they tell their patients to stop taking their blood thinner a few days before surgery? This could lower the risk of too much bleeding during the operation.

Or should patients keep taking their medicine? Stopping the drug, even for a few days, could raise the risk of a blood clot. This could lead to a heart attack or a stroke. Doctors and patients need to know which choice is safer. This review of studies was done to find an answer. Researchers wanted to see if stopping or continuing these drugs changed the risk of serious problems.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of past studies. They wanted to combine the information to get a stronger answer. This is called a review.

The researchers looked for studies that were well-designed. They found five studies to include in their review. A total of 666 adults were in these five studies. All of these adults were taking a medicine to prevent blood clots before their operation.

In these studies, people were put into two groups by chance. One group stopped taking their blood-thinning drug at least five days before surgery. The other group kept taking their medicine. In some studies, people in the “stop” group were given a placebo. A placebo is a pill with no medicine in it, like a sugar pill. This helped make sure the results were fair, as people did not know which treatment they were getting.

### **Results**

Researchers looked at what happened to the people in the studies. They wanted to know if one group did better than the other.

They found that it may make little or no difference if people stopped or continued their medicine. The number of people who died within a month or six months after surgery was about the same in both groups. But the researchers were not very sure about this result.

They also looked at bleeding. The results showed that stopping or continuing the drug probably made little or no difference in serious bleeding. This means the number of people who needed a blood transfusion was about the same in both groups. Researchers were more sure about this finding.

Finally, they looked at the risk of blood clots. The number of people who had a heart attack or a stroke was also about the same in both groups. Again, this suggests it may make little or no difference if patients stopped or continued their drug before an operation.

In the end, the researchers concluded that either choice might be safe. For patients, this review shows there may be little or no difference in bad outcomes between stopping or continuing blood thinners. However, the researchers noted that they did not have a lot of information. More research is needed to be certain. There are three new studies happening now. Their results will help make the answer to this important question clearer in the future.","To continue taking or to stop taking antiplatelet drugs for a few days before non‐cardiac surgery in adults

10.1002-14651858.CD015207,"Background
Elevated blood pressure, or hypertension, is the leading cause of preventable deaths globally. Diets high in sodium (predominantly sodium chloride) and low in potassium contribute to elevated blood pressure. The WHO recommends decreasing mean population sodium intake through effective and safe strategies to reduce hypertension and its associated disease burden. Incorporating low‐sodium salt substitutes (LSSS) into population strategies has increasingly been recognised as a possible sodium reduction strategy, particularly in populations where a substantial proportion of overall sodium intake comes from discretionary salt. The LSSS contain lower concentrations of sodium through its displacement with potassium predominantly, or other minerals. Potassium‐containing LSSS can potentially simultaneously decrease sodium intake and increase potassium intake.  Benefits of LSSS include their potential blood pressure‐lowering effect and relatively low cost. However, there are concerns about potential adverse effects of LSSS, such as hyperkalaemia, particularly in people at risk, for example, those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or taking medications that impair potassium excretion. 
Objectives
To assess the effects and safety of replacing salt with LSSS to reduce sodium intake on cardiovascular health in adults, pregnant women and children. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate Analytics), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL, EBSCOhost), ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 18 August 2021, and screened reference lists of included trials and relevant systematic reviews. No language or publication restrictions were applied. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective analytical cohort studies in participants of any age in the general population, from any setting in any country. This included participants with non‐communicable diseases and those taking medications that impair potassium excretion. Studies had to compare any type and method of implementation of LSSS with the use of regular salt, or no active intervention, at an individual, household or community level, for any duration. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full‐text articles to determine eligibility; and extracted data, assessed risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB tool, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We stratified analyses by adults, children (≤ 18 years) and pregnant women. Primary effectiveness outcomes were change in diastolic and systolic blood pressure (DBP and SBP), hypertension and blood pressure control; cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality were additionally assessed as primary effectiveness outcomes in adults. Primary safety outcomes were change in blood potassium, hyperkalaemia and hypokalaemia. 
Main results
We included 26 RCTs, 16 randomising individual participants and 10 randomising clusters (families, households or villages). A total of 34,961 adult participants and 92 children were randomised to either LSSS or regular salt, with the smallest trial including 10 and the largest including 20,995 participants. No studies in pregnant women were identified. Studies included only participants with hypertension (11/26), normal blood pressure (1/26), pre‐hypertension (1/26), or participants with and without hypertension (11/26). This was unknown in the remaining studies. The largest study included only participants with an elevated risk of stroke at baseline. Seven studies included adult participants possibly at risk of hyperkalaemia. All 26 trials specifically excluded participants in whom an increased potassium intake is known to be potentially harmful. The majority of trials were conducted in rural or suburban settings, with more than half (14/26) conducted in low‐ and middle‐income countries. 
The proportion of sodium chloride replacement in the LSSS interventions varied from approximately 3% to 77%. The majority of trials (23/26) investigated LSSS where potassium‐containing salts were used to substitute sodium. In most trials, LSSS implementation was discretionary (22/26). Trial duration ranged from two months to nearly five years.  
We assessed the overall risk of bias as high in six trials and unclear in 12 trials.
LSSS compared to regular salt in adults: LSSS compared to regular salt probably reduce DBP on average (mean difference (MD) ‐2.43 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3.50 to ‐1.36; 20,830 participants, 19 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence) and SBP (MD ‐4.76 mmHg, 95% CI ‐6.01 to ‐3.50; 21,414 participants, 20 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence) slightly.  
On average, LSSS probably reduce non‐fatal stroke (absolute effect (AE) 20 fewer/100,000 person‐years, 95% CI ‐40 to 2; 21,250 participants, 3 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence), non‐fatal acute coronary syndrome (AE 150 fewer/100,000 person‐years, 95% CI ‐250 to ‐30; 20,995 participants, 1 RCT, moderate‐certainty evidence) and cardiovascular mortality (AE 180 fewer/100,000 person‐years, 95% CI ‐310 to 0; 23,200 participants, 3 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence) slightly, and probably increase blood potassium slightly (MD 0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.18; 784 participants, 6 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence), compared to regular salt.  
LSSS may result in little to no difference, on average, in hypertension (AE 17 fewer/1000, 95% CI ‐58 to 17; 2566 participants, 1 RCT, low‐certainty evidence) and hyperkalaemia (AE 4 more/100,000, 95% CI ‐47 to 121; 22,849 participants, 5 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence) compared to regular salt. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of LSSS on blood pressure control, various cardiovascular events, stroke mortality, hypokalaemia, and other adverse events (very‐low certainty evidence). 
LSSS compared to regular salt in children: The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of LSSS on DBP and SBP in children. We found no evidence about the effects of LSSS on hypertension, blood pressure control, blood potassium, hyperkalaemia and hypokalaemia in children. 
Authors' conclusions
When compared to regular salt, LSSS probably reduce blood pressure, non‐fatal cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality slightly in adults. However, LSSS also probably increase blood potassium slightly in adults. These small effects may be important when LSSS interventions are implemented at the population level. Evidence is limited for adults without elevated blood pressure, and there is a lack of evidence in pregnant women and people in whom an increased potassium intake is known to be potentially harmful, limiting conclusions on the safety of LSSS in the general population. We also cannot draw firm conclusions about effects of non‐discretionary LSSS implementations. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of LSSS on blood pressure in children.

### Plain Title

Can Using a Special Salt Lower Your Blood Pressure?

### Rationale

High blood pressure is a serious health issue that affects many people all over the world. It often has no symptoms, so you may not know you have it. Over time, high blood pressure can damage your heart and blood vessels. This can lead to major problems like a heart attack or a stroke.

The food we eat plays a big part in our blood pressure. Eating too much salt is a common cause of high blood pressure. Regular table salt is made of a substance called sodium. Our bodies need a little sodium, but too much is not healthy.

This study looked at a special kind of salt called a low-sodium salt substitute. This special salt has less sodium than regular salt. To make it, some of the sodium is replaced with another mineral called potassium. Getting more potassium in your diet can also help lower blood pressure.

Researchers wanted to see if this special salt could help people. They studied if it could lower blood pressure and prevent heart problems. They also needed to check if it was safe for people to use every day. Some people, like those with kidney problems, must be careful not to get too much potassium, so safety was very important to check.

### Trial Design

This research was a review study. This means the team did not do a new experiment. Instead, they gathered and studied the results from many other studies that were already done. This is a good way to get a bigger and stronger answer to a health question.

The team looked at 26 different studies. These studies were designed to be very fair. People in the studies were put into groups by chance. One group used the special low-sodium salt. The other group used regular salt. This allows researchers to see the real effects of the special salt.

The studies included almost 35,000 adults and about 90 children. The people in the studies were from many different countries. Some had high blood pressure, and some did not. The researchers could not find any studies that looked at pregnant women. The studies lasted for different amounts of time, from two months to almost five years.

### Results

The review found good news for adults. Using the special low-sodium salt instead of regular salt helped to lower blood pressure. It lowered both the top and bottom numbers of a blood pressure reading by a small but meaningful amount.

Using the special salt also seemed to protect people from serious health problems. It appeared to slightly lower the chances of having a stroke or other heart issues. The risk of dying from a heart condition was also slightly lower for people who used the special salt.

The researchers also checked for side effects. They found that the special salt did cause a small increase in the amount of potassium in the blood. For the people in these studies, this small increase did not seem to be dangerous. It is important to know that these studies did not include people who are known to have problems with high potassium.

There was not enough information to say if the special salt is good for children. More research is needed to know how it affects them.

The study leaders concluded that for most adults, using a low-sodium salt is likely a good thing. Even small health benefits can make a big difference for a whole country. It could prevent many strokes and save many lives. But they also say we need to be careful. We do not have enough information for some groups, like children, pregnant women, and people with kidney disease. More research is needed to make sure this special salt is safe for everyone to use.","Does using low‐sodium salt substitutes (LSSS) instead of regular salt reduce blood pressure and heart disease risks, and is it safe? 
Key messages 
• In adults, using LSSS instead of regular salt in food probably lowers blood pressure slightly. Adults using LSSS instead of regular salt probably have a slightly lower risk of non‐fatal heart conditions, such as stroke or a sudden reduced blood flow to the heart, and death from heart disease. 
• Using LSSS instead of regular salt probably also slightly increases the level of blood potassium (a mineral that keeps your heart beating at the right pace) in adults. This could be harmful for people who cannot effectively regulate the potassium in their bodies. Other evidence on safety is very limited. 
• We are not certain about effects of using LSSS instead of regular salt on blood pressure in children, or whether using LSSS is safe in children. 
• This evidence may not directly apply to people known to be at risk of high blood potassium, such as people with kidney problems or on certain medications. 
What are low‐sodium salt substitutes (LSSS)? 
LSSS are products with less sodium than regular salt. Amounts of sodium in LSSS are lowered by replacing some of the sodium with potassium or other minerals. LSSS may help lower risks of using regular salt, since eating lots of sodium and not enough potassium contributes to high blood pressure. Globally, high blood pressure is the largest cause of preventable deaths, mainly because it causes stroke, acute coronary syndrome (ACS; where less blood flows to the heart), and kidney problems. 
However, LSSS also has potential health risks. Using LSSS may lead to higher than normal blood potassium (hyperkalaemia), which causes problems with the heartbeat speed and rhythm, or can cause the heart to stop. These risks are greater in certain people, for example, those whose kidneys do not work properly to remove potassium. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out what the effects of using LSSS instead of regular salt are on blood pressure as well as on events (stroke and ACS) and heart disease death. We also wanted to know if using LSSS instead of regular salt is safe, both in the general population and in people who are known to be at risk of high blood potassium levels. 
We wanted to find this out for adults, children and pregnant women.
What did we do?We searched five electronic databases and trial registries for studies that compared using LSSS with using regular salt. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the combined evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.  
What did we find? 
We found 26 trials* involving 34,961 adults and 92 children. No studies in pregnant women were found. Most trials were undertaken in rural or suburban areas, with more than half done in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Most trials included some people with high blood pressure (22); the largest included only people with a high risk of stroke. Seven trials were done in people at possible risk of high blood potassium. All trials excluded people where high potassium intake is known to be harmful, such as people with kidney problems or on certain medications. Nearly all trials (23) examined LSSS types where some sodium was replaced with potassium. The amount of sodium replaced in the various LSSS used in the trials ranged from very small (3%) to large (77%). 
*Trials are types of studies in which participants are assigned randomly to two or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure similar groups of participants. 
Main results 
In adults, LSSS probably lowers blood pressure (diastolic and systolic) slightly when compared to regular salt. Using LSSS also probably lowers risk of non‐fatal stroke, non‐fatal ACS and heart disease death slightly when compared to regular salt. 
However, using LSSS instead of regular salt probably also slightly increases the level of potassium in the blood. 
Compared to regular salt, LSSS may result in little to no difference in high blood pressure and hyperkalaemia. 
We could not draw any conclusions about effects of LSSS on blood pressure control, various heart disease events, death caused by stroke, lower than normal blood potassium (hypokalaemia), and other adverse events. 
We could not draw any conclusions about the effects or safety of using LSSS instead of regular salt in children. 
What are the limitations of the evidence?  
We are moderately confident in the evidence. Our confidence was lowered mainly because of concerns about how some trials were conducted, and whether the results apply to the general population. We are not sure about the effects and safety of LSSS in children, pregnant women, people known to have a risk of high blood potassium, or those who do not have high blood pressure. We are also unsure about the effects of LSSS when used in foods not prepared at home. Further research may change these results. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to August 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013669.pub2,"Background
Self‐harm (SH; intentional self‐poisoning or self‐injury regardless of degree of suicidal intent or other types of motivation) is a growing problem in most countries, often repeated, and associated with suicide. Evidence assessing the effectiveness of pharmacological agents and/or natural products in the treatment of SH is lacking, especially when compared with the evidence for psychosocial interventions. This review therefore updates a previous Cochrane Review (last published in 2015) on the role of pharmacological interventions for SH in adults. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of pharmacological agents or natural products for SH compared to comparison types of treatment (e.g. placebo or alternative pharmacological treatment) for adults (aged 18 years or older) who engage in SH. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Specialised Register, the Cochrane Library (Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL] and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews [CDSR]), together with MEDLINE. Ovid Embase and PsycINFO (to 4 July 2020). 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pharmacological agents or natural products with placebo/alternative pharmacological treatment in individuals with a recent (within six months of trial entry) episode of SH resulting in presentation to hospital or clinical services. The primary outcome was the occurrence of a repeated episode of SH over a maximum follow‐up period of two years. Secondary outcomes included treatment acceptability, treatment adherence, depression, hopelessness, general functioning, social functioning, suicidal ideation, and suicide. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently selected trials, extracted data, and appraised trial quality. For binary outcomes, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence internals (CIs). For continuous outcomes we calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI. The overall certainty of evidence for the primary outcome (i.e. repetition of SH at post‐intervention) was appraised for each intervention using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included data from seven trials with a total of 574 participants. Participants in these trials were predominately female (63.5%) with a mean age of 35.3 years (standard deviation (SD) 3.1 years). It is uncertain if newer generation antidepressants reduce repetition of SH compared to placebo (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.19; N = 129; k = 2; very low‐certainty evidence). There may be a lower rate of SH repetition for antipsychotics (21%) as compared to placebo (75%) (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.50; N = 30; k = 1; low‐certainty evidence). However, there was no evidence of a difference between antipsychotics compared to another comparator drug/dose for repetition of SH (OR 1.51, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.58; N = 53; k = 1; low‐certainty evidence). There was also no evidence of a difference for mood stabilisers compared to placebo for repetition of SH (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.95; N = 167; k = 1; very low‐certainty evidence), or for natural products compared to placebo for repetition of SH (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.38 to 4.62; N = 49; k = 1; lo‐ certainty) evidence. 
Authors' conclusions
Given the low or very low quality of the available evidence, and the small number of trials identified, there is only uncertain evidence regarding pharmacological interventions in patients who engage in SH. More and larger trials of pharmacotherapy are required, preferably using newer agents. These might include evaluation of newer atypical antipsychotics. Further work should also include evaluation of adverse effects of pharmacological agents. Other research could include evaluation of combined pharmacotherapy and psychological treatment.

Do Medicines Help People Who Self-Harm? A Review of Past Studies

### **Rationale**

Self-harm is when a person hurts themself on purpose. It is a serious problem for many people. It can happen more than once. Sometimes, it is linked to suicide, which is when a person ends their own life.

Doctors want to find the best ways to help people who self-harm. We have some information on how talk therapy can help. But we know less about how medicines or natural products can help. We need to know if these treatments are safe and if they work.

This study looked at past research. The goal was to bring together all the information we have. Researchers wanted to see if any medicines or natural products can stop people from self-harming again. This research is needed because there is not a lot of clear information for doctors and patients.

### **Trial Design**

The researchers did not do a new study with new patients. Instead, they looked for all the best studies that had already been done. They only looked at a special type of study. These studies are called randomized controlled trials.

In these studies, people are put into groups by chance. One group gets a real medicine. The other group gets a fake medicine, like a sugar pill. This is the best way to see if a medicine really works.

The researchers found 7 studies to look at. In total, these studies included 574 people. Most of the people were women. Their average age was about 35 years old. All of them had self-harmed in the last 6 months. The studies watched people for up to 2 years to see if they self-harmed again.

### **Results**

Overall, the researchers did not find strong proof that any medicine helps stop self-harm. The studies they found were small. The quality of the proof was low. This means we cannot be very sure about the results.

The researchers looked at a few types of medicines:

*   **Newer depression medicines:** They could not tell if these medicines helped stop self-harm. The proof was not strong enough to be sure.

*   **Antipsychotic medicines:** For this type of medicine, there was a small sign of a benefit. One small study found that people taking this medicine were less likely to self-harm again compared to those taking a sugar pill. About 2 out of 10 people on the medicine self-harmed again. For the sugar pill group, about 7 out of 10 people self-harmed again. But this was from one small study, so the proof is still not very strong.

*   **Mood stabilizers and natural products:** For these treatments, there was no proof that they helped stop self-harm.

The main conclusion is that we need more and better research. Right now, we cannot say for sure if medicines are a good treatment for people who self-harm. Future studies should be larger. They should include more people. They should also look at the side effects of medicines. It might also be helpful to study if using medicines together with talk therapy works better.","Drugs and natural products for self‐harm in adults
We have reviewed the international literature regarding pharmacological (drug) and natural product (dietary supplementation) treatment trials in the field. A total of seven trials meeting our inclusion criteria were identified. There is little evidence of beneficial effects of either pharmacological or natural product treatments. However, few trials have been conducted and those that have are small, meaning that possible beneficial effects of some therapies cannot be ruled out. 
Why is this review important? 
Self‐harm (SH), which includes intentional self‐poisoning/overdose and self‐injury, is a major problem in many countries and is strongly linked with suicide. It is therefore important that effective treatments for SH patients are developed. Whilst there has been an increase in the use of psychosocial interventions for SH in adults (which is the focus of a separate review), drug treatments are frequently used in clinical practice. It is therefore important to assess the evidence for their effectiveness. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
Hospital administrators (e.g. service providers), health policy officers and third party payers (e.g. health insurers), clinicians working with patients who engage in SH, patients themselves, and their relatives. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
This review is an update of a previous Cochrane Review from 2015 which found little evidence of beneficial effects of drug treatments on repetition of SH. This updated aims to further evaluate the evidence for effectiveness of drugs and natural products for patients who engage in SH with a broader range of outcomes. 
Which studies were included in the review? 
To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials of drug treatments for adults who had recently engaged in SH. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
There is currently no clear evidence for the effectiveness of antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, or natural products in preventing repetition of SH. 
What should happen next? 
We recommend further trials of drugs for SH patients, possibly in combination with psychological treatment.

Review question 
Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence about the effect of timed intercourse versus spontaneous intercourse in couples trying to conceive. 
Background 
Many couples find it difficult to achieve a pregnancy and have concerns about their fertility. Each cycle, a woman is fertile from approximately five days before ovulation until several hours after ovulation, due to limited survival times of the sperm and egg. Therefore, prospectively identifying this fertile period of a woman's menstrual cycle, to guide timing of intercourse, may improve conception rates. This may reduce unnecessary medical treatment and costs of advanced infertility treatment, but could also cause adverse events such as stress. The fertile period can be identified by different methods including urinary fertility monitoring, calendar charting, observing changes in cervical mucous and basal body temperatures or follicular maturation on ultrasound. The aim of this review was to assess the benefits and risks of timed intercourse on pregnancy outcomes in couples trying to conceive. 
Study characteristics 
We found five randomised controlled trials comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction, in a total of 2840 women or couples trying to conceive. The evidence was current to August 2014. 
Key results 
One large included study (1453 women) has not published usable results and could therefore not be analysed. One study reported live birth rates and found no evidence of a difference; however, the study was too small to have any clinical value. Only one study reported levels of stress and showed no evidence of a difference between timed intercourse with urinary fertility monitoring and intercourse without urinary fertility monitoring. No other adverse events were reported. Only two studies reported clinical pregnancy rates, and showed no evidence of a difference in pregnancy rates in couples with subfertility. The evidence suggested that if the chance of a clinical pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction was assumed to be 16%, the chance of a clinical pregnancy following timed intercourse would be between 9% and 33%. However, if including self‐reported pregnancies (not confirmed by ultrasound), pregnancy rates were higher after timed intercourse. The evidence suggested that if the chance of a pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction was 13%, the chance following timed intercourse would be between 14% and 23%. 
No difference in effect was found between couples trying to conceive for less than 12 months versus 12 months or more. One trial reported time to conception data and showed no evidence of a difference in time to conception. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low for all outcomes. The main limitations of the evidence were imprecision, poor reporting of clinically relevant outcomes and a high risk of publication bias, as one large study remains unpublished. Therefore, the findings should be regarded with caution.

Does Timing When You Have Sex Help You Get Pregnant?

### **Rationale**

**Why did we do this study?**

Many couples who want to have a baby find it hard to get pregnant. This can be a source of worry and stress. Learning more about what helps people get pregnant is very important.

Each month, there are only a few days when a woman can get pregnant. This is called the ""fertile window."" This window is open for about six days. It starts about five days before a woman's body releases an egg and ends a few hours after.

This study looked at whether planning to have sex during this fertile window can help couples get pregnant. Researchers wanted to know if this method works. If it does, it could help couples avoid other treatments that can be costly and difficult. Researchers also wanted to see if planning sex could cause any problems, like making couples feel stressed.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of other studies that had already been done. This type of study is called a review. It helps to bring all the information on a topic together in one place.

The researchers found five studies to include in their review. In these studies, couples who were trying to have a baby were put into one of two groups by chance. This is a fair way to compare different approaches.

One group of couples used methods to find out when the woman’s fertile window was. These methods can include checking body temperature or using urine tests. They then planned to have sex during these fertile days. The other group of couples had sex whenever they wanted, without any special timing.

In total, the five studies included 2,840 women or couples who were all trying to have a baby.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The researchers found that it is still not clear if timing sex helps couples get pregnant. The main reason for this is that one of the largest studies did not share its results. Without that information, it is very hard to have a clear and full picture.

**Babies born and stress levels**
One small study looked at how many babies were born in each group. It found no difference between the couples who timed sex and those who did not. But the study was too small to give a sure answer. Only one study looked at stress levels. It found no difference in stress between the two groups. No other bad effects were reported.

**Pregnancy rates**
Some studies looked at pregnancies that were confirmed by a doctor’s scan. They found no clear proof that timing sex helped. The results showed that if 16 out of 100 couples got pregnant without timing sex, then for those who did time sex, somewhere between 9 and 33 out of 100 got pregnant. This is a very wide range, which means we cannot be sure if it helps, hurts, or makes no difference.

When looking at all pregnancies, including those that women reported themselves without a doctor's scan, timing sex seemed to help a little. The results showed that if 13 out of 100 couples got pregnant without timing sex, then between 14 and 23 out of 100 couples who timed sex got pregnant.

**Conclusions from the researchers**
The researchers concluded that the quality of the information we have is low. This is because the results were not very exact, and a large study was missing from the review. Because of these problems, we should be very careful when looking at these results. More and better research is needed to know for sure if timing sex is a good way to help couples get pregnant.","Timed intercourse for couples with subfertility

10.1002-14651858.CD013497.pub2,"Background
GM‐CSF (granulocyte macrophage colony‐stimulating factor) is a growth factor that is used to supplement culture media in an effort to improve clinical outcomes for those undergoing assisted reproduction. It is worth noting that the use of GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media often adds a further cost to the price of an in vitro fertilisation (IVF) cycle. The purpose of this review was to assess the available evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the effectiveness and safety of GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of GM‐CSF‐supplemented human embryo culture media versus culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF, in women or couples undergoing assisted reproduction. 
Search methods
We used standard methodology recommended by Cochrane. We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, DARE, OpenGrey, PubMed, Google Scholar, and two trials registers on 15 October 2019, checked references of relevant papers and communicated with experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing GM‐CSF (including G‐CSF (granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor))‐supplemented embryo culture media versus any other non‐GM‐CSF‐supplemented embryo culture media (control) in women undergoing assisted reproduction. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. The primary review outcomes were live birth and miscarriage rate. The secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, multiple gestation, preterm birth, birth defects, aneuploidy, and stillbirth rates. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE methodology. We undertook one comparison, GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media versus culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF, for those undergoing assisted reproduction. 
Main results
We included five studies, the data for three of which (1532 participants) were meta‐analysed. We are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media makes any difference to the live‐birth rate when compared to using conventional culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF (odds ratio (OR) 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.52, 2 RCTs, N = 1432, I2 = 69%, low‐quality evidence). The evidence suggests that if the rate of live birth associated with conventional culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF was 22%, the rate with the use of GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media would be between 21% and 30%. 
We are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media makes any difference to the miscarriage rate when compared to using conventional culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.36, 2 RCTs, N = 1432, I2 = 0%, low‐quality evidence). This evidence suggests that if the miscarriage rate associated with conventional culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF was 4%, the rate with the use of GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media would be between 2% and 5%. 
Furthermore, we are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media makes any difference to the following outcomes: clinical pregnancy (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.45, 3 RCTs, N = 1532 women, I2 = 67%, low‐quality evidence); multiple gestation (OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.10, 2 RCTs, N = 1432, I2 = 35%, very low‐quality evidence); preterm birth (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.04, 2 RCTs, N = 1432, I2 = 76%, very low‐quality evidence); birth defects (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.59 to 3.01, I2 = 0%, 2 RCTs, N = 1432, low‐quality evidence); and aneuploidy (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.26, I2 = 0%, 2 RCTs, N = 1432, low‐quality evidence). We were unable to undertake analysis of stillbirth, as there were no events in either arm of the two studies that assessed this outcome. 
Authors' conclusions
Due to the very low to low quality of the evidence, we cannot be certain whether GM‐CSF is any more or less effective than culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF for clinical outcomes that reflect effectiveness and safety. It is important that independent information on the available evidence is made accessible to those considering using GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media. The claims from marketing information that GM‐CSF has a positive effect on pregnancy rates are not supported by the available evidence presented here; further well‐designed, properly powered RCTs are needed to lend certainty to the evidence.

Does a Special Liquid Help Embryos Grow Better for IVF?

**Rationale**
Many people need medical help to have a baby. One type of help is called in vitro fertilization, or IVF. In IVF, a doctor takes an egg from a woman and sperm from a man. They are joined in a lab to make an embryo. An embryo is the very first stage of a baby.

The embryo grows in a lab for a few days. It grows in a special liquid. This liquid gives the embryo all the food it needs. Some clinics add a substance to this liquid. The substance is called GM-CSF. GM-CSF is a ""growth factor,"" which means it helps cells grow.

The hope is that adding GM-CSF to the liquid will help the embryo grow stronger. This might make it more likely that a person will get pregnant and have a healthy baby. But, using the liquid with GM-CSF costs more money. We need to know if it really works and if it is safe. Researchers did this study to look at all the proof available. They wanted to see if using GM-CSF in the liquid is better than using the normal liquid.

**Trial Design**
This was not a new medical study. Instead, the researchers looked for all the best studies that had already been done on this topic. They looked for a specific type of study called a randomized controlled trial. In these studies, people are put into groups by chance. This is the fairest way to compare treatments.

The researchers found five studies to look at. They combined the results from three of those studies. In total, these studies included 1532 women or couples who were using medical help to have a baby.

In each study, there were two groups. One group of people had their embryos grown in the special liquid with GM-CSF added. The other group had their embryos grown in the normal liquid, without GM-CSF. The researchers then compared what happened to the people in both groups.

**Results**
The researchers first wanted to know if the GM-CSF liquid helped more people have a live baby. After looking at the studies, the researchers were not sure if the GM-CSF liquid made any difference. The proof from the studies was not very strong.

Here is what the numbers showed. If 22 out of 100 people had a baby using the normal liquid, then between 21 and 30 out of 100 people would have a baby using the GM-CSF liquid. This range is wide and includes the chance that there is no benefit at all.

The researchers also looked at the risk of miscarriage. A miscarriage is when a pregnancy ends on its own. They were also not sure if the GM-CSF liquid changed the risk of miscarriage. The proof was again not strong. If 4 out of 100 people had a miscarriage with the normal liquid, then between 2 and 5 out of 100 people would have a miscarriage with the GM-CSF liquid.

The team looked at other things too. These included the chance of getting pregnant, having twins or triplets, the baby being born too early, or the baby having birth defects. For all of these things, the researchers could not be sure if the GM-CSF liquid made any difference. The quality of the proof was low or very low.

Based on all the studies they looked at, the researchers made a conclusion. They said we cannot be certain if the GM-CSF liquid is helpful or safe. The proof we have today does not support the claims that it helps people get pregnant. The researchers believe that new and better studies are needed to get a clear answer. This is important for people to know when they are deciding whether to pay for this extra treatment.","Growth factor‐supplemented culture media for women undergoing assisted reproduction
Review question 
Does culture media containing the growth factor GM‐CSF (granulocyte macrophage colony‐stimulating factor) improve the chances of a pregnancy and live‐born baby, and reduce the risk of miscarriage, twin or triplet pregnancy, premature birth, birth defects, genetic problems in the baby, and stillbirth? 
Background 
Assisted reproduction includes processes whereby a woman's eggs and a man's sperm are combined to achieve fertilisation outside of the body. Embryos are placed in a solution called culture medium to support the growing embryo until it can be replaced into the woman's uterus. Culture medium supplemented with GM‐CSF is widely available in clinics and is often offered as an 'add‐on' to an in vitro fertilisation (IVF) cycle in an effort to improve the success rates of treatment. Using GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture medium can make IVF more expensive. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to October 2019. We obtained data from three randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) of 1532 infertile women undergoing IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), a specialised form of IVF whereby the sperm is injected into the egg. We compared GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media versus culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF for those undergoing assisted reproduction. 
What the review found 
Low‐quality evidence reveals that we are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐containing culture media makes any difference to the live‐birth rate when compared to using culture media not containing GM‐CSF. This suggests that if the rate of live birth associated with culture media not containing GM‐CSF is 22%, the rate with the use of GM‐CSF‐containing culture media would be between 21% and 30%. Low‐quality evidence also reveals that we are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐containing culture media makes any difference to miscarriage when compared to using culture media not containing GM‐CSF. This suggests that if the miscarriage rate associated with culture media not containing GM‐CSF is 4%, the rate with the use of GM‐CSF‐containing culture media would be between 2% and 5%. Low‐quality evidence for pregnancy, birth defects, and genetic problems with the baby, and very low‐quality evidence for twin or triplet pregnancies, and premature birth, reveals that we are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐containing culture media makes any difference to these outcomes when compared to culture media not containing GM‐CSF. Two studies looked at stillbirth, but as no stillbirths occurred in either study, we were unable to analyse this outcome. 
Overall conclusions 
Due to the very low to low quality of the evidence, we cannot be certain whether GM‐CSF is any more or less effective or harmful than culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF. It is important that independent information on the available evidence is made accessible to those considering using GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media. In the meantime, more large studies are needed to increase the certainty of our conclusions.

Smoking is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD), particularly coronary heart disease (CHD). However, quitting smoking may prevent secondary CVD events in people already diagnosed with CHD.  
Objectives
To examine the impact of smoking cessation on death from CVD and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), in people with incident CHD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and the trials registries clinicaltrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We ran all searches from database inception to 15 April 2021.  
Selection criteria
We included cohort studies, and both cluster‐ and individually randomised controlled trials of at least six months' duration. We treated all included studies as cohort studies and analysed them by smoking status at follow‐up. Eligible studies had to recruit adults (> 18 years) with diagnosed CHD and who smoked tobacco at diagnosis, and assess whether they quit or continued smoking during the study. Studies had to measure at least one of our included outcomes with at least six months' follow‐up. Our primary outcomes were death from CVD and MACE. Secondary outcomes included all‐cause mortality, non‐fatal myocardial infarction, non‐fatal stroke, new‐onset angina and change in quality of life.  
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. 
We assessed the risk of bias for the primary outcomes using the ROBINS‐I tool. We compared the incidence of death from CVD and of MACE (primary outcomes) between participants who quit smoking versus those who continued to smoke for each included study that reported these outcomes. We also assessed differences in all‐cause mortality, incidence of non‐fatal myocardial infarction, incidence of non‐fatal stroke and new onset angina. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For our outcome, change in quality of life, we calculated the pooled standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI for the difference in change in quality of life from baseline to follow‐up between those who had quit smoking and those who had continued to smoke. For all meta‐analyses we used a generic inverse variance random‐effects model and quantified statistical heterogeneity using the I²statistic. 
We assessed the certainty of evidence for our primary outcomes using the eight GRADE considerations relevant to non‐randomised studies. 
Main results
We included 68 studies, consisting of 80,702 participants.
For both primary outcomes, smoking cessation was associated with a decreased risk compared with continuous smoking: CVD death (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.75; I² = 62%; 18 studies, 17,982 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and MACE (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.71; I² = 84%; 15 studies, 20,290 participants; low‐certainty evidence). These findings were robust to our planned sensitivity analyses. Through subgroup analysis, for example comparing adjusted versus non‐adjusted estimates, we found no evidence of differences in the effect size. While there was substantial heterogeneity, this was primarily in magnitude rather than the direction of the effect estimates. Overall, we judged 11 (16%) studies to be at moderate risk of bias and 18 (26%) at serious risk, primarily due to possible confounding. There was also some evidence of funnel plot asymmetry for MACE outcomes. For these reasons, we rated our certainty in the estimates for CVD death as moderate and MACE as low.  
For our secondary outcomes, smoking cessation was associated with a decreased risk in all‐cause mortality (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.66; I² = 58%; 48 studies, 59,354 participants), non‐fatal myocardial infarction (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.72; I² = 2%; 24 studies, 23,264 participants) and non‐fatal stroke (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.90; I² = 0%; 9 studies, 11,352 participants). As only one study reported new onset of angina, we did not conduct meta‐analysis, but this study reported a lower risk in people who stopped smoking. Quitting smoking was not associated with a worsening of quality of life and suggested improvement in quality of life, with the lower bound of the CI also consistent with no difference (SMD 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.24; I² = 48%; 8 studies, 3182 participants).  
Authors' conclusions
There is moderate‐certainty evidence that smoking cessation is associated with a reduction of approximately one‐third in the risk of recurrent cardiovascular disease in people who stop smoking at diagnosis. This association may be causal, based on the link between smoking cessation and restoration of endothelial and platelet function, where dysfunction of both can result in increased likelihood of CVD events.  
Our results provide evidence that there is a decreased risk of secondary CVD events in those who quit smoking compared with those who continue, and that there is a suggested improvement in quality of life as a result of quitting smoking. Additional studies that account for confounding, such as use of secondary CVD prevention medication, would strengthen the evidence in this area.

How Quitting Smoking Can Help Your Heart if You Have Heart Disease

### **Rationale**

Smoking is a main cause of serious health problems. It can harm your heart and the blood vessels that carry blood around your body. These problems are called cardiovascular disease, or heart disease for short.

A common type of heart disease is called coronary heart disease. This is when the blood vessels that supply blood to your heart muscle become narrow or blocked. This can be very dangerous and can cause a heart attack.

People who have already been told they have coronary heart disease have a higher risk of future problems. They might have another heart attack or a stroke. Doctors and researchers want to find the best ways to prevent these future problems.

This study looked at one key question. Does quitting smoking help people who already have heart disease? The researchers wanted to see if quitting could lower the chances of dying or having another serious heart or blood vessel problem. This work is important to give clear advice to patients.

### **Trial Design**

This was a special kind of study. The researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they gathered all the best studies that had already been done on this topic. By putting the results of many studies together, they can get a much stronger and more certain answer.

The team looked for studies that met certain rules. The studies had to include adults who were smokers when they were diagnosed with coronary heart disease. The studies then watched these people over time to see who quit smoking and who did not.

Each study had to follow people for at least 6 months. This was to make sure there was enough time to see any health changes. The researchers carefully compared the health of those who quit smoking with those who kept smoking.

The team found 68 studies that fit their rules. In total, these studies included the health information of more than 80,000 people. This large number of people helps make the final results more reliable.

### **Results**

The main results of this large review were very clear. Quitting smoking had big health benefits for people with coronary heart disease.

People who quit smoking had a much lower risk of dying from heart disease. The researchers found their risk was about one-third lower than the risk for people who continued to smoke. They are quite sure about this finding.

Quitting was also linked to a lower risk of having other major heart or blood vessel problems. This includes non-fatal heart attacks and non-fatal strokes. A non-fatal event is one that a person survives. The risk for these serious events was also much lower for people who quit.

The benefits did not stop there. People who quit smoking were also less likely to die from any cause during the studies. On top of these benefits, quitting did not seem to harm a person’s quality of life. The study found that quality of life often improved for those who quit.

The researchers concluded that there is strong evidence that quitting smoking helps. It is a very important step for people with heart disease to take. Quitting smoking can help them live longer and have fewer health problems. They think this is because quitting helps the body heal the blood vessels that were damaged by smoking.","Does stopping smoking make people with heart disease less likely to have another heart attack? 
Key messages 
• People with heart disease who stop smoking are likely to experience a decreased risk in future heart attacks or other events linked to the heart or blood vessels, such as stroke.  
• People with heart disease who stop smoking are unlikely to have worse quality of life. 
Smoking and heart disease 
Smoking increases the chances that a person will have a heart attack, however there is less information on whether stopping smoking can reduce the risk of having a second heart attack.  
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out whether stopping smoking after a heart attack can reduce the chances of having further heart attacks or other types of disease linked to the heart or blood vessels. If stopping smoking does prevent further illness this could motivate more people to quit smoking and encourage doctors and nurses to provide more active support to help people to stop.  
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that lasted at least 6 months, and that included people diagnosed with heart disease who were smoking when the study started. Studies also had to measure whether people did or did not stop smoking and whether or not they had another event linked to their heart or blood vessels, such as another heart attack or a stroke.  
Search date: we included studies published up to 15 April 2021. 
What we found 
We found 68 studies with 80,702 people. Most studies included adult men and women from the general population, however, 11 studies included only men. We looked at the combined results of 60 studies that measured events linked to heart disease and of 8 studies that measured people’s quality of life over a period of 6 months or more.  
What are the results of our review? 
Compared with people who continued to smoke, people who stopped smoking were a third less likely to die from heart disease or stroke (evidence from 17,982 people in 18 studies) and a third less likely to have another heart attack or stroke (evidence from 20,290 people in 15 studies). Our confidence in these results was moderate (death from heart disease or stroke) and low (death from heart disease or stroke, another heart attack or another stroke) respectively. Our confidence in the strength of our results was reduced because of issues with how some of the studies were designed and carried out. However, when we only examined studies of a higher standard, we continued to find that people who stopped smoking were less likely to die from heart disease or stroke. This suggests that while we may be uncertain about how big the reduction in the chance of dying is, people who stop smoking are likely to reduce their chances of dying from heart disease or stroke to some degree. We found similar results for a decreased likelihood of dying from any cause, having another heart attack that does not lead to death and having a stroke that does not lead to death.  
We also found that people who stopped smoking had a suggested improvement in quality of life compared with those who continued smoking after being diagnosed with heart disease.

Stuttering, or stammering as it is referred to in some countries, affects a child's ability to speak fluently. It is a common communication disorder, affecting 11% of children by four years of age. Stuttering can be characterized by sound, part word or whole word repetitions, sound prolongations, or blocking of sounds or airflow. Moments of stuttering can also be accompanied by non‐verbal behaviours, including visible tension in the speaker's face, eye blinks or head nods. Stuttering can also negatively affect behavioural, social and emotional functioning. 
Objectives
Primary objective 
To assess the immediate and long‐term effects of non‐pharmacological interventions for stuttering on speech outcomes, communication attitudes, quality of life and potential adverse effects in children aged six years and younger. 
Secondary objective 
To describe the relationship between intervention effects and participant characteristics (i.e. child age, IQ, severity, sex and time since stuttering onset) at pretest. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, nine other databases and two trial registers on 16 September 2020, and Open Grey on 20 October 2020. There were no limits in regards to language, year of publication or type of publication. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and requested data on unpublished trials from authors of published studies. We handsearched conference proceedings and programmes from relevant conferences. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that assessed non‐pharmacological interventions for stuttering in young children aged six years and younger. Eligible comparators were no intervention, wait list or management as usual. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We identified four eligible RCTs, all of which compared the Lidcombe Program to a wait‐list control group. In total, 151 children aged between two and six years participated in the four included studies. In the Lidcombe Program, the parent and their child visit a speech and language therapist (SLT) in a clinic. One study conducted clinic visits by telephone. In each clinic visit, parents were taught how to conduct treatment at home. Two studies took place in Australia, one in New Zealand and one in Germany. Two studies were conducted for nine months, one for 16 weeks and one for 12 weeks. The frequency of clinic visits and practice sessions at home varied within the programme. One study was partially funded by the Rotary Club, Wiesbaden, Germany; and one was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia. One study did not report funding sources and another reported that they did not receive any funding for the trial.  
All four studies reported the outcome of stuttering frequency. One study also reported on speech efficiency, defined as articulation rate. No studies reported the other predetermined outcomes of this review, namely stuttering severity; communication attitudes; emotional, cognitive or psychosocial domains; or adverse effects.  
The Lidcombe Program resulted in a lower stuttering frequency percentage syllables stuttered (% SS) than a wait‐list control group at post‐test, 12 weeks, 16 weeks and nine months postrandomization (mean difference (MD) −2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) −3.48 to −0.84, 4 studies, 151 participants; P = 0.001; very low‐certainty evidence).  
However, as the Lidcombe Program is designed to take one to two years to complete, none of the participants in these studies had finished the complete intervention programme at any of the data collection points. 
We assessed stuttering frequency to have a high risk of overall bias due to high risk of bias in at least one domain within three of four included studies, and to have some concern of overall bias in the fourth, due to some concern in at least one domain. 
We found moderate‐certainty evidence from one study showing that the Lidcombe Program may increase speech efficiency in young children. 
Only one study reported outcomes at long‐term follow‐up. The long‐term effect of intervention could not be summarized, as the results for most of the children in the control group were missing. However, a within‐group comparison was performed between the mean % SS at randomization and the mean % SS at the time of extended follow‐up, and showed a significant reduction in frequency of stuttering.  
Authors' conclusions
This systematic review indicates that the Lidcombe Program may result in lower stuttering frequency and higher speech efficiency than a wait‐list control group in children aged up to six years at post‐test. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the very low and moderate certainty of the evidence and the high risk of bias identified in the included studies. Thus, there is a need for further studies from independent researchers, to evaluate the immediate and long‐term effects of other non‐pharmacological interventions for stuttering compared to no intervention or a wait‐list control group.

### **Plain Title**

A Review of Speech Treatments for Young Children Who Stutter

### **Rationale**

**What is stuttering and why is it a problem?**

Stuttering is a condition that makes it hard for a child to speak smoothly. A child who stutters might repeat sounds or words. They might also stretch out sounds or get stuck, unable to make any sound at all. Sometimes, you can see them blinking their eyes or tensing their face when they try to talk.

Stuttering is common in young children. About 1 in 10 children may stutter by the time they are four years old. Stuttering can make children feel sad, worried, or shy. It can make it hard for them to make friends or talk in class.

**Why was this study done?**

Researchers wanted to find the best ways to help young children who stutter. They looked for treatments that do not use medicine. They wanted to know if these treatments help children speak more easily. They also wanted to see if the treatments improved a child’s confidence and quality of life. This study was needed to bring together all the research to see what works.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, the researchers looked for all the best studies that had already been done on this topic. This is called a review.

The researchers looked for a special type of study called a randomized controlled trial. In these studies, children are put into different groups by chance. One group gets a treatment. The other group is a ""control group"" that does not get the treatment right away. This helps researchers see if the treatment really works.

**Who was in the studies?**

The review included four different studies. A total of 151 children who stuttered were in these studies. The children were between two and six years old.

**What treatment was studied?**

All four studies looked at the same treatment, called the Lidcombe Program. In this program, a parent and their child meet with a speech expert. The expert teaches the parent how to help their child with speech at home every day. The studies lasted for a few months.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The review found that the Lidcombe Program may help young children who stutter.

*   Children who received the Lidcombe Program seemed to stutter less than children who were on a waiting list for treatment.
*   The treatment may also help children speak more smoothly and at a more normal speed.

**Are these results certain?**

The researchers said we should be careful when looking at these results. This is because:

*   **The evidence is not very strong.** The researchers were not very confident in the results.
*   **There were some problems** in how the original studies were done. This could make the results less trustworthy.
*   **The treatment was not finished.** The full Lidcombe Program takes about one to two years to complete. In these studies, none of the children had finished the full program.
*   **We do not know the long-term effects.** Only one study checked on the children a long time after the treatment. This means we do not know if the benefits of the treatment last over time.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

The Lidcombe Program may help reduce how often a young child stutters. However, we cannot be sure because the evidence we have is weak.

More and better studies are needed. These new studies should be done by researchers who are not connected to the treatment program. They should also study other types of speech treatments. This will help us learn for sure what is the best way to help young children who stutter.","Medicine‐free treatment for stuttering in children aged six years and younger
What was the aim of this review? 
The aim of this review was to find out if medicine‐free treatment for stuttering can improve speech fluency, children's communication attitudes and the impact on the child's quality of life, and potential harmful effects in children aged six years and younger, both in the short‐ and long‐term. We collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer this question and found four studies. 
Key messages 
The Lidcombe Program may result in lower stuttering frequency and higher speech efficiency (i.e. number of words or syllables spoken per minute) for young children after receiving the amount of treatment included in the studies. We do not yet know the impact of the programme delivered in its entirety, as no study reported outcomes for children who had completed the programme, which is designed to last for one to two years. 
Only one study reported how treatment worked in the long run, but the effect of treatment could not be summarized, as the results for most children in the control group were missing. 
We require more high‐quality studies assessing stuttering treatments for young children, including studies that report on a broader range of outcomes and that assess treatments other than the Lidcombe Program. 
What did the review study? 
Stuttering, or stammering as it is sometimes called, is a common communication disorder, that usually begins when children are between two and four years of age. Stuttering can be characterized by repetitions of individual speech sounds, parts of words or whole words; involuntary lengthening of speech sounds; or speech blockages. Moments of stuttering can also be accompanied by visible tension in the speaker's face or voice, eye blinks or head nods. Stuttering can have a negative effect on how people feel about themselves and how they live their lives. Therefore, it is important to identify effective treatments for stuttering in young children to reduce the chance that they will experience these negative effects. 
What were the main results of the review?  
We found four studies, all of which compared young children who received the Lidcombe Program to young children on a wait‐list. In three studies, the children on the wait‐list did not receive any treatment until after the study was finished. In the fourth, the children on the wait‐list could receive treatment from their local speech language therapist (SLT) if they wanted to. At the end of the study, parents of seven children (35%) in the control group reported their child had received some treatment, either the Lidcombe Program or another treatment programme called ""Easy Does It"", while on the wait‐list. 
There were 151 children aged between two and six years in the four studies. In the Lidcombe Program, an SLT conducted clinic visits with the child and parent in person in a clinic or spoke to them by telephone. During these visits, parents were taught to conduct treatment at home during 10‐ to 15‐minute daily practice sessions. Two studies were conducted in Australia, one in New Zealand and one in Germany. Two studies were conducted for nine months, one for 16 weeks and one for 12 weeks. One study was partially funded by the Rotary Club, Wiesbaden, Germany; and one was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia. One study did not report any funding sources and another reported that they did not receive any funding for the trial. 
All four studies reported the effects of treatment on stuttering frequency. One study also reported on speech efficiency. We found no studies that looked at the effects of treatments for stuttering on stuttering severity; communication attitudes; emotional (how a child recognizes, expresses, and manages feelings), cognitive (how a child thinks, explores and works problems out) or psychosocial (how a child's individual needs link to the needs or demands of society) development; or side effects. 
The included studies suggest that the Lidcombe Program may reduce stuttering frequency in young children compared to a wait‐list control group (very low‐quality evidence). One study also reported that the Lidcombe Program may increase speech efficiency in young children compared to a wait‐list control group (moderate‐quality evidence). 
Only one study followed the children up to five years after treatment started, and at that time the results for most of the children in the control group were missing. Therefore, we do not know if the benefits of the treatment lasted over time. 
How up‐to‐date was this review? 
We searched for studies that had been published up to 16 September 2020. One additional database was searched on 20 October 2020.  
How reliable was the evidence generated by this review? 
The quality of the results related to stuttering frequency was very low and the results related to speech efficiency was moderate. This means that we are uncertain that the treatment effect would stay the same if we added more studies to the review. More studies comparing different treatments for stuttering to a wait‐list control group are needed to know the effect of treatment for stuttering with greater certainty.

10.1002-14651858.CD007726.pub3,"Stopping or continuing long‐term antipsychotic drug use for behavioural and psychological symptoms in older people with dementia 
Review question 
We investigated the effects of stopping antipsychotic drugs in older people with dementia who had been taking them for three months or longer. 
Background 
People with dementia may have symptoms and behavioural problems that can be distressing and difficult for carers to manage. Such symptoms (often described as neuropsychiatric symptoms, or NPS) include anxiety, apathy, depression, psychosis (hallucinations and delusions), wandering, repeating words or sounds, shouting, and behaving in agitated or aggressive ways, or both. 
Antipsychotic drugs are often prescribed with the aim of controlling these symptoms and behaviours, although most current guidance suggests these drugs should only be used for short periods of time for the most challenging behaviours. This is largely because these drugs are thought to have risks of side effects (including some that are serious), and because many behavioural problems improve without treatment. However, many people with dementia continue to take antipsychotic drugs over long periods of time. 
This review investigated whether it is feasible for older people with dementia and NPS to stop antipsychotic drugs which they have been taking for at least three months. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2013. 
Methods 
We searched up to 11 January 2018 for any study that randomly allocated some people with dementia who were taking antipsychotic drugs to continue this treatment and others to stop taking antipsychotic drugs. Study participants were followed up over a period of time to see what happened. 
Results 
We included 10 studies with a total of 632 participants in our review. We added one new study with 19 participants for this update. Most participants lived in nursing homes. The studies varied considerably with regard to the people they included, the methods they used and the outcomes they measured. 
Because the studies were so diverse, it was not possible to combine all the data numerically. We found low‐quality evidence that older people with dementia may be able to stop long‐term antipsychotics without their behavioural problems getting worse. However, in some people who had psychosis, agitation or aggression and who had improved significantly when they first started antipsychotic treatment, we found that stopping the drugs may increase the risk of the behavioural problems getting worse again. On the other hand, agitation decreased after stopping the drugs in some participants whose NPS at the beginning of the studies was relatively mild. 
We did not find enough evidence to know whether stopping antipsychotics has beneficial effects on quality of life, thinking and remembering, or the ability to carry out daily tasks, nor if the risk of harmful events ‐ such as falls ‐ is reduced. We are uncertain whether stopping antipsychotics leads to people living longer. 
Quality of the evidence 
Overall, evidence was low‐ or very low‐quality. This means we have limited or little confidence in the results, and that it is possible that other similar research could find something different. The main reasons for this assessment were that there were few studies that included few people, and a risk that results were not fully reported. All included studies had problems recruiting enough participants, making it more difficult for them to detect effects of stopping antipsychotics. 
Conclusions 
Limited evidence suggests that stopping long‐term antipsychotic drug use in older people with dementia and NPS may be done without making their behaviour worse. There may be benefits especially for those with milder NPS. There may be people with more severe symptoms who benefit from continuing treatment, but more research in people with both milder and more severe NPS is needed to be sure about this. The overall conclusions have not changed since the last version of this review and the number of included trials is still low.

### **Plain Title**

Should Older People with Dementia Stop or Keep Taking Medicines for Behavior Problems?

### **Rationale**

**What is dementia and why can it be hard?**

Dementia is a health problem that affects how the brain works. It can make it hard for people to remember things, think clearly, and take care of themselves.

Sometimes, people with dementia can also have behavior problems. They might feel sad, worried, or upset. They might see or hear things that are not there. Some may walk around a lot, shout, or get angry easily. These changes can be very hard for the person with dementia and for their families.

**How are these behavior problems treated?**

Doctors may give special medicines to help with these behavior problems. These are called antipsychotic drugs. But these drugs can have bad side effects. Some side effects can be very serious.

Because of these risks, experts say these drugs should only be used for a short time. They should only be for the most difficult behavior problems. Yet, many older people with dementia take these drugs for a long time.

**Why was this study done?**

Researchers wanted to know what happens when older people with dementia stop taking these drugs. They wanted to see if it was safe to stop after taking them for 3 months or more. They looked to see if the behavior problems came back or got worse.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with new people. Instead, researchers looked at the results from 10 older studies. This is called a review. A review helps us see what many studies found when they are all looked at together.

In those 10 studies, researchers put people into two groups by chance.
*   One group of people stopped taking their medicine for behavior problems. They may have been given a sugar pill, also called a placebo, instead.
*   The other group of people kept taking their medicine as usual.

Doctors then watched both groups for a period of time. They checked to see if the behavior problems got better, stayed the same, or got worse.

**Who was in the studies?**

The 10 studies included a total of 632 older adults. All of them had dementia and had been taking a medicine for behavior problems for 3 months or longer. Most of these people lived in nursing homes.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The proof from these studies was not very strong. This is because the studies were small and were done in different ways. This makes it hard to be sure about the results.

Here is what the researchers found:
*   For many people, it seemed possible to stop taking the medicine. Their behavior problems did not get worse.
*   Some people who had less severe behavior problems actually got better after stopping the medicine. For example, they felt less upset or agitated.
*   But for some people, stopping the drug was not a good idea. These were people who had very bad behavior problems before they started the drug. When they stopped the drug, their problems were more likely to come back.

**Did stopping the medicine have other effects?**

The researchers did not find enough information to answer other questions. They could not tell if stopping the medicine helped people think more clearly or do daily tasks better. They also did not know if it lowered the risk of falls or helped people live longer.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

The researchers concluded that it may be safe for some older people with dementia to stop these long-term medicines. This seems especially true for people whose behavior problems are not very severe.

But for people with more serious behavior problems, it might be better to keep taking the medicine. More and better research is needed to be sure about who should stop and who should continue.","Stopping or continuing long‐term antipsychotic drug use for behavioural and psychological symptoms in older people with dementia

10.1002-14651858.CD013693.pub2,"Background
Globally, children under 15 years represent approximately 12% of new tuberculosis cases, but 16% of the estimated 1.4 million deaths. This higher share of mortality highlights the urgent need to develop strategies to improve case detection in this age group and identify children without tuberculosis disease who should be considered for tuberculosis preventive treatment. One such strategy is systematic screening for tuberculosis in high‐risk groups. 
Objectives
To estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the presence of one or more tuberculosis symptoms, or symptom combinations; chest radiography (CXR); Xpert MTB/RIF; Xpert Ultra; and combinations of these as screening tests for detecting active pulmonary childhood tuberculosis in the following groups. 
– Tuberculosis contacts, including household contacts, school contacts, and other close contacts of a person with infectious tuberculosis. 
– Children living with HIV.
– Children with pneumonia.
– Other risk groups (e.g. children with a history of previous tuberculosis, malnourished children). 
– Children in the general population in high tuberculosis burden settings.
Search methods
We searched six databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Embase, on 14 February 2020 without language restrictions and contacted researchers in the field. 
Selection criteria
Cross‐sectional and cohort studies where at least 75% of children were aged under 15 years. Studies were eligible if conducted for screening rather than diagnosing tuberculosis. Reference standards were microbiological (MRS) and composite reference standard (CRS), which may incorporate symptoms and CXR. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality using QUADAS‐2. We consolidated symptom screens across included studies into groups that used similar combinations of symptoms as follows: one or more of cough, fever, or poor weight gain and one or more of cough, fever, or decreased playfulness. For combination of symptoms, a positive screen was the presence of one or more than one symptom. 
We used a bivariate model to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and performed analyses separately by reference standard. We assessed certainty of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
Nineteen studies assessed the following screens: one symptom (15 studies, 10,097 participants); combinations of symptoms (12 studies, 29,889 participants); CXR (10 studies, 7146 participants); and Xpert MTB/RIF (2 studies, 787 participants). Several studies assessed more than one screening test. No studies assessed Xpert Ultra. For 16 studies (84%), risk of bias for the reference standard domain was unclear owing to concern about incorporation bias. Across other quality domains, risk of bias was generally low. 
Symptom screen (verified by CRS) 
One or more of cough, fever, or poor weight gain in tuberculosis contacts (4 studies, tuberculosis prevalence 2% to 13%): pooled sensitivity was 89% (95% CI 52% to 98%; 113 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and pooled specificity was 69% (95% CI 51% to 83%; 2582 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 children where 50 have pulmonary tuberculosis, 339 would be screen‐positive, of whom 294 (87%) would not have pulmonary tuberculosis (false positives); 661 would be screen‐negative, of whom five (1%) would have pulmonary tuberculosis (false negatives). 
One or more of cough, fever, or decreased playfulness in children aged under five years, inpatient or outpatient (3 studies, tuberculosis prevalence 3% to 13%): sensitivity ranged from 64% to 76% (106 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and specificity from 37% to 77% (2339 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 children where 50 have pulmonary tuberculosis, 251 to 636 would be screen‐positive, of whom 219 to 598 (87% to 94%) would not have pulmonary tuberculosis; 364 to 749 would be screen‐negative, of whom 12 to 18 (2% to 3%) would have pulmonary tuberculosis. 
One or more of cough, fever, poor weight gain, or tuberculosis close contact (World Health Organization four‐symptom screen) in children living with HIV, outpatient (2 studies, tuberculosis prevalence 3% and 8%): pooled sensitivity was 61% (95% CI 58% to 64%; 1219 screens; moderate‐certainty evidence) and pooled specificity was 94% (95% CI 86% to 98%; 201,916 screens; low‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 symptom screens where 50 of the screens are on children with pulmonary tuberculosis, 88 would be screen‐positive, of which 57 (65%) would be on children who do not have pulmonary tuberculosis; 912 would be screen‐negative, of which 19 (2%) would be on children who have pulmonary tuberculosis. 
CXR (verified by CRS) 
CXR with any abnormality in tuberculosis contacts (8 studies, tuberculosis prevalence 2% to 25%): pooled sensitivity was 87% (95% CI 75% to 93%; 232 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and pooled specificity was 99% (95% CI 68% to 100%; 3281 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 children, where 50 have pulmonary tuberculosis, 63 would be screen‐positive, of whom 19 (30%) would not have pulmonary tuberculosis; 937 would be screen‐negative, of whom 6 (1%) would have pulmonary tuberculosis. 
Xpert MTB/RIF (verified by MRS) 
Xpert MTB/RIF, inpatient or outpatient (2 studies, tuberculosis prevalence 1% and 4%): sensitivity was 43% and 100% (16 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and specificity was 99% and 100% (771 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 children, where 50 have pulmonary tuberculosis, 31 to 69 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 9 to 19 (28% to 29%) would not have pulmonary tuberculosis; 931 to 969 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative, of whom 0 to 28 (0% to 3%) would have tuberculosis. 
Studies often assessed more symptoms than those included in the index test and symptom definitions varied. These differences complicated data aggregation and may have influenced accuracy estimates. Both symptoms and CXR formed part of the CRS (incorporation bias), which may have led to overestimation of sensitivity and specificity. 
Authors' conclusions
We found that in children who are tuberculosis contacts or living with HIV, screening tests using symptoms or CXR may be useful, but our review is limited by design issues with the index test and incorporation bias in the reference standard. 
For Xpert MTB/RIF, we found insufficient evidence regarding screening accuracy.
Prospective evaluations of screening tests for tuberculosis in children will help clarify their use. In the meantime, screening strategies need to be pragmatic to address the persistent gaps in prevention and case detection that exist in resource‐limited settings.

Which Tests Work Best to Find Tuberculosis in Children?

### **Rationale**

Tuberculosis, or TB, is a serious illness. It is caused by germs that most often attack the lungs. Many children get TB each year. Sadly, more children who get TB die from it compared to adults. This is a very big problem.

We need to find better ways to check children for TB. Finding the illness early helps children get the medicine they need to get better. It is also important to find children who are at high risk of getting sick. These children can take medicine to stop them from getting TB in the first place.

This study looked at different ways to screen for TB in children. The goal was to learn how well each screening test works. The researchers wanted to find the best way to help doctors find TB in children who are at high risk.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a study with new patients. Instead, the researchers looked at the results of 19 past studies. They combined the information from these studies to get a better overall picture. This kind of study is called a review.

The studies in this review included children under the age of 15. All the children were at a high risk for getting TB. For example, some children had been near a person with TB. Other children had other health problems, like HIV, which can make it easier to get sick with TB.

Because this was a review of older studies, no new patients took part. The researchers just looked at the information that was already collected in the past.

### **Results**

The researchers looked at a few different screening tests to see how well they found TB in children.

**Checking for Signs of Sickness**
One way to screen for TB is to check if a child has certain signs of sickness. These signs can be a cough, a fever, or not gaining enough weight. This test found most of the children who truly had TB.

However, this test also made a lot of mistakes. It often flagged healthy children as possibly being sick. This means that if 1000 children were screened, the test would find many of the sick kids. But it would also tell almost 300 healthy children that they might be sick. These healthy children would need more tests to know for sure.

**Chest X-rays**
Another screening test is a chest X-ray. A chest X-ray is a picture of the inside of the chest. This test was very good at finding children with TB. It was also very good at correctly identifying children who were healthy.

Chest X-rays made far fewer mistakes than checking for signs of sickness. If 1000 children were screened, a chest X-ray would correctly find most children with TB. It would only incorrectly flag about 19 healthy children.

**A Lab Test Called Xpert**
The researchers also looked at a special lab test called Xpert. But they found there was not enough information from past studies. They could not tell how well the Xpert test works as a screening tool for children.

**What This Means for Patients**
This study shows that chest X-rays may be a good way to screen children for TB. Checking for signs of sickness can also be useful, but it leads to many healthy children needing extra tests. Finding children with TB early means they can start treatment sooner and have a better chance of getting well.

The researchers concluded that both chest X-rays and checking for signs of sickness can be helpful. However, they also found some problems with how the older studies were done. These problems might have made the tests look better than they really are. More and better studies are needed to be sure about the best way to screen children for TB.","Screening tests for active pulmonary tuberculosis in children
Why is improving screening for pulmonary tuberculosis in children important? 
Tuberculosis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Most children who die from tuberculosis are never diagnosed or treated. Screening may be useful to identify children with possible tuberculosis and refer them for further testing. As well, screening could be used to identify children without tuberculosis, who should be considered for preventive treatment. A false‐positive result means that children may undergo unnecessary testing and treatment and may not receive preventive treatment promptly. A false‐negative result means that children have tuberculosis, but may miss further testing to confirm the diagnosis. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To determine the accuracy of screening tests for active pulmonary tuberculosis in children in high‐risk groups, such as children with HIV and close contacts of people with tuberculosis. 
What was studied in this review? 
Screening tests were: one tuberculosis symptom; one or more of a combination of tuberculosis symptoms; the World Health Organization (WHO) four‐symptom screen (one or more of cough, fever, poor weight gain, or tuberculosis contact) in children with HIV, recommended at each healthcare visit; chest radiography (CXR); and Xpert MTB/RIF. 
What are the main results in this review? 
Nineteen studies assessed the following screening tests: one symptom (15 studies, 10,097 participants); more than one symptom (12 studies, 29,889 participants); CXR (10 studies, 7146 participants); and Xpert MTB/RIF (two studies, 787 participants). 
Symptom screening 
For every 1000 children screened, if 50 had tuberculosis according to the reference standard: 
One or more of cough, fever, or poor weight gain in tuberculosis contacts (composite reference standard (CRS) (4 studies) 
– 339 would screen positive, of whom 294 (87%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive). 
– 661 would screen negative, of whom 5 (1%) would have tuberculosis (false negative).
One or more of cough, fever, or decreased playfulness in children under five, inpatient or outpatient (CRS) (3 studies) 
– 251 to 636 would screen positive, of whom 219 to 598 (87% to 94%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive). 
– 364 to 749 would screen negative, of whom 12 to 18 (2% to 3%) would have tuberculosis (false negative). 
One or more of cough, fever, poor weight gain, or tuberculosis close contact (WHO four‐symptom screen) in children with HIV, outpatient (CRS) (2 studies) 
– 88 would screen positive, of which 57 (65%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive).
– 912 would screen negative, of which 19 (2%) would have tuberculosis (false negative).
Abnormal CXR in tuberculosis contacts (CRS) (8 studies) 
– 63 would screen positive, of whom 19 (30%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive).
– 937 would screen negative, of whom 6 (1%) would have tuberculosis (false negative).
Xpert MTB/RIF in children, inpatient or outpatient microbiologic reference standard (MRS) (2 studies) 
– 31 to 69 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 9 to 19 (28% to 29%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive). 
– 931 to 969 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative, of whom 0 to 28 (0% to 3%) would have tuberculosis (false negative). 
How reliable are the results of the studies in this review? 
Diagnosing tuberculosis in children is difficult. This may lead to screening tests appearing more or less accurate than they actually are. For Xpert MTB/RIF, there were few studies and children tested to be confident about results. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Children at risk for pulmonary tuberculosis. Results likely do not apply to children in the general population. Studies mainly took place in countries with a high burden of tuberculosis. 
What are the implications of this review? 
In children who are tuberculosis contacts or living with HIV, screening tests using symptoms or CXR may be useful. However, symptoms and CXR formed part of the reference standard, which may falsely elevate the accuracy of the results. We urgently need better screening tests for tuberculosis in children to better identify children who should be considered for tuberculosis preventive treatment and to increase the timeliness of treatment in those with tuberculosis disease. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
To 14 February 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD013469.pub2,"Background
Abdominal aortic graft infections are a major complication following abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery, with high morbidity and mortality rates. They can be treated surgically or conservatively using medical management. The two most common surgical techniques are in situ replacement of the graft and extra‐anatomical bypass. Medical management most commonly consists of a course of long‐term antibiotics. There is currently no consensus on which intervention (extra‐anatomical bypass, in situ replacement, or medical) is the most effective in managing abdominal aortic graft infections. Whilst in emergency or complex situations such as graft rupture surgical management is the only option, in non‐emergency situations it is often personal preference that influences the clinician's decision‐making. 
Objectives
To assess and compare the effects of surgical and medical interventions for abdominal aortic graft infections. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases and WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 2 December 2019. We also reviewed the bibliographies of the studies identified by the search and contacted specialists in the field and study authors to request information on any possible unpublished data. 
Selection criteria
We aimed to include all randomised controlled trials that used surgical or medical interventions to treat abdominal aortic graft infections. The definitions of abdominal aortic graft infections were accepted as presented in the individual studies, and included secondary infection due to aortoenteric fistula. We excluded studies presenting data on prosthetic graft infections in general, unless data specific to abdominal aortic graft infections could be isolated. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed all studies identified by the search. We planned to independently assess risk of bias of the included trials and to evaluate the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Our main outcomes were overall mortality, amputation, graft re‐infection, overall graft‐related complications, graft‐related mortality, acute limb ischaemia, and re‐intervention. 
Main results
We identified no randomised controlled trials to conduct meta‐analysis.
Authors' conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to draw conclusions to support any treatment over the other. Multicentre clinical trials are required to compare different treatments for the condition.

Looking for the Best Way to Treat Infections After Surgery on the Body's Main Blood Vessel

**Rationale**

**What is this review about?**

The aorta is the main blood vessel that carries blood from your heart to the rest of your body. Sometimes, a weak spot in the aorta can bulge out in the belly area. This is called an abdominal aortic aneurysm. To fix this, doctors often do surgery to put a tube, called a graft, inside the blood vessel. This graft strengthens the aorta.

A serious problem can happen after this surgery. The new graft can get infected. These infections are rare, but they are very dangerous. They can make people very sick and can even cause death.

**Why did we do this review?**

Right now, doctors have a few ways to treat these infections. They can do another surgery to fix the problem. One type of surgery replaces the infected graft with a new one in the same spot. Another type of surgery puts a new graft in a different spot to go around the infection. Doctors can also treat the infection with strong medicines called antibiotics for a long time.

The problem is that doctors do not know which treatment is best. There is no clear guide on what to do. The choice of treatment is often based on what a doctor prefers. This review looked for the best scientific studies to compare these treatments. The goal was to find out which treatment helps patients the most.

**Trial Design**

**How was this review designed?**

This was not a study with new patients. Instead, the researchers looked for studies that were already completed. They wanted to find a special type of study called a ""randomized controlled trial.""

In these types of studies, people are put into different treatment groups by chance. For example, one group might get surgery, and another group might get medicine. Putting people in groups by chance is the fairest way to compare treatments. It helps to show which treatment really works best.

The researchers searched for any of these high-quality studies that looked at adults with an infected aortic graft in their belly. They planned to gather the results from all the studies they found. Then they would combine the results to get a strong answer about which treatment is safest and works best.

**Results**

**What were the main results of this review?**

The researchers carefully looked for studies from all over the world. After a very wide search, they found no studies that matched what they were looking for.

This means there are no high-quality studies that have compared the different treatments for these infections. We still do not have strong proof to say if one treatment is better than another.

**What does this mean for patients?**

Because there is no strong proof, doctors must continue to rely on their own experience to choose a treatment. This review shows that we need more research to help doctors and patients make better decisions.

The researchers concluded that new studies are urgently needed. These new studies should be large and should be done in many different hospitals. They should directly compare surgery with medicine, and the different types of surgery with each other. This is the only way we will learn for sure what the best way is to treat these serious infections and save more lives.","Surgical and medical interventions for abdominal aortic graft infections
Background 
Abdominal aortic graft infections are a serious complication following aortic aneurysm surgery. They can be managed in two ways: either with surgery or medical management. Surgery is currently the mainstay of treatment and is usually performed by two methods, one of which involves removing and replacing the infected graft, and the other bypassing the infected graft. Medical management commonly involves a long‐term course of antibiotics. Medical management avoids the risk of potential complications of surgery, but requires use of antibiotics for several months, or even lifelong. There is currently no agreement on which intervention (surgical or medical) is the most effective in managing abdominal aortic graft infections. In emergency or complex situations such as graft rupture, surgical management is the only option, whilst for those unfit for surgery, medical management is the preferred option. However, in non‐emergency situations, it is often personal preference that influences the healthcare provider's decision‐making. This review aimed to assess and compare the effects of surgical and medical interventions for abdominal aortic graft infections. 
Study characteristics and key results 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) to December 2019. We found no trials that met our inclusion criteria. Hence there is currently insufficient evidence to draw conclusions relating to the effects of surgical and medical interventions for abdominal aortic graft infections. 
Conclusion 
Multicentre randomised controlled trials are required to identify the most effective method of treating aortic graft infection. By doing this, 'gold standard' guidelines can be formulated so that all patients can receive the same level of treatment without regard for where they are being treated.

Checking on Cancer After Treatment: Is Hearing from Patients Better than Hospital Visits?

### **Rationale**

Gynecological cancer is a type of cancer in a woman's reproductive parts. After treatment ends, doctors need to check on patients to make sure the cancer has not come back. This is called follow-up care.

The usual way to do follow-up care is for patients to visit the hospital many times. These regular visits can make patients feel worried and stressed. They can also be costly for the patient and the health care system.

Doctors and patients think there might be a better way. One idea is to use patient reports. This is where patients report on their own health and how they are feeling, often from home. This new way might help patients feel less anxious. But we do not know if it works as well as hospital visits. This review was done to see if past studies could tell us which way is better for women.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a study with new patients. Instead, the researchers looked for studies that had already been done. They did a wide search for studies that compared the two ways of doing follow-up care.

The researchers were looking for a special type of study called a randomized controlled study. This is the best type of study to compare two different approaches.

In these studies, one group of women would have had the usual follow-up care with many hospital visits. The other group of women would have used patient reports to tell doctors about their health. All women in the studies would have been treated for gynecological cancer.

### **Results**

The researchers looked very hard for these types of studies. After their search, they found no studies that compared patient reports with usual hospital visits for follow-up care.

This means that today, we do not have good information to answer the question. We do not know if patient reports are better, worse, or the same as hospital visits for helping women live longer and better. We also do not know if this new way helps patients feel more satisfied with their care.

The researchers who did this review concluded that new studies are needed. Good-quality studies must be done to compare the two kinds of follow-up care. The results from these future studies will help doctors and patients decide on the best way to check on a woman’s health after cancer treatment.","Benefits of patient‐reported measures of health and well‐being versus traditional follow‐up after treatment of gynaecological cancer

10.1002-14651858.CD015085.pub2,"Background
Starting in late 2019, COVID‐19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2, spread around the world. Long‐term care facilities are at particularly high risk of outbreaks, and the burden of morbidity and mortality is very high among residents living in these facilities. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of non‐pharmacological measures implemented in long‐term care facilities to prevent or reduce the transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection among residents, staff, and visitors. 
Search methods
On 22 January 2021, we searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, Web of Science, and CINAHL. 
We also conducted backward citation searches of existing reviews.
Selection criteria
We considered experimental, quasi‐experimental, observational and modelling studies that assessed the effects of the measures implemented in long‐term care facilities to protect residents and staff against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Primary outcomes were infections, hospitalisations and deaths due to COVID‐19, contaminations of and outbreaks in long‐term care facilities, and adverse health effects. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts. One review author performed data extractions, risk of bias assessments and quality appraisals, and at least one other author checked their accuracy. Risk of bias and quality assessments were conducted using the ROBINS‐I tool for cohort and interrupted‐time‐series studies, the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist for case‐control studies, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively, focusing on the direction of effect. One review author assessed certainty of evidence with GRADE, with the author team critically discussing the ratings. 
Main results
We included 11 observational studies and 11 modelling studies in the analysis. All studies were conducted in high‐income countries. 
Most studies compared outcomes in long‐term care facilities that implemented the measures with predicted or observed control scenarios without the measure (but often with baseline infection control measures also in place). Several modelling studies assessed additional comparator scenarios, such as comparing higher with lower rates of testing. 
There were serious concerns regarding risk of bias in almost all observational studies and major or critical concerns regarding the quality of many modelling studies. Most observational studies did not adequately control for confounding. Many modelling studies used inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters of the models, and failed to adequately assess uncertainty. 
Overall, we identified five intervention domains, each including a number of specific measures. 
Entry regulation measures (4 observational studies; 4 modelling studies)Self‐confinement of staff with residents may reduce the number of infections, probability of facility contamination, and number of deaths. Quarantine for new admissions may reduce the number of infections. Testing of new admissions and intensified testing of residents and of staff after holidays may reduce the number of infections, but the evidence is very uncertain. The evidence is very uncertain regarding whether restricting admissions of new residents reduces the number of infections, but the measure may reduce the probability of facility contamination. Visiting restrictions may reduce the number of infections and deaths. Furthermore, it may increase the probability of facility contamination, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is very uncertain how visiting restrictions may adversely affect the mental health of residents. 
Contact‐regulating and transmission‐reducing measures (6 observational studies; 2 modelling studies)Barrier nursing may increase the number of infections and the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Multicomponent cleaning and environmental hygiene measures may reduce the number of infections, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is unclear how contact reduction measures affect the probability of outbreaks. These measures may reduce the number of infections, but the evidence is very uncertain. Personal hygiene measures may reduce the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Mask and personal protective equipment usage may reduce the number of infections, the probability of outbreaks, and the number of deaths, but the evidence is very uncertain. Cohorting residents and staff may reduce the number of infections, although evidence is very uncertain. Multicomponent contact ‐regulating and transmission ‐reducing measures may reduce the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. 
Surveillance measures (2 observational studies; 6 modelling studies)Routine testing of residents and staff independent of symptoms may reduce the number of infections. It may reduce the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Evidence from one observational study suggests that the measure may reduce, while the evidence from one modelling study suggests that it probably reduces hospitalisations. The measure may reduce the number of deaths among residents, but the evidence on deaths among staff is unclear. Symptom‐based surveillance testing may reduce the number of infections and the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. 
Outbreak control measures (4 observational studies; 3 modelling studies)Separating infected and non‐infected residents or staff caring for them may reduce the number of infections. The measure may reduce the probability of outbreaks and may reduce the number of deaths, but the evidence for the latter is very uncertain. Isolation of cases may reduce the number of infections and the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. 
Multicomponent measures (2 observational studies; 1 modelling study)A combination of multiple infection‐control measures, including various combinations of the above categories, may reduce the number of infections and may reduce the number of deaths, but the evidence for the latter is very uncertain. 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides a comprehensive framework and synthesis of a range of non‐pharmacological measures implemented in long‐term care facilities. These may prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infections and their consequences. However, the certainty of evidence is predominantly low to very low, due to the limited availability of evidence and the design and quality of available studies. Therefore, true effects may be substantially different from those reported here. 
Overall, more studies producing stronger evidence on the effects of non‐pharmacological measures are needed, especially in low‐ and middle‐income countries and on possible unintended consequences of these measures. Future research should explore the reasons behind the paucity of evidence to guide pandemic research priority setting in the future.

What helps stop COVID-19 in care homes? A look at safety rules.

### **Rationale**

COVID-19 is an illness caused by a new virus. It started in late 2019 and spread all over the world. People who live in long-term care homes were at a very high risk from this virus.

Many people in these homes got very sick, and many died from COVID-19. This was a great burden for the residents, their families, and the staff who care for them.

Researchers wanted to find out what could be done to protect them. They looked at safety rules that did not involve using any new drugs. They wanted to know if these rules helped stop the virus from spreading in care homes. This study was needed to find the best ways to keep everyone safe.

### **Trial Design**

This was a special type of study. The researchers did not do new tests with patients. Instead, they looked for and studied other research that was already finished. This is called a review.

The researchers searched for studies about safety rules for COVID-19 in care homes. They found and looked at 22 different studies. Some of these studies watched what happened in real care homes when rules were put in place. Other studies used computers and math to guess what might happen.

All of the studies they reviewed were done in wealthy countries. The studies focused on what happened to the residents and staff inside the care homes.

### **Results**

First, the researchers looked closely at how the 22 studies were done. They found that most of the studies had problems in their design. This means we cannot be very sure about their results. The real effects of the safety rules might be different from what the studies found.

The researchers grouped the safety rules into different types to see what they found.

**Rules About Who Can Enter a Care Home**
*   Having staff live inside the care home with residents may have lowered the number of people who got sick.
*   Keeping new residents separate from others for a short time may have also helped.
*   Rules to limit or stop visitors may have lowered the number of sick people. But researchers were not very sure about this. They also did not know if these rules made residents feel more sad or lonely.

**Rules to Stop the Virus from Spreading Inside**
*   Using masks and other safety gear, like gloves and gowns, may have helped a lot. This may have led to fewer people getting sick and fewer deaths.
*   Keeping residents and staff in small, separate groups may have also helped stop the spread. However, the researchers were not very sure about this.

**Rules for Testing and Watching for Sickness**
*   Testing all residents and staff for COVID-19 often seemed to help. This was true even when people did not feel sick.
*   This regular testing may have lowered how many people got sick. It may have also meant that fewer people had to go to the hospital. The testing may have even saved lives.

**Rules for an Outbreak**
*   When someone in a care home got sick, keeping them away from healthy people was important.
*   Also, the staff who cared for sick people should not care for healthy people.
*   These rules may have stopped the virus from spreading more in the home. This may have lowered sickness and deaths.

**Using Many Rules at the Same Time**
*   Many care homes used a mix of these safety rules all at once.
*   Using many rules together may have helped lower the number of people who got sick and died. But again, the researchers were not very sure about this.

**What the Researchers Concluded**
This review brought together all the information about these safety rules. These rules may help protect people in care homes from COVID-19.

But the proof from the studies is not very strong. Because the studies were not designed well, we cannot be sure how much each rule really helps. The true results could be very different.

We need more and better studies to know for sure what works best. Future studies should be done in countries all over the world, not just in wealthy ones. This will help us be better prepared to keep people in care homes safe.","Can non‐medicinal measures prevent or reduce SARS‐CoV‐2 infections in long term care facilities? 
Key messages 
• Non‐medicinal measures (e.g. visiting restrictions or regular testing) may prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (causing COVID‐19 disease) in residents and staff in long term care facilities, but we have concerns about the reliability of the findings. 
• More high‐quality studies on real‐world experiences are needed, in particular.
• More research is also needed on measures in facilities where most residents and staff are vaccinated, as well as regions other than North America and Europe. 
What are non‐medicinal measures? 
Non‐medicinal measures are ways of preventing or reducing disease without using medicine, such as vaccines. These include controlling people's movements and contacts, using personal protective equipment (PPE), or regular testing for infection. 
SARS‐CoV‐2 is very infectious. Elderly or disabled people, who live in care homes (long‐term care facilities), are vulnerable to infection because they live in close contact with other people, with carers and visitors entering and leaving the facility. Due to age and underlying health conditions, care home residents have an increased risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID‐19 and dying from the disease. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out how effective non‐medicinal measures are in preventing residents and staff in long‐term care facilities from becoming infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 and in reducing the spread of the infection. We focused on all types of long‐term care facilities for adults, such as nursing homes for the elderly and skilled nursing facilities for people living with disabilities. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that investigated the effects of non‐medicinal measures in long‐term care facilities. To be included, studies had to report how many infections, hospitalisations or deaths the measures prevented in residents or staff, or whether the measures prevented the introduction of the virus into the facilities or prevented outbreaks within facilities. We included any type of study, including observational studies that used ‘real‐world’ data, or modelling studies based on assumed data from computer‐generated simulations. 
What did we find? 
We found 22 studies, 11 observational and 11 modelling studies. All studies were conducted in North America or Europe. 
There were four main types of measures.
1.Entry regulation measures to prevent residents, staff or visitors introducing the virus into the facility. Measures included staff confining themselves with residents, quarantine for newly‐admitted residents, testing new admissions, not allowing the admission of new residents, and preventing visitors from entering facilities. 
2. Contact‐regulating and transmission‐reducing measures to prevent people passing on the virus. Measures included wearing masks or PPE, social distancing, extra cleaning, reducing contact between residents and among staff, and placing residents and staff in care groups and limiting contact between groups. 
3. Surveillance measures designed to identify an outbreak early. Measures included regular testing of residents or staff regardless of symptoms, and symptom‐based testing. 
4. Outbreak control measures to reduce the consequences of an outbreak. Measures included isolation of infected residents, and separating infected and non‐infected residents or staff caring for them. 
Some studies used a combination of these measures.
Main results 
Entry regulation measures  (4 observational studies; 4 modelling studies) 
Most studies showed that such measures were beneficial, but some studies found no effects or unwanted effects, such as depression and delirium among residents in the context of visiting restrictions. 
Contact‐regulating and transmission‐reducing measures  (6 observational studies; 2 modelling studies) 
Some measures may be beneficial, but often the evidence is very uncertain.
Surveillance measures  (2 observational studies; 6 modelling studies) 
Routine testing of residents and staff may reduce the number of infections, hospitalisations and deaths among residents, although the evidence on the number of deaths among staff was less clear. Testing more often, getting test results faster, and using more accurate tests were predicted to have more beneficial effects. 
Outbreak control measures  (4 observational studies; 3 modelling studies) 
These measures may reduce the number of infections and the risk of outbreaks in facilities, but often the evidence is very uncertain. 
Combination measures  (2 observational studies; 1 modelling study) 
A combination of different measures may be effective in reducing the number of infections and deaths. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in these results is limited. Many studies used mathematical prediction rather than real‐world data, and we cannot be confident that the model assumptions are accurate. Most observational studies did not use the most reliable methods. This means we cannot be confident that the measure caused the effect, for example, that testing of residents reduced the number of deaths. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
This review includes studies published up to 22 January 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013483.pub2,"Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs mostly in people with chronic liver disease. Worldwide, it ranks sixth in terms of incidence of cancer, and fourth in terms of cancer‐related deaths. Contrast‐enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is used as an add‐on test to confirm the presence of focal liver lesions suspected as hepatocellular carcinoma after prior diagnostic tests such as abdominal ultrasound or measurement of alpha‐foetoprotein, or both. According to guidelines, a single contrast‐enhanced imaging investigation, with either computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may show the typical hepatocellular carcinoma hallmarks in people with cirrhosis, which will be sufficient to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma. However, a significant number of hepatocellular carcinomas show atypical imaging features, and therefore, are missed at imaging. 
Dynamic CEUS images are obtained similarly to CT and MRI images. CEUS differentiates between arterial and portal venous phases, in which sonographic hepatocellular carcinoma hallmarks, such as arterial hyperenhancement and subsequent washout appearance, are investigated. The advantages of CEUS over CT and MRI include real‐time imaging, use of contrast agents that do not contain iodine and are not nephrotoxic, and quick image acquisition. Despite the advantages, the use of CEUS in the diagnostic algorithm for HCC remains controversial, with disagreement on relevant guidelines. 
There is no clear evidence of the benefit of surveillance programmes in terms of overall survival as the conflicting results can be a consequence of an inaccurate detection, ineffective treatment, or both. Therefore, assessing the diagnostic accuracy of CEUS may clarify whether the absence of benefit could be related to underdiagnosis. Furthermore, an assessment of the accuracy of CEUS for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma is needed for either diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma or ruling it out in people with chronic liver disease who are not included in surveillance programmes. 
Objectives
1. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of contrast‐enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma of any size and at any stage in adults with chronic liver disease, in a surveillance programme or in a clinical setting. 
2. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of CEUS for the diagnosis of resectable hepatocellular carcinoma in people with chronic liver disease and identify potential sources of heterogeneity in the results. 
Search methods
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The last date of search was 5 November 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of CEUS for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults with chronic liver disease, with cross‐sectional designs, using one of the acceptable reference standards, such as pathology of the explanted liver, and histology of resected or biopsied focal liver lesion with at least a six‐month follow‐up. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods to screen studies, extract data, and assess the risk of bias and applicability concerns, using the QUADAS‐2 checklist. We used the bivariate model and provided estimates of summary sensitivity and specificity. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We presented uncertainty‐of‐the‐accuracy estimates using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
Main results
We included 23 studies with 6546 participants. Studies were published between 2001 and 2021. We judged all 23 studies at high‐risk of bias in at least one domain, and 13/23 studies at high concern for applicability. Most studies used different reference standards to exclude the presence of the target condition. The time interval between the index test and the reference standard was rarely defined. We also had major concerns on their applicability due to the characteristics of the participants. 
– CEUS for hepatocellular carcinoma of any size and stage: sensitivity 77.8% (95% CI 69.4% to 84.4%) and specificity 93.8% (95% CI 89.1% to 96.6%) (23 studies, 6546 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
– CEUS for resectable hepatocellular carcinoma: sensitivity 77.5% (95% CI 62.9% to 87.6%) and specificity 92.7% (95% CI 86.8% to 96.1%) (13 studies, 1257 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
The observed heterogeneity in the results remains unexplained. The sensitivity analyses, including only studies with clearly prespecified positivity criteria and only studies in which the reference standard results were interpreted with no knowledge of the results about the index test, showed no differences in the results. 
Authors' conclusions
We found that by using CEUS, as an add‐on test following abdominal ultrasound, to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma of any size and stage, 22% of people with hepatocellular carcinoma would be missed, and 6% of people without hepatocellular carcinoma would unnecessarily undergo further testing or inappropriate treatment. As to resectable hepatocellular carcinoma, we found that 23% of people with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma would incorrectly be unresected, while 8% of people without hepatocellular carcinoma would undergo further inappropriate testing or treatment. The uncertainty resulting from the high risk of bias of the included studies, heterogeneity, and imprecision of the results and concerns on their applicability limit our ability to draw confident conclusions.

### **How Well Does a Special Ultrasound Scan Find Liver Cancer?**

#### **Why was this study done?**

Hepatocellular carcinoma is a type of liver cancer. It is a serious health problem around the world. It is one of the most common causes of death from cancer. This cancer mostly grows in people who have had liver problems for a long time. This is also called chronic liver disease.

Doctors need good tests to find liver cancer early. They often use scans like CT or MRI to check for it. But these scans are not perfect. Sometimes, the cancer can look different on the scan, which means the scan might miss it. If a cancer is missed, a person cannot get the treatment they need.

This study looked at a different kind of test. It is a special ultrasound called a contrast-enhanced ultrasound, or CEUS. This test uses a special dye that is put into a vein. The dye helps sound waves make a clearer picture of the liver. This can help doctors see if a spot on the liver is cancer.

This special ultrasound has some good points. It shows images right away. The dye it uses is safe for people who have kidney problems. This is not true for the dye used in some other scans. But doctors do not all agree on how good CEUS is at finding liver cancer. This study was needed to get a clearer answer.

#### **How was this study designed?**

This research was a review of past studies. This means the researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they gathered all the studies that had already been done on this topic. This is a way to combine information from many places to get a stronger answer.

The team looked for studies that used the special ultrasound (CEUS) to find liver cancer. The studies had to include adults who had long-term liver disease. The researchers searched for all studies published up to November 2021. They selected 23 studies to include in their final review. Together, these studies had information on 6,546 people.

For a study to be included, it had to compare the special ultrasound results to a sure-fire way of knowing if cancer was there. This is called a ""gold standard."" For this research, the gold standard was looking at a piece of the liver tissue under a microscope after it was removed. This is the only way to be 100% sure if cancer is present.

The researchers used special tools to check the quality of each of the 23 studies. They wanted to see if the studies were done in a way that gave fair and trustworthy results.

#### **What were the main results of the study?**

First, the researchers found that most of the 23 studies they looked at had some problems. The way the studies were done could have led to wrong results. This is called a ""high risk of bias."" Because of this, we must be very careful when we look at the final numbers. The researchers said they have very low confidence in the results.

The team looked at how well the special ultrasound (CEUS) finds liver cancer of any size. The results showed that the test is not perfect.
*   Imagine 100 people who really do have liver cancer. The special ultrasound would correctly find the cancer in about 78 of these people. But it would fail to find the cancer in the other 22 people. These people would be told they do not have cancer when they really do.
*   Now, imagine 100 people who do not have liver cancer. The special ultrasound would correctly say that about 94 of them are cancer-free. But, it would wrongly say that the other 6 people might have cancer. This could lead to worry and more tests for people who are healthy.

The team also looked at how well the test finds liver cancers that can be removed with surgery. Getting this right is very important because surgery can cure the cancer. The results were very similar.
*   Out of 100 people with this type of cancer, the test would miss it in about 23 of them. This means about 23 people could miss out on a life-saving surgery.
*   Out of 100 people without this cancer, the test would raise a false alarm for about 8 of them.

The researchers concluded that we cannot trust these results completely. The studies had too many issues. Using this special ultrasound test could lead to problems. Many cancers could be missed, and some people could get unneeded tests. More research, done in a better way, is needed to know for sure if this test is helpful for finding liver cancer.","How accurate are contrast‐enhanced ultrasound scans for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma?
Key messages 
In adults with chronic liver disease, contrast‐enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can miss diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma in around 22.2% of people who would not then receive timely or appropriate treatment, and would fail to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma in 6.2% of people who could receive unnecessary further testing or treatment. 
In the subset of people who are able have the hepatocellular carcinoma removed by surgery, CEUS probably misses hepatocellular carcinoma in 22.5% of people who could undergo surgery to remove part of their liver while it would erroneously find cancer in 7.3% of people who would undergo unnecessary further test or surgery. 
As there were some problems with the way the studies were conducted, CEUS to detect hepatocellular carcinoma may appear more accurate than it actually is. 
Why is improving the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma important? 
Hepatocellular carcinoma is cancer originating in the liver. It is sixth in terms of occurrences of cancer and fourth in terms of cancer‐related deaths worldwide. It occurs mostly in people with chronic liver disease regardless of the exact cause. People with blood test or ultrasound results that suggest they may have hepatocellular carcinoma may go on to have further tests, such as imaging or a biopsy (where a small piece of the liver is removed and examined). If the cancer is detected early, people may have part of the liver removed or have a liver transplant. In advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, they may need chemotherapy. If hepatocellular carcinoma is missed at diagnostic testing, people will not receive appropriate treatment. However, incorrectly diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma when it is not present means that people may undergo unnecessary testing or treatment. 
What is contrast‐enhanced ultrasound and how can it diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma? 
CEUS can detect abnormalities in the liver that might be due to cancer and, using contrast agents, confirm the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. These contrast agents are safe. CEUS is used in clinical practice to confirm the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma in people in whom suspicion was raised by prior performed abdominal ultrasound or a blood test to measure alpha‐foetoprotein. 
The role of CEUS in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma remains controversial between guidelines. Previous systematic reviews have assessed the performance of CEUS in detecting hepatocellular carcinoma but they have included different studies and found different results. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if CEUS is accurate enough to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma in adults with chronic liver disease (a progressive deterioration of liver functions for more than six months). We were interested first in hepatocellular carcinoma of any size and severity and, second, in hepatocellular carcinomas that were suitable for surgical removal (resection). 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed the accuracy of diagnostic tests of CEUS scans compared to the best available tests to confirm hepatocellular carcinoma in adults with chronic liver disease. The best available test is examination of the liver, or part of it, under a microscope. 
What did we find? 
We found 23 studies with 6546 adults.
Around 690 (69%) out of 1000 adults with chronic liver disease had a confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma of any size and severity. Considering these 1000 people, CEUS: 
– correctly detected liver cancer in 537 people;
– missed liver cancer in 153 people;
– incorrectly detected cancer in 19 people;
– correctly detected no cancer in 291 people.
Around 690 (69%) out of 1000 adults with chronic liver disease had a confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma that could be removed by surgery. Considering these 1000 people, CEUS: 
– correctly detected liver cancer in 535 people;
– missed liver cancer in 155 people;
– incorrectly detected cancer in 23 people;
– correctly detected no cancer in 287 people.
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the evidence is limited as the studies used different methods to select study participants and used different reference standards. This means that CEUS scans may be more or less accurate than what the evidence suggests. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to 5 November 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD011683.pub2,"Targeted mass media interventions to encourage healthier behaviours in adult, ethnic minorities 
Background and review question 
Health authorities and non‐governmental organisations often use mass media interventions (e.g. leaflets, radio and TV advertisements, posters and social media) to encourage healthier behaviours related to physical activity, dietary patterns, tobacco use or alcohol consumption, among others. In this review, we consider the effects of mass media interventions targeted towards ethnic minorities. A targeted intervention is designed for and considers the characteristics of a specific group, ideally providing ethnic minority groups equal opportunities and resources to access information, life skills, and opportunities to make healthier choices. However, we do not know whether targeted mass media strategies are more effective in reaching and influencing ethnic minorities than mass media strategies developed for the general population. 
Study characteristics 
We found six studies, all from the USA, four of which targeted African Americans and two which targeted Latino or Chinese immigrants. Of the studies, four were experimental (1693 volunteers) and two reported the results of large, targeted campaigns run in whole communities and cities. The evidence is current to August 2016. 
Key results 
The available evidence is insufficient to conclude whether targeted mass media interventions for ethnic minority groups are more, less or equally effective in changing health behaviours than general mass media interventions. Only one study compared participants' smoking habits and intentions to quit following the receipt of either a culturally adapted smoking advice booklet or a booklet developed for the general population. They found little or no differences in smoking behaviours between the groups. 
When compared to no mass media intervention, a targeted mass media intervention may increase the number of calls to smoking quit lines, but the effect on health behaviours is unclear. This conclusion is based on findings from three studies. One study gave participants access to a series of 12 live shows on cable TV with information on how to maintain a healthy weight through diet and physical activity. Compared to women who did not watch the shows, participants reported slightly increased physical activity and some positive changes to their dietary patterns; however, their body weight was no different over time. Two other studies were large‐scale targeted campaigns in which smokers were encouraged to call a quit line for smoking cessation advice. The number of telephone calls from the target population increased considerably during the campaign. 
This review also compared targeted mass media interventions versus mass media interventions with added personal interactions. These findings, based on three studies, were inconclusive. 
None of the studies reported whether the interventions could have had any adverse effects, such as possible stigmatisation or increased resistance to messages. 
Further studies directly comparing targeted mass media interventions with general mass media interventions would be useful. Few studies have investigated the effects of targeted mass media interventions for ethnic minority groups who primarily speak a non‐dominant language. 
Quality of the evidence 
Our confidence in the evidence of effect on all main outcomes is low to very low. This means that the true effect may be different or substantially different from the results presented in this review. We have moderate confidence in the estimated increase in the number of calls to smoking quit lines.

Do Special Health Ads Work Better for Ethnic Minorities?

### **Rationale**

Health groups often use TV ads, radio spots, and flyers to help people live healthier lives. These ads suggest things like being more active, eating better food, or stopping smoking.

People from different ethnic groups may have unique cultures, languages, or health needs. Ads made for everyone might not work as well for them. This study wanted to find out if special ads made just for certain ethnic groups work better.

These special ads are called ""targeted"" ads. They are designed to connect with a specific group's culture and background. The main idea was to see if these special ads were better at helping people from ethnic minority groups make healthy changes.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new people. Instead, researchers looked for studies that had already been done. This is called a ""review.""

The researchers found six studies to look at. All of the studies took place in the USA. They included about 1,700 people in total. Some studies also looked at large ad campaigns that ran in whole cities.

The people in the studies were adults from ethnic minority groups. Four studies focused on African Americans. Two other studies focused on people who moved to the USA from Latin America or China. The studies looked at ads about healthy eating, exercise, and how to stop smoking.

### **Results**

The researchers could not say for sure if special ads work better for ethnic minorities than general ads. There was not enough information to make a clear decision. Only one study compared a special stop-smoking booklet to a general one. It found little to no difference in how many people tried to quit smoking.

The study also looked at whether special ads worked better than no ads at all. The results here were also unclear. Three studies showed that a special ad campaign may lead to more people calling a phone line to get help with quitting smoking.

One study had a series of 12 TV shows for women. The shows gave tips on healthy eating and exercise. Women who watched the shows were a bit more active and ate a little better. But their body weight did not change over time.

None of the studies reported any bad effects. For example, they did not check if the special ads made people feel singled out. The researchers believe we need more studies to get a clear answer. They said we cannot be very sure about these results. This means the true effects of these special ads could be different from what this review found.","Targeted mass media interventions to encourage healthier behaviours in adult, ethnic minorities

10.1002-14651858.CD011357.pub2,"Antibiotics for bacterial infection in the urine in kidney transplant recipients when there are no symptoms 
What is the issue? Bacteria in the urine in kidney transplant recipients when there are no symptoms of urine infection is called asymptomatic bacteriuria. Up to one in two people with a kidney transplant will develop a bacterial infection of the urine (bacteriuria) at some point after transplantation. Bacteriuria with symptoms like fever, chills, painful urination, abdominal pain and blood in urine is a urinary tract infection (UTI). Bacteriuria often occurs without symptoms and it is frequently treated with antibiotics with the idea this might help avoid subsequent UTI. Avoiding UTI might improve patient and transplant survival. However, it is unclear how many people with asymptomatic bacteriuria go on to develop UTI symptoms; whether treatment with antibiotics truly avoids UTI; or whether treatment when asymptomatic improves survival of both patient and kidney. Also, there can be downsides to taking antibiotics. Taking regular antibiotics might mean that bacteria resistant to antibiotics are encouraged, and taking antibiotics might cause diarrhoea and other adverse events. There are also antibiotic costs to consider. This review looked at whether treating with antibiotics is beneficial of harmful. 
What did we do? 
We searched the literature up to September 2017 and identified two studies (212 participants) that were evaluated in this review. These studies compared antibiotics versus no treatment. 
What did we find? The bacterial infection of the urine often persisted, whether antibiotics were given or not. It was uncertain whether antibiotics prevented symptomatic urinary infection or increased the risk of selecting bacteria resistant to antibiotics, because there were too few data and several limitations in the included studies. Also, it was unclear whether the use of antibiotics in case of urinary infection without symptoms reduced the risks of graft rejection, need for hospitalisation due to symptoms of urinary infection, or mortality, or whether antibiotics improved the function of the kidney transplant. One study with 112 participants suggested there were no severe harmful reactions caused by the antibiotic treatment, and non‐severe adverse events appeared to be rare. 
Conclusions It is uncertain whether antibiotics are beneficial in kidney transplant recipients with bacteria in their urine but no symptoms. In one study, participants were assigned to antibiotics or no therapy by a method that was not random (i.e. according to patients' transplant code). In both studies, participants knew which treatment they were receiving (i.e. antibiotics or no therapy), which may have influenced the results. Last, we had not enough data to estimate with precision some effects of antibiotics. More research is needed.

Do antibiotic pills help a silent urine infection in people with a new kidney?

**Rationale**

Many people get a new kidney through a transplant surgery. After this surgery, it is common for germs, called bacteria, to get into their urine.

Sometimes, these germs cause a painful urine infection. This is called a urinary tract infection, or UTI. A UTI can make you feel sick. You might have a fever, pain when you pee, or tummy pain.

Other times, the germs are in the urine but do not cause any symptoms. This is like a silent infection. Doctors often give antibiotic pills for these silent infections. They hope the pills will stop a real, painful UTI from happening later. This could help keep the person and their new kidney healthy.

But we are not sure if this is the right thing to do. Antibiotic pills can have bad effects. They can cause an upset stomach. They can also make germs stronger over time. This makes future infections harder to treat. This study looked at past research to see if giving antibiotics for a silent urine infection is helpful or harmful.

**Trial Design**

This was a review study. This means the researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they looked for and studied research that was already done.

The researchers found two studies to review. In total, these studies included 212 people. All of these people had a new kidney and a silent urine infection.

In these studies, the people were put into two groups.
*   One group took antibiotic pills for the silent infection.
*   The other group took no medicine for the silent infection.

The researchers then compared what happened to the people in both groups. They wanted to see if the group that took the pills had better results.

**Results**

The review of the studies did not give a clear answer. The researchers found that we still do not know if antibiotics are helpful for a silent urine infection.

In both groups, the germs often stayed in the urine. It did not matter if people took the antibiotic pills or not. It was also not clear if taking the pills stopped people from getting a painful UTI later.

The researchers also looked to see if the pills helped the new kidney work better. And they checked if the pills helped people stay out of the hospital or live longer. The studies did not have enough information to answer these questions.

One study looked at bad reactions to the pills. It showed that serious side effects were not seen. Other, less serious side effects seemed rare. But there was not enough information to know if taking the pills made germs stronger and harder to kill in the future.

The researchers concluded that we need more research. The studies they looked at were small. They also had some problems in how they were done. For now, it is uncertain if giving antibiotics for a silent urine infection helps people with a new kidney.","Antibiotics for bacterial infection in the urine in kidney transplant recipients when there are no symptoms

In both studies, participants knew which treatment they were receiving (i.e. antibiotics or no therapy), which may have influenced the results. Last, we had not enough data to estimate with precision some effects of antibiotics. More research is needed.

Does Removing More Cancer During Surgery Help Women with Ovarian Cancer Live Longer?

### **Rationale**

**What is ovarian cancer?**

Ovarian cancer is a type of cancer that grows in a woman's ovaries. Ovaries are the small organs that make eggs. This type of cancer is one of the more common cancers that affect women. This study looked at a specific kind of ovarian cancer that starts on the outside layer of the ovary.

**Why did we do this study?**

The first treatment for advanced ovarian cancer is often surgery. During surgery, doctors try to remove as much of the cancer as they can. The amount of cancer left behind after surgery is very important. It can help predict how well a patient will do.

Some doctors disagree about how much cancer needs to be removed. The goal is to leave behind as little as possible. The best case is when no cancer can be seen after surgery. Another good outcome is when only very small pieces are left. We needed to know if the effort to remove almost all the cancer really helps women live longer. This study looked at past research to find a clear answer.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new medical trial with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of studies that were already done. This is called a review. A review helps us understand what most of the science says about a topic.

The researchers found 11 past studies to look at. These studies were a good fit for the questions they had. All the studies looked back at the medical records of women who already had surgery for ovarian cancer. The studies used special math to check that their results were strong.

The women in these studies all had advanced ovarian cancer. This means the cancer had spread from the ovaries.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The review found that removing more cancer during surgery helps women live longer.

*   **Best Result: No Visible Cancer Left**
    Women who had all visible cancer removed lived the longest. Their cancer also took much longer to come back or start growing again. This was the best possible outcome for patients.

*   **Good Result: A Small Amount of Cancer Left**
    Women who had a small amount of cancer left behind also did well. This means the pieces of cancer left were smaller than 1 centimeter (about the size of a pea). These women lived longer than women who had larger pieces of cancer left behind.

*   **Less Benefit: More Cancer Left**
    If larger pieces of cancer were left behind, the benefits of the surgery were smaller. There was not a big difference in how long women lived if their remaining cancer was just under or just over 2 centimeters.

**What does this mean for patients?**

This review shows how important surgery is for advanced ovarian cancer. The results support the idea that surgeons should try to remove every piece of cancer they can see. If they cannot remove all of it, their goal should be to leave behind only very small pieces. This gives patients the best chance to live longer and have more time before their cancer grows back.

The researchers noted that the studies they reviewed had some weaknesses. They think we need new studies to be sure that the surgery itself is what helps, and not other things about the patients. The old studies also did not report on the side effects of surgery or how it affected patients’ quality of life.","Clear survival benefit is achieved if all or most (< 1 cm remaining) of the tumour after primary surgical treatment for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer is removed

10.1002-14651858.CD013315,"Background
High altitude illness (HAI) is a term used to describe a group of mainly cerebral and pulmonary syndromes that can occur during travel to elevations above 2500 metres (˜ 8200 feet). Acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude cerebral oedema (HACE), and high altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) are reported as potential medical problems associated with high altitude ascent. In this, the third of a series of three reviews about preventive strategies for HAI, we assessed the effectiveness of miscellaneous and non‐pharmacological interventions. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical effectiveness and adverse events of miscellaneous and non‐pharmacological interventions for preventing acute HAI in people who are at risk of developing high altitude illness in any setting. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) in January 2019. We adapted the MEDLINE strategy for searching the other databases. We used a combination of thesaurus‐based and free‐text search terms. We scanned the reference lists and citations of included trials and any relevant systematic reviews that we identified for further references to additional trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials conducted in any setting where non‐pharmacological and miscellaneous interventions were employed to prevent acute HAI, including preacclimatization measures and the administration of non‐pharmacological supplements. We included trials involving participants who are at risk of developing high altitude illness (AMS or HACE, or HAPE, or both). We included participants with, and without, a history of high altitude illness. We applied no age or gender restrictions. We included trials where the relevant intervention was administered before the beginning of ascent. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures employed by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 20 studies (1406 participants, 21 references) in this review. Thirty studies (14 ongoing, and 16 pending classification (awaiting)) will be considered in future versions of this suite of three reviews as appropriate. We report the results for the primary outcome of this review (risk of AMS) by each group of assessed interventions. 
Group 1. Preacclimatization and other measures based on pressure 
Use of simulated altitude or remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) might not improve the risk of AMS on subsequent exposure to altitude, but this effect is uncertain (simulated altitude: risk ratio (RR) 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.71; I² = 0%; 3 trials, 140 participants; low‐quality evidence. RIPC: RR 3.0, 95% CI 0.69 to 13.12; 1 trial, 40 participants; low‐quality evidence). We found evidence of improvement of this risk using positive end‐expiratory pressure (PEEP), but this information was derived from a cross‐over trial with a limited number of participants (OR 3.67, 95% CI 1.38 to 9.76; 1 trial, 8 participants; low‐quality evidence). We found scarcity of evidence about the risk of adverse events for these interventions. 
Group 2. Supplements and vitamins 
Supplementation of antioxidants, medroxyprogesterone, iron or Rhodiola crenulata might not improve the risk of AMS on exposure to high altitude, but this effect is uncertain (antioxidants: RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.03; 1 trial, 18 participants; low‐quality evidence. Medroxyprogesterone: RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.05; I² = 0%; 2 trials, 32 participants; low‐quality evidence. Iron: RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.11; I² = 0%; 2 trials, 65 participants; low‐quality evidence. R crenulata: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.29; 1 trial, 125 participants; low‐quality evidence). We found evidence of improvement of this risk with the administration of erythropoietin, but this information was extracted from a trial with issues related to risk of bias and imprecision (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.84; 1 trial, 39 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Regarding administration of ginkgo biloba, we did not perform a pooled estimation of RR for AMS due to considerable heterogeneity between the included studies (I² = 65%). RR estimates from the individual studies were conflicting (from 0.05 to 1.03; low‐quality evidence). We found scarcity of evidence about the risk of adverse events for these interventions. 
Group 3. Other comparisons 
We found heterogeneous evidence regarding the risk of AMS when ginkgo biloba was compared with acetazolamide (I² = 63%). RR estimates from the individual studies were conflicting (estimations from 0.11 (95% CI 0.01 to 1.86) to 2.97 (95% CI 1.70 to 5.21); low‐quality evidence). We found evidence of improvement when ginkgo biloba was administered along with acetazolamide, but this information was derived from a single trial with issues associated to risk of bias (compared to ginkgo biloba alone: RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.71; 1 trial, 311 participants; low‐quality evidence). Administration of medroxyprogesterone plus acetazolamide did not improve the risk of AMS when compared to administration of medroxyprogesterone or acetazolamide alone (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.50 to 3.55; 1 trial, 12 participants; low‐quality evidence). We found scarcity of evidence about the risk of adverse events for these interventions. 
Authors' conclusions
This Cochrane Review is the final in a series of three providing relevant information to clinicians, and other interested parties, on how to prevent high altitude illness. The assessment of non‐pharmacological and miscellaneous interventions suggests that there is heterogeneous and even contradictory evidence related to the effectiveness of these prophylactic strategies. Safety of these interventions remains as an unclear issue due to lack of assessment. Overall, the evidence is limited due to its quality (low to very low), the relative paucity of that evidence and the number of studies pending classification for the three reviews belonging to this series (30 studies either awaiting classification or ongoing). Additional studies, especially those comparing with pharmacological alternatives (such as acetazolamide) are required, in order to establish or refute the strategies evaluated in this review.

Do Treatments Without Drugs Help Prevent Sickness at High Altitudes?

### **Rationale**

When people travel to high places, like tall mountains, they can get sick. This is called high altitude illness. This can happen at heights over 8,200 feet. The sickness can cause headaches and dizziness. In serious cases, it can lead to dangerous problems with the brain and lungs.

Researchers wanted to know if there are ways to prevent this sickness without using standard drugs. They looked at things like special breathing methods, vitamins, and supplements. This study was needed to find out if these other treatments work. This can help doctors and people who travel to high places make safe choices.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of 20 older studies. This type of study gathers all the information on a topic in one place.

The 20 studies included more than 1,400 people. The people in these studies were at risk of getting altitude sickness. They were men and women of all ages. In each of the original studies, people were given a non-drug treatment before they went to a high place to see if it would prevent sickness.

### **Results**

The researchers found that there is not strong proof that most of these treatments work. For many treatments, the results from different studies were mixed up or not clear. The safety of these treatments is also not known because it was not studied well.

**Getting the Body Ready and Breathing Methods**

*   Some studies tested getting the body used to a fake high altitude before a trip. This might not help prevent sickness.
*   Another method briefly squeezed an arm or leg to prepare the body for low oxygen. This also might not work.
*   A breathing treatment that uses gentle pressure to help the lungs may work. But this was tested on only 8 people, so we cannot be sure.

**Supplements and Vitamins**

*   Taking supplements like antioxidants, iron, or a plant called *Rhodiola* might not prevent altitude sickness.
*   The results for a plant called *ginkgo biloba* were very mixed. Some studies showed that it helped, but other studies showed it did not. Because of this, we do not know if it works.
*   A hormone that helps make red blood cells might help. But the study that tested it was not of high quality.

**Final Conclusions**

The researchers concluded that we do not have good proof that non-drug treatments prevent high altitude sickness. The proof we have is weak, and some studies even disagree with each other. We also do not know if these treatments are safe.

More and better studies are needed. These new studies should compare these treatments to standard medicines that are known to work. This will help us learn for sure what can help people stay healthy at high altitudes.","Diverse strategies for preventing high altitude illness
Background 
The term high altitude illness (HAI) is used to describe a group of brain and lung conditions that can occur when people travel to altitudes above approximately 2500 metres (approximately 8200 feet). Individuals can respond to high altitudes in different ways and experience a variety of symptoms. These include HAI‐related headache, nausea, vomiting and tiredness, often called acute mountain sickness. Drowsiness, confusion or unconsciousness can occur when the brain is particularly affected (high altitude cerebral oedema or HACE), and cough or breathlessness when it is the lungs (high altitude pulmonary oedema or HAPE). A number of different strategies are used to prevent HAI. In this review we assessed the evidence from randomized controlled trials on whether various approaches could prevent the onset of high altitude illness, with a focus on non‐drug approaches, herbs and natural supplements. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to January 2019. We included 20 randomized controlled studies involving 1406 participants. The studies looked at diverse approaches to HAI prevention. These approaches included strategies to acclimatize to high altitudes by mimicking quick ascents by reducing levels of oxygen in the air that participants are breathing, and herbal products or vitamin supplements available without a prescription. 
The participants ranged in age between 17 and 65 years. Only one study included people at high risk of developing HAI as they had a history of HAI. Four trials provided the intervention between one to three days before making the ascent (20% of the studies), and eight between four to 30 days before departure for the ascent (40% of the studies). The participants in all these studies reached a final altitude of between 3500 and 5500 metres above sea level. Most of the studies did not provide clear information on how they were funded (55% of studies). Thirty additional studies were classified as either ongoing (14 studies), or awaiting classification (16 studies), and they will be considered in future versions of this suite of three reviews as appropriate. 
Key results 
The evidence for any benefit of the various strategies is inconclusive, and even contradictory among the included studies. 
In three studies comparing normal levels of oxygen with low oxygen levels as a way of acclimatization before leaving for high altitudes, we found no differences in the risk of developing acute mountain sickness (3 trials, 140 participants; low‐quality evidence). Adverse events were not reported, nor were high altitude cerebral oedema (HACE) or pulmonary oedema (HAPE). 
Ginkgo biloba was compared with taking an inactive placebo in seven studies (523 participants) looking at acute mountain sickness. There was no difference between ginkgo biloba and placebo in terms of the risk of developing HACE (3 studies, 371 participants), or in the risk of developing tingling or pricking, often described as 'pins and needles', as a side effect of treatment (2 studies, 352 participants). No HAPE events were reported (3 studies, 371 participants). 
Ginkgo biloba was compared with acetazolamide, which is a drug used to prevent acute mountain sickness, in four studies (397 participants). The findings differed between the studies, and no conclusions could be drawn. Acetazolamide increased the risk of developing pins and needles in two studies (354 participants). No HAPE or HACE events were reported. Overall, the limited information on the safety of the various interventions means that their safety remains unclear. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was low to very low. We could not obtain the full text reports of some of the studies we had identified, which limited the number of studies included in the review. Many of the studies had small numbers of participants; and for some outcomes few events occurred so that any findings were uncertain. Additional research is needed to clarify the effectiveness and safety of the various strategies to reduce HAI.

10.1002-14651858.CD013245.pub2,"Background
Systemic androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), also referred to as hormone therapy, has long been the primary treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. Additional agents have been reserved for the castrate‐resistant disease stage when ADT start becoming less effective. Abiraterone is an agent with an established role in that disease stage, which has only recently been evaluated in the hormone‐sensitive setting. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of early abiraterone acetate, in combination with systemic ADT, for newly diagnosed metastatic hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, six other databases, two trials registries, grey literature, and conference proceedings, up to 15 May 2020. We applied no restrictions on publication language or status. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized trials, in which men diagnosed with hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer were administered abiraterone acetate and prednisolone with ADT or ADT alone. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. We performed statistical analysesusing a random‐effects model. We rated the quality of evidence according to the GRADE approach. 
Main results
The search identified two randomized controlled trials (RCT), with 2201 men, who were assigned to receive either abiraterone acetate 1000 mg once daily and low dose prednisone (5mg) in addition to ADT, or ADT alone. In the LATITUDE trial, the median age and range of men in the intervention group was 68 (38 to 89) years, and 67 (33 to 92) years in the control group. Nearly all of the men in this study (97.6%) had prostate cancer with a Gleason score of at least 8 (ISUP grade group 4). 
Primary outcomes 
The addition of abiraterone acetate to ADT reduces the probability of death from any cause compared to ADT alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56 to 0.73; 2 RCTs, 2201 men; high certainty of evidence); this corresponds to 163 fewer deaths per 1000 men with hormone‐sensitive metastatic prostate cancer (210 fewer to 115 fewer) at five years. 
Abiraterone acetate in addition to ADT probably results in little to no difference in quality of life compared to ADT alone, measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐prostate total score (FACT‐P; range 0 to 156; higher values indicates better quality of life), at 12 months (mean difference [MD] 2.90 points, 95% CI 0.11 to 5.60; 1 RCT, 838 men; moderate certainty of evidence). 
Secondary outcomes 
Abiraterone plus ADT increases the risk of grades III to V adverse events compared to ADT alone (risk ratio [RR] 1.34, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.47; 1 RCT, 1199 men; high certainty of evidence); this corresponds to 162 more grade III to V events per 1000 men with hormone‐sensitive metastatic prostate cancer (105 more to 224 more) at a median follow‐up of 30 months. 
Abiraterone acetate in addition to ADT probably reduces the probability of death due to prostate cancer compared to ADT alone (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.68; 2 RCTs, 2201 men; moderate certainty of evidence). This corresponds to 120 fewer death from prostate cancer per 1000 men with hormone‐sensitive metastatic prostate cancer (95% CI 145 fewer to 90 fewer) after a median follow‐up of 30 months. 
The addition of abiraterone acetate to ADT probably decreases the probability of disease progression compared to ADT alone (HR 0.35, 95%CI 0.26 to 0.49; 2 RCTs, 2097 men; moderate certainty of evidence). This corresponds to 369 fewer incidences of disease progression per 1000 men with hormone‐sensitive metastatic prostate cancer (456 fewer to 256 fewer) after a median follow‐up of 30 months. 
The addition of abiraterone acetate to ADT probably increases the risk of discontinuing treatment due to adverse events compared to ADT alone (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.92; 1 RCT, 1199 men; moderate certainty of evidence). This corresponds to 51 more men (95% CI 17 more to 93 more) discontinuing treatment because of adverse events per 1000 men treated with abiraterone acetate and ADT compared to ADT alone after a median follow‐up of 30 months. 
Authors' conclusions
The addition of abiraterone acetate to androgen deprivation therapy improves overall survival but probably not quality of life. It probably also extends disease‐specific survival, and delays disease progression compared to androgen deprivation therapy alone. However, the risk of grades III to V adverse events is increased, and probably, so is the risk of discontinuing treatment due to adverse events.

A Study of a New Drug Added to Standard Treatment for Prostate Cancer That Has Spread

### **Rationale**

Prostate cancer is a disease that affects men. Sometimes, the cancer can spread to other parts of the body. When it spreads, doctors often use a treatment to lower male hormones in the body. This is called hormone therapy. Hormone therapy can help control the cancer for a while.

Over time, hormone therapy may stop working as well. A drug called abiraterone is often used at this later stage. Researchers wanted to know if using abiraterone much earlier would be more helpful.

This study looked at what happens when men take abiraterone at the start of their treatment. The goal was to see if adding abiraterone to standard hormone therapy could help men live longer and slow down the cancer.

### **Trial Design**

This paper reviewed two large studies. These studies looked at a total of 2,201 men. All the men had prostate cancer that had spread to other parts of their body. Their cancer could still be treated with hormone therapy. The average age of the men was about 67 years old.

The men were put into two groups by chance, like flipping a coin. This helps make sure the groups are compared fairly.

*   One group received the standard hormone therapy alone.
*   The other group received the standard hormone therapy plus the study drug, abiraterone. They also took a low-dose steroid pill called prednisone.

Researchers followed the men for several years to see how they did.

### **Results**

Here is what the researchers found when they compared the two groups.

**What were the benefits of adding abiraterone?**

*   **Men lived longer.** After five years, for every 1000 men in the study, 163 fewer men who took abiraterone had died compared to those who only got hormone therapy.
*   **The cancer was slower to get worse.** For every 1000 men, 369 fewer men who took abiraterone had their cancer get worse after about two and a half years.
*   **Fewer men died from prostate cancer.** The study also showed that adding abiraterone helped lower the number of deaths caused by prostate cancer itself.

**What were the downsides of adding abiraterone?**

*   **There was no real change in quality of life.** Men who took abiraterone did not report feeling better or worse than the men who did not take it.
*   **There were more serious side effects.** For every 1000 men who took abiraterone, 162 more had serious side effects compared to the other group.
*   **More men had to stop treatment.** Because of side effects, more men in the abiraterone group had to stop taking the study drug. For every 1000 men, 51 more men stopped treatment in the abiraterone group.

In conclusion, the study showed that adding abiraterone to standard hormone therapy helps men live longer and slows the spread of their prostate cancer. However, it also increases the risk of serious side effects. Patients and their doctors should talk about these benefits and risks to decide on the best treatment plan.","Adding abiraterone acetate to androgen deprivation therapy for the treatment of metastatic hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer 
Review question 
The aim of this review was to find out what the effect of adding abiraterone was, in men with prostate cancer, who were receiving and still responding to hormone therapy. 
Background 
Abiraterone acetate is a medication that blocks the effect of male sex hormones, and thereby, slows down prostate cancer growth.  
More than 15% of men diagnosed with prostate cancer present with disease that has spread beyond the prostate. Another 15% to 30% of men who undergo primary treatment will experience a return of their cancer. Hormone therapy (drugs to reduce the level of male hormones) has been the main treatment for advanced disease, but this does not work forever. Recent studies have looked at whether drugs that block the growth of prostate cancer cells, such as abiraterone acetate, can improve how men do. 
Study characteristics 
We found two studies (specifically, studies in which 'chance' decided what treatment men got), with a total of 2201 men. The studies compared abiraterone acetate and hormone therapy to hormone therapy alone. In one of the studies, most of the included men had high risk prostate cancer, and had previously undergone local treatment. In the other study, most men had not had previous treatment to their prostate. The evidence is current to 15 May 2020. 
Key results 
Adding abiraterone acetate to hormone therapy improves overall survival but probably not quality of life. It probably improves cancer‐specific survival and reduces disease progression. However, there is also an increase in severe and life‐threatening side effects, likely leading to discontinued treatment, with the addition of abiraterone acetate. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the certainty of the evidence to be high for overall survival (time to death from any cause), and severe and life‐threatening side effects. This means that our estimates are likely to be close to the actual effect for these outcomes. The certainty of the evidence was moderate for quality of life, cancer‐specific survival (time to death from prostate cancer), time to disease progression, and discontinued treatment due to adverse events. This means that our estimates are likely to be close to the actual effect, but there were some limitations in the studies that reduced our confidence in the results.

This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of acupuncture on osteoarthritis. 
The review shows that in people with osteoarthritis, 
‐Acupuncture may lead to small improvements in pain and physical function after 8 weeks. 
‐Acupuncture may lead to small improvements in pain and physical function after 26 weeks.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints, such as your knee or hip. When the joint loses cartilage, the bone grows to try and repair the damage. Instead of making things better, however, the bone grows abnormally and makes things worse. For example, the bone can become misshapen and make the joint painful and unstable. This can affect your physical function or ability to use your knee. 
According to the philosophy of traditional acupuncture, energy circulates in 'meridians' located throughout the body.  Pain or ill health happens when something occurs to cause this meridian energy circulation to be blocked. The way to restore health is to stimulate the appropriate combination of acupuncture points in the body by inserting very thin needles.  Sometimes in painful conditions, electrical stimulation along with the needles is also used.  According to acupuncture theory, one way you can tell that acupuncture is relieving pain is that you may feel numbness or tingling, called de qi, where the needle is inserted. 
Best estimate of what happens to people with osteoarthritis who have acupuncture: 
Pain after 8 weeks: 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by about 4 points on a scale of 0 to 20.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by about 3 points on a scale of 0 to 20. 
‐People who received acupuncture had a 1 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐20.  (5% absolute improvement). 
Pain after 26 weeks: 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by slightly more than 3 points on a scale of 0 to 20.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by slightly less than 3 points on a scale of 0 to 20. 
‐People who received acupuncture had under a 1 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐20.  (2% absolute improvement).  
Physical function after 8 weeks : 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 11 points on a scale of 0 to 68.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 8 points on a scale of 0 to 68. 
‐People who received acupuncture had about a 3 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐68.  (4% absolute improvement)  
Physical function after 26 weeks : 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 11 points on a scale of 0 to 68.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 10 points on a scale of 0 to 68.

### **Plain Title**

Does Acupuncture Help with Joint Pain from Osteoarthritis?

### **Rationale**

**What is osteoarthritis?**

Osteoarthritis is a disease that affects your joints, like your knees or hips. Inside your joints, there is a soft cushion called cartilage. This cushion helps your bones move smoothly.

In osteoarthritis, this soft cushion wears away. This can cause pain and make your joints stiff. It can be hard to walk or do your daily tasks. Many people with this disease live with long-term pain.

**Why did we do this study?**

Acupuncture is a treatment that uses very thin needles. The needles are placed in certain spots on the body. Some people believe this can help to relieve pain.

Researchers wanted to know if acupuncture really helps people with osteoarthritis. They looked at the results from many past studies. This helps to get a clear and fair answer about whether this treatment works.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of many other studies that had already been done. This type of study is called a review. It helps to combine all the information we have.

In the studies, people with osteoarthritis were split into groups. One group got real acupuncture. Another group got “sham” acupuncture. Sham acupuncture is a fake treatment. The needles might not have been put in the right spots, or they may not have gone into the skin.

Using a sham group helps us know if the real treatment is truly working. Researchers then compared the results of the two groups. They checked on people’s pain and movement after 8 weeks and after 26 weeks.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The study found that acupuncture may offer small benefits for people with osteoarthritis. People who got real acupuncture had slightly better results than those who got fake acupuncture.

**How did acupuncture affect pain?**

After 8 weeks, both groups felt less pain. The group that got real acupuncture had a little more pain relief than the group that got fake acupuncture. The difference was very small.

After 26 weeks, the difference in pain relief between the two groups was even smaller.

**How did acupuncture affect movement?**

The studies also looked at how well people could move and do daily tasks.

After 8 weeks, people who had real acupuncture saw a small improvement in their movement. This improvement was slightly better than the group that got fake acupuncture.

After 26 weeks, there was almost no difference in movement between the two groups.

**What about side effects?**

Side effects from acupuncture are usually small. Some people might have a small bruise or a little bleeding where the needle went in. We do not have much information about serious side effects because they are very rare.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

Acupuncture may lead to small improvements in pain and movement for people with osteoarthritis. However, these benefits are not large when compared to a fake acupuncture treatment. The small benefits seen early on may become even smaller over time.","Acupuncture for osteoarthritis

Hepatorenal syndrome is defined as renal failure in people with cirrhosis in the absence of other causes. In addition to supportive treatment such as albumin to restore fluid balance, the other potential treatments include systemic vasoconstrictor drugs (such as vasopressin analogues or noradrenaline), renal vasodilator drugs (such as dopamine), transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), and liver support with molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS). There is uncertainty over the best treatment regimen for hepatorenal syndrome. 
Objectives
To compare the benefits and harms of different treatments for hepatorenal syndrome in people with decompensated liver cirrhosis. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trial registers until December 2018 to identify randomised clinical trials on hepatorenal syndrome in people with cirrhosis. 
Selection criteria
We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) in adults with cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently identified eligible trials and collected data. The outcomes for this review included mortality, serious adverse events, any adverse events, resolution of hepatorenal syndrome, liver transplantation, and other decompensation events. We performed a network meta‐analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the odds ratio (OR), rate ratio, hazard ratio (HR), and mean difference (MD) with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an available‐case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. 
Main results
We included a total of 25 trials (1263 participants; 12 interventions) in the review. Twenty‐three trials (1185 participants) were included in one or more outcomes. All the trials but two were at high risk of bias, and all the evidence was of low or very low certainty. The trials included participants with liver cirrhosis of varied aetiologies as well as a mixture of type I hepatorenal syndrome only, type II hepatorenal syndrome only, or people with both type I and type II hepatorenal syndrome. Participant age ranged from 42 to 60 years, and the proportion of females ranged from 5.8% to 61.5% in the trials that reported this information. The follow‐up in the trials ranged from one week to six months. Overall, 59% of participants died during this period and about 35% of participants recovered from hepatorenal syndrome. The most common interventions compared were albumin plus terlipressin, albumin plus noradrenaline, and albumin alone. 
There was no evidence of a difference in mortality (22 trials; 1153 participants) at maximal follow‐up between the different interventions. None of the trials reported health‐related quality of life. There was no evidence of differences in the proportion of people with serious adverse events (three trials; 428 participants), number of participants with serious adverse events per participant (two trials; 166 participants), proportion of participants with any adverse events (four trials; 402 participants), the proportion of people who underwent liver transplantation at maximal follow‐up (four trials; 342 participants), or other features of decompensation at maximal follow‐up (one trial; 466 participants). Five trials (293 participants) reported number of any adverse events, and five trials (219 participants) reported treatment costs. Albumin plus noradrenaline had fewer numbers of adverse events per participant (rate ratio 0.51, 95% CrI 0.28 to 0.87). Eighteen trials (1047 participants) reported recovery from hepatorenal syndrome (as per definition of hepatorenal syndrome). In terms of recovery from hepatorenal syndrome, in the direct comparisons, albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide and albumin plus octreotide had lower recovery from hepatorenal syndrome than albumin plus terlipressin (HR 0.04; 95% CrI 0.00 to 0.25 and HR 0.26, 95% CrI 0.07 to 0.80 respectively). There was no evidence of differences between the groups in any of the other direct comparisons. In the network meta‐analysis, albumin and albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide had lower recovery from hepatorenal syndrome compared with albumin plus terlipressin. 
Funding: two trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies; five trials were funded by parties who had no vested interest in the results of the trial; and 18 trials did not report the source of funding. 
Authors' conclusions
Based on very low‐certainty evidence, there is no evidence of benefit or harm of any of the interventions for hepatorenal syndrome with regards to the following outcomes: all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events (proportion), number of serious adverse events per participant, any adverse events (proportion), liver transplantation, or other decompensation events. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that albumin plus noradrenaline had fewer 'any adverse events per participant' than albumin plus terlipressin. Low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence also found that albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide and albumin alone had lower recovery from hepatorenal syndrome compared with albumin plus terlipressin. 
Future randomised clinical trials should be adequately powered; employ blinding, avoid post‐randomisation dropouts or planned cross‐overs (or perform an intention‐to‐treat analysis); and report clinically important outcomes such as mortality, health‐related quality of life, adverse events, and recovery from hepatorenal syndrome. Albumin plus noradrenaline and albumin plus terlipressin appear to be the interventions that should be compared in future trials.

### **Plain Title**

Comparing Treatments for Kidney Failure in People with Serious Liver Disease

### **Rationale**

**What is the health problem?**

The liver is a very important organ in the body. Some people get a disease called cirrhosis. This is when the liver gets badly scarred and stops working well.

When the liver is very sick, it can cause the kidneys to stop working. This is a very serious problem called hepatorenal syndrome, or HRS. It can be life-threatening. People with HRS need treatment right away.

**Why did we do this study?**

Doctors have many ways to treat HRS. They can use different medicines to help the body. But doctors are not sure which treatment is best. They do not know which one helps people the most or has the fewest side effects.

This study looked at all the past research on HRS treatments. The main goal was to compare all the treatments. We wanted to see if one treatment was better than the others at helping people with HRS.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked for all the studies that were already done on this topic. They combined the results from all these past studies to get a bigger picture. This type of study is called a review.

The researchers looked for a specific type of study. These studies are the best kind for comparing treatments. In these studies, people are put into groups by chance to get different treatments.

The researchers found 25 studies to include in their review. In total, these studies had more than 1,200 people. The people in the studies were adults with both cirrhosis and HRS. Their ages were between 42 and 60 years. The studies included both men and women.

Each study watched patients for a certain amount of time. This time ranged from one week to six months. Researchers looked at what happened to the patients during that time.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The researchers found that the proof from past studies was not very strong. This is because most of the studies they looked at were small. They also had some problems in how they were designed. This made it hard to be sure about the results.

Here is what the researchers found:

*   **Helping people live longer:** No single treatment was clearly better than any other at preventing death. In the studies, about 6 out of every 10 people died. This was true no matter which treatment they received.
*   **Making the kidneys work again:** About 1 in 3 people got better from their kidney failure. One drug combination seemed to work better for this. A drug called terlipressin, given with a protein called albumin, helped more people get better than some other treatments did.
*   **Side effects:** The study looked at bad effects from the medicines. One treatment seemed to have fewer side effects. This was a drug called noradrenaline, given with albumin. It seemed to cause fewer problems than the terlipressin and albumin combination.
*   **How patients felt:** None of the studies looked at how the treatments made people feel. They did not report on things like pain or comfort.

**What do these results mean?**

Based on the proof we have now, there is no clear best treatment for HRS. No treatment was proven to help people live longer.

Some treatments may help the kidneys start working again. But these same treatments may also have more side effects.

The researchers believe we need new and better studies. Future studies should be larger. They should be designed very carefully to give clear answers. The researchers suggest that new studies should compare terlipressin and noradrenaline. This will help doctors and patients know which treatment is truly best for hepatorenal syndrome.","Treatment of hepatorenal syndrome
What is the aim of this Cochrane review? 
To find out the best treatment for decreased kidney function (hepatorenal syndrome) in people with liver cirrhosis (a form of advanced liver disease with scarring of the liver) with complications. The authors collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 25 randomised controlled trials (participants receive the treatment based on method similar to coin toss or lottery; this is to ensure that the people who receive the different treatments are similar in all aspects except the treatment, so that any differences in the results between the treatments can be attributed to the treatment rather than differences in the type of people who received the treatment). During analysis of data, authors used standard Cochrane techniques, which allows comparison of two treatments at a time. Authors also used advanced techniques, that allow comparison of many treatments at the same time (usually referred as 'network meta‐analysis' or 'multiple treatment comparisons'). The aim is to gather reliable evidence on the relative benefits and harms of the different treatments. 
Date of literature search December 2018 
Key messages Only two studies were conducted well. The remaining studies had one or more flaws. Therefore, there is high uncertainty in the results of the analysis. The authors could not recommend one treatment over another on the basis of risk of death, serious complications, percentage of people who developed any complication, percentage of participants who underwent liver transplantation (replacement of a diseased liver with a healthy one), or the number of other liver failure events. Health‐related quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. The number of complications of any severity was lower with albumin plus noradrenaline than albumin plus terlipressin. Recovery from hepatorenal syndrome may be lower with albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide and albumin alone than albumin plus terlipressin and albumin plus noradrenaline. 
Funding source was unclear in 18 studies. Industrial organisations funded two studies and the remaining five studies did not receive any funding from industrial organisations. 
What was studied in the review? 
This review studied people of any sex, age, and origin, having advanced liver disease due to various causes, and who had developed hepatorenal syndrome. People were administered different treatments. The review authors excluded studies with liver‐transplanted participants. Participants age, when reported, ranged from 42 to 60 years. The number of females ranged from 6 to 62 out of 100 in the studies that reported this information. The main treatments compared were albumin alone, albumin plus terlipressin, and albumin plus noradrenaline. The authors gathered and analysed data on death, quality of life, serious and non‐serious complications, time to liver transplantation, recovery from hepatorenal syndrome, and disappearance of symptoms. 
What were the main results of the review? 
The 25 studies included a small number of participants (1263 participants). Study data were sparse. Twenty‐three studies with 1185 participants provided data for analyses. The follow‐up in the trials ranged from one week to six months. The review shows that: 
‐ About 60 out of every 100 people died within three months, and 35 out of every 100 people recovered from hepatorenal syndrome. 
‐ The provided treatment may make no difference to the percentage of people who died or developed serious complications, number of serious complications per person, percentage of people who developed complications of any severity, or the percentage of people undergoing liver transplantation. 
‐ None of the trials reported health‐related quality of life.
‐ The number of complications of any severity was lower with albumin plus noradrenaline than albumin plus terlipressin. 
‐ Recovery from hepatorenal syndrome may be lower with albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide and albumin alone than albumin plus terlipressin and albumin plus noradrenaline. 
‐ We have very low confidence in the overall results.
‐ Future trials with proper design and quality are needed to clarify the best treatment for people with advanced liver disease having hepatorenal syndrome.

It is common for people not to take antidepressant medication as prescribed, with around 50% of people likely to prematurely discontinue taking their medication after six months. Community pharmacists may be well placed to have a role in antidepressant management because of their unique pharmacotherapeutic knowledge and ease of access for people. Pharmacists are in an ideal position to offer proactive interventions to people with depression or depressive symptoms. However, the effectiveness and acceptability of existing pharmacist‐based interventions is not yet well understood. The degree to which a pharmacy‐based management approach might be beneficial, acceptable to people, and effective as part of the overall management for those with depression is, to date, unclear. A systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) will help answer these questions and add important knowledge to the currently sparse evidence base. 
Objectives
To examine the effects of pharmacy‐based management interventions compared with active control (e.g. patient information materials or any other active intervention delivered by someone other than the pharmacist or the pharmacy team), waiting list, or treatment as usual (e.g. standard pharmacist advice or antidepressant education, signposting to support available in primary care services, brief medication counselling, and/or (self‐)monitoring of medication adherence offered by a healthcare professional outside the pharmacy team) at improving depression outcomes in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMD‐CTR) to June 2016; the Cochrane Library (Issue 11, 2018); and Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to December 2018. We searched theses and dissertation databases and international trial registers for unpublished/ongoing trials. We applied no restrictions on date, language, or publication status to the searches.  
Selection criteria
We included all RCTs and cluster‐RCTs where a pharmacy‐based intervention was compared with treatment as usual, waiting list, or an alternative intervention in the management of depression in adults over 16 years of age. Eligible studies had to report at least one of the following outcomes at any time point: depression symptom change, acceptability of the intervention, diagnosis of depression, non‐adherence to medication, frequency of primary care appointments, quality of life, social functioning, or adverse events.  
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently, and in duplicate, conducted all stages of study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment (including GRADE). We discussed disagreements within the team until we reached consensus. Where data did not allow meta‐analyses, we synthesised results narratively.  
Main results
Twelve studies (2215 participants) met the inclusion criteria and compared pharmacy‐based management with treatment as usual. Two studies (291 participants) also included an active control (both used patient information leaflets providing information about the prescribed antidepressant). Neither of these studies reported depression symptom change. A narrative synthesis of results on acceptability of the intervention was inconclusive, with one study reporting better acceptability of pharmacy‐based management and the other better acceptability of the active control. One study reported that participants in the pharmacy‐based management group had better medication adherence than the control participants. One study reported adverse events with no difference between groups. The studies reported no other outcomes. 
Meta‐analyses comparing pharmacy‐based management with treatment as usual showed no evidence of a difference in the effect of the intervention on depression symptom change (dichotomous data; improvement in symptoms yes/no: risk ratio (RR), 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05; 4 RCTs, 475 participants; moderate‐quality evidence; continuous data: standard mean difference (SMD) ‐0.04, 95% CI ‐0.19 to 0.10; 5 RCTs, 718 participants; high‐certainty evidence), or acceptability of the intervention (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.45; 12 RCTs, 2072 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The risk of non‐adherence was reduced in participants receiving pharmacy‐based management (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.87; 6 RCTs, 911 participants; high‐certainty evidence). We were unable to meta‐analyse data on diagnosis of depression, frequency of primary care appointments, quality of life, or social functioning. 
Authors' conclusions
We found no evidence of a difference between pharmacy‐based management for depression in adults compared with treatment as usual in facilitating depression symptom change. Based on numbers of participants leaving the trials early, there may be no difference in acceptability between pharmacy‐based management and controls. However, there was uncertainty due to the low‐certainty evidence.

Can Pharmacists Help People with Depression Take Their Medicine?

**Rationale**

Depression is a common health problem. It can make you feel sad, tired, and not interested in things you used to enjoy. These feelings can last for a long time and make daily life difficult.

Doctors can prescribe medicines to help treat depression. These medicines can help your brain work in a way that eases these sad feelings. For these medicines to work well, you need to take them every day, just as your doctor tells you to.

But it can be hard to take a medicine every day. Many people forget to take it or decide to stop taking it. Studies show that about half of all people stop taking their depression medicine within six months. When this happens, the medicine may not have a chance to work properly, and the feelings of depression can stay or come back.

Pharmacists are experts in medicines. They work in local drug stores and are often easy to talk to. Researchers thought that pharmacists could give extra support to people with depression. This extra support could help people understand their medicine better and encourage them to keep taking it.

This study was done to find out if this idea is true. Researchers wanted to see if extra help from a pharmacist could improve the lives of people with depression. They wanted to know if this support helps reduce feelings of depression. They also wanted to know if it helps people take their medicine as prescribed.

**Trial Design**

This was a special kind of study called a review. The researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they gathered and studied the results from other studies that were already finished. This helps to get a stronger and more reliable answer by looking at a lot of information at once.

The researchers looked for studies that compared two groups of adults with depression.

*   One group of people got extra help and support from a pharmacist. This support might have been one-on-one talks, phone calls to check in, or extra education about their depression medicine.
*   The other group got the usual care. This is the normal support a person gets from their doctor or pharmacist. This might include a printed information sheet about their medicine or a very brief chat.

The researchers searched for studies from all over the world. They found 12 studies that fit what they were looking for. In total, these 12 studies included the results from over 2,200 people who were 16 years or older and had depression. By combining the results from all these people, the researchers could look for overall patterns.

**Results**

The researchers looked at the combined results to answer their main questions.

First, did the extra help from a pharmacist make people’s depression symptoms better? The study found no difference. The people who got extra help from a pharmacist did not feel better than the people who got the usual care. Their feelings of depression did not improve more than the other group.

Second, did the extra support help people take their medicine as prescribed? The answer here was yes. The results showed that people who got extra help from a pharmacist were more likely to keep taking their medicine correctly. This is an important benefit. Taking medicine as planned gives it the best chance to work over the long term.

The researchers also looked at other things. They wanted to know if people liked the extra support from the pharmacist. The results were not clear on this. It seemed that there was no real difference in how much people liked the extra help compared to the usual care.

Finally, the study looked at any bad side effects from the medicine. There was no difference in side effects between the groups. The extra support from the pharmacist did not cause any more problems.

In conclusion, this review found that extra support from a pharmacist can help people with depression stick to their medicine plan. But this support does not seem to directly make the symptoms of depression go away. This is useful information. It shows that pharmacists can play a key role in helping people manage their treatment, even if it is just one part of their overall care for depression.","Pharmacies might be able to support people with their depression medicines
Background 
Some people with depression find it difficult to take their depression medicines (often called 'antidepressants') as prescribed by their doctor. This can mean that the medicines do not work properly and people might not get better or might even get worse. It could be that pharmacists and their teams can help people with their depression treatment in ways that their family doctor (general practitioner (GP)) cannot. Pharmacies are based within the community, easier to get to, and people may feel more comfortable telling a pharmacist about their mood. However, there are not many studies to tell us if this works. 
Study characteristics 
We searched medical databases for well‐designed studies that compared a group of adults with depression who received additional help with their depression medicines from their pharmacy with a group of adults with depression who received their treatment as usual. 
The evidence is current to 14 December 2018.
Key results and certainty of the evidence 
We found 12 studies with over 2000 adults taking part. They compared pharmacy‐based support with treatment as usual, for example, basic information about their medicines or signposting to other services only. We found that additional support given by the pharmacist was no better at reducing people's depression than their treatment as usual. The studies also showed that people may have liked both approaches the same, although we are uncertain about the results as the evidence was of low certainty. 
The studies did show that people who received support from their pharmacy were more likely to take their antidepressants as prescribed. We were not able to combine information from the included studies on other outcomes we were interested in (diagnosis of depression, frequency of healthcare appointments, quality of life, social functioning, or side effects). 
We found no difference in effectiveness when people with depression received additional support from a pharmacist compared with treatment as usual.

Surgery is the cornerstone in curative treatment of colorectal cancer. Unfortunately, surgery itself can adversely affect patient health. 'Enhanced Recovery After Surgery' programmes, which include multimodal interventions, have improved patient outcomes substantially. However, these are mainly applied peri‐ and postoperatively. Multimodal prehabilitation includes multiple preoperative interventions to prepare patients for surgery with the aim of increasing resilience, thereby improving postoperative outcomes. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of multimodal prehabilitation programmes on functional capacity, postoperative complications, and quality of life in adult patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO in January 2021. We also searched trial registries up to March 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adult patients with non‐metastatic colorectal cancer, scheduled for surgery, comparing multimodal prehabilitation programmes (defined as comprising at least two preoperative interventions) with no prehabilitation. We focused on the following outcomes: functional capacity (i.e. 6‐minute walk test, VO2peak, handgrip strength), postoperative outcomes (i.e. complications, mortality, length of hospital stay, emergency department visits, re‐admissions), health‐related quality of life, compliance, safety of prehabilitation, and return to normal activities. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. Any disagreements were solved with discussion and consensus. We pooled data to perform meta‐analyses, where possible. 
Main results
We included three RCTs that enrolled 250 participants with non‐metastatic colorectal cancer, scheduled for elective (mainly laparoscopic) surgery. Included trials were conducted in tertiary care centres and recruited patients during periods ranging from 17 months to 45 months. A total of 130 participants enrolled in a preoperative four‐week trimodal prehabilitation programme consisting of exercise, nutritional intervention, and anxiety reduction techniques. Outcomes of these participants were compared to those of 120 participants who started an identical but postoperative programme. 
Postoperatively, prehabilitation may improve functional capacity, determined with the 6‐minute walk test at four and eight weeks (mean difference (MD) 26.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐13.81 to 65.85; 2 studies; n = 131; and MD 26.58, 95% CI ‐8.88 to 62.04; 2 studies; n = 140); however, the certainty of evidence is low and very low, respectively, due to serious risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency. After prehabilitation, the functional capacity before surgery improved, with a clinically relevant mean difference of 24.91 metres (95% CI 11.24 to 38.57; 3 studies; n = 225). The certainty of evidence was moderate due to downgrading for serious risk of bias. Prehabilitation may also result in fewer complications (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.29; 3 studies; n = 250) and fewer emergency department visits (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.32; 3 studies; n = 250). The certainty of evidence was low due to downgrading for serious risk of bias and imprecision. On the other hand, prehabilitation may also result in a higher re‐admission rate (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.65; 3 studies; n = 250). The certainty of evidence was again low due to downgrading for risk of bias and imprecision. The effect on VO2peak, handgrip strength, length of hospital stay, mortality rate, health‐related quality of life, return to normal activities, safety of the programme, and compliance rate could not be analysed quantitatively due to missing or insufficient data. The included studies did not report a difference between groups for health‐related quality of life and length of hospital stay. Data on remaining outcomes were not reported or were reported inadequately in the included studies. 
Authors' conclusions
Prehabilitation may result in an improved functional capacity, determined with the 6‐minute walk test both preoperatively and postoperatively. Complication rates and the number of emergency department visits postoperatively may also diminish due to a prehabilitation programme, while the number of re‐admissions may be higher in the prehabilitation group. The certainty of evidence ranges from moderate to very low, due to downgrading for serious risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency. In addition, only three heterogeneous studies were included in this review. Therefore, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. Numerous relevant RCTs are ongoing and will be included in a future update of this review.

Getting Your Body Ready for Bowel Cancer Surgery

### **Rationale**

**What is bowel cancer?**
Bowel cancer, also called colorectal cancer, is a cancer that starts in the large bowel. For many people with this cancer, surgery is the main treatment to try and cure it. Surgery can be very successful.

**Why is surgery a challenge?**
Even though surgery can remove the cancer, it is very hard on the body. It can take a long time for a person to feel strong and healthy again after an operation. Doctors have programs to help people get better after surgery, but they want to find more ways to help.

**Why was this study done?**
This study looked at a new idea to help people prepare for surgery. This idea is called ""prehabilitation."" It means getting a person’s body ready *before* their operation. The main idea was to see if helping people get stronger before surgery could help them heal better and have fewer problems afterward.

The researchers believed that a program of exercise, healthy eating, and stress-reduction before surgery could make patients more resilient. This could lead to a faster and safer recovery. They wanted to review all the best research available to see if this idea was true.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**
This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of three older studies and combined their findings. This type of study is called a review. It helps give a stronger answer than just one study alone.

The studies they looked at were the best type, called ""randomised controlled trials."" This means patients in those studies were put into different groups by chance, which makes the results fairer.

**Who was in the studies?**
In total, 250 adults with bowel cancer were in these three studies. Their cancer had not spread to other parts of their body. All of them were scheduled to have surgery to remove the cancer.

**What did the patients do?**
The patients were split into two main groups.
*   One group of 130 people did a special 4-week program *before* their surgery. This program had three parts to help them get ready. It included an exercise plan, advice on healthy eating, and techniques to help them feel less anxious.
*   The other group of 120 people did the very same program. But they started their program only *after* their surgery was over.

By comparing these two groups, the researchers could see what difference the ""prehabilitation"" program made.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**
The researchers looked at how the two groups did after their surgery. They found a few key things.

People who did the program *before* surgery were more fit going into their operation. They were able to walk farther in a 6-minute test. After surgery, this group also *may* have been able to walk farther than the other group, but the researchers are not very sure about this.

The group that got ready for surgery *may* have had fewer health problems after their operation. They also *may* have had fewer visits to the emergency room. However, they also *may* have been more likely to need to go back to the hospital after first going home.

**How certain are these results?**
The researchers who did this review urge us to be careful with these results. They said the proof from these studies was ""low"" to ""very low."" This means we cannot be very confident in the results yet.

There were a few reasons for this. The studies they looked at had some flaws. They also did not include a very large number of people. Because of this, the researchers cannot say for sure that getting ready for surgery is better.

The review could not find enough information to see if the program helped with other important things. For example, they could not tell if it improved people's quality of life, overall strength, or how long they needed to stay in the hospital.

**What do the researchers conclude?**
Getting your body ready for surgery might help you be more fit before the operation. It may also lower the chance of some problems afterward. But it is not a perfect solution and might even increase the chance of returning to the hospital.

Because the proof is not very strong, we need more and better studies. Luckily, many new studies are happening now. In the future, researchers will add the results from these new studies to give us a much clearer answer.","Preparing a patient with bowel cancer for surgery with multiple interventions
Aim of this review 
The aim of this review is to find out whether multiple interventions introduced in the period prior to surgery for bowel cancer could prepare a patient by increasing the patient's overall fitness, and thus improve outcomes after surgery. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all available randomised controlled trials on this topic. 
Key messages 
Only three studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, information was not available for all outcomes and the overall certainty of evidence was very low to moderate. More and larger studies are needed to gather evidence on this topic. 
What was studied in the review? 
Surgery is often given to cure patients diagnosed with early stage bowel cancer. Surgery has a negative impact on the overall fitness of the patient. The energy level decreases, patients are more dependent in their daily living activities, and quality of life decreases. Furthermore, complications may occur after surgery causing a further decrease of fitness. Preoperative interventions, such as exercise programmes, nutritional advice and supplements, as well as mental support, may increase the fitness of the patient, prior to surgery. This concept is called prehabilitation. The impact of surgery is diminished and consequently results in faster and better recovery. Combining such preoperative interventions results in better preparation for surgery because each interventions may help to strengthen the effects of the others. The review authors aimed to study the effect of such multiple‐intervention preparation programmes before surgery for patients with bowel cancer. The review authors focused on these outcomes: physical fitness, number of complications after surgery, death rate, quality of life (assessed with questionnaires), length of stay in the hospital, number of emergency department visits, number of re‐admissions after surgery, safety of the programme and adherence to the programme. They compared groups with prehabilitation programmes to groups not receiving any preparation prior to surgery, other than standard care. 
Main results of this review 
The review authors found three studies with 250 participants with bowel cancer, without metastases, scheduled for surgery. Studies were conducted in Canada. A total of 130 participants followed four‐week prehabilitation programmes prior to surgery, which included exercises, nutritional advice and supplements, as well as techniques to reduce anxiety about their cancer and its treatment. Another 120 participants followed identical programmes, but only started them after the surgery, when they were discharged from hospital. 
Overall, the review authors did not find an improvement in either group of participants. The certainty of evidence was very low to moderate, mainly because of the small numbers of studies and participants included in the review. Physical fitness potentially improves and the number of complications and emergency department visits may diminish in patients receiving prehabilitation programmes prior to surgery. On the other hand, more re‐admissions to the hospital occurred after prehabilitation programmes. Because data on death rates, quality of life, length of stay in the hospital, safety of the programme and adherence to the programme was not complete or not reported, the review authors did not analyse these outcomes. Due to the mostly low or very low certainty of the evidence, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to January 2021 and also looked for unpublished, ongoing studies up to March 2021. In a future update of this review, many ongoing studies will likely have been completed, which can be included to collect more evidence on this subject.

Dialysis treatments weigh heavily on patients' physical and psychosocial health. Multiple studies have assessed the potential for exercise training to improve outcomes in adults undergoing dialysis. However, uncertainties exist in its relevance and sustainable benefits for patient‐important outcomes. This is an update of a review first published in 2011. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and safety of regular structured exercise training in adults undergoing dialysis on patient‐important outcomes including death, cardiovascular events, fatigue, functional capacity, pain, and depression. We also aimed to define the optimal prescription of exercise in adults undergoing dialysis. 
Search methods
In this update, we conducted a systematic search of the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 23 December 2020. The Register includes studies identified from CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov as well as kidney‐related journals and the proceedings of major kidney conferences. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs of any structured exercise programs of eight weeks or more in adults undergoing maintenance dialysis compared to no exercise or sham exercise. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed the search results for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Whenever appropriate, we performed random‐effects meta‐analyses of the mean difference in outcomes. The primary outcomes were death (any cause), cardiovascular events and fatigue. Secondary outcomes were health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), depression, pain, functional capacity, blood pressure, adherence to the exercise program, and intervention‐related adverse events. 
Main results
We identified 89 studies involving 4291 randomised participants, of which 77 studies (3846 participants) contributed to the meta‐analyses. Seven studies included adults undergoing peritoneal dialysis. Fifty‐six studies reported aerobic exercise interventions, 21 resistance exercise interventions and 19 combined aerobic and resistance training within the same study arm. The interventions lasted from eight weeks to two years and most often took place thrice weekly during dialysis treatments. A single study reported death and no study reported long‐term cardiovascular events. Five studies directly assessed fatigue, 46 reported HRQoL and 16 reported fatigue or pain through their assessment of HRQoL. Thirty‐five studies assessed functional capacity, and 21 reported resting peripheral blood pressure. Twelve studies reported adherence to exercise sessions, and nine reported exercise‐related adverse events. Overall, the quality of the included studies was low and blinding of the participants was generally not feasible due to the nature of the intervention. 
Exercise had uncertain effects on death, cardiovascular events, and the mental component of HRQoL due to the very low certainty of evidence. Compared with sham or no exercise, exercise training for two to 12 months may improve fatigue in adults undergoing dialysis, however, a meta‐analysis could not be conducted. Any exercise training for two to 12 months may improve the physical component of HRQoL (17 studies, 656 participants: MD 4.12, 95% CI 1.88 to 6.37 points on 100 points‐scale; I² = 49%; low certainty evidence). Any exercise training for two to 12 months probably improves depressive symptoms (10 studies, 441 participants: SMD ‐0.65, 95% CI ‐1.07 to ‐0.22; I² = 77%; moderate certainty evidence) and the magnitude of the effect may be greater when maintaining the exercise beyond four months (6 studies, 311 participants: SMD ‐0.30, 95% CI 0.14 to ‐0.74; I² = 71%). Any exercise training for three to 12 months may improve pain (15 studies, 872 participants: MD 5.28 95% CI ‐0.12 to 10.69 points on 100 points‐scale; I² = 63%: low certainty evidence) however, the 95% CI indicates that exercise training may make little or no difference in the level of pain. Any exercise training for two to six months probably improves functional capacity as it increased the distance reached during six minutes of walking (19 studies, 827 participants: MD 49.91 metres, 95% CI 37.22 to 62.59; I² = 34%; moderate certainty evidence) and the number of sit‐to‐stand cycles performed in 30 seconds (MD 2.33 cycles, 95% CI 1.71 to 2.96; moderate certainty evidence). There was insufficient evidence to assess the safety of exercise training for adults undergoing maintenance dialysis. The results were similar for aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and a combination of both aerobic and resistance exercise. 
Authors' conclusions
It is uncertain whether exercise training improves death, cardiovascular events, or the mental component of HRQoL in adults undergoing maintenance dialysis. Exercise training probably improves depressive symptoms, particularly when the intervention is maintained beyond four months. Exercise training is also likely to improve functional capacity. Low certainty evidence suggested that exercise training may improve fatigue, the physical component of quality of life, and pain. The safety of exercise training for adults undergoing dialysis remains uncertain.

Can Exercise Help People on Dialysis Feel Better? A Review of Past Studies

***

**Rationale**

**What is this summary about?**
This summary explains the results of a large review of studies. The review looked at whether planned exercise programs can help adults who get dialysis.

**Why is dialysis hard?**
People with kidneys that do not work well need a treatment called dialysis. Dialysis cleans the blood. This treatment can be very hard on a person’s body and feelings. People on dialysis can feel very tired. They can also feel sad or have pain. This can make daily life difficult.

**Why was this review needed?**
Doctors and researchers think that exercise might help people on dialysis. Many small studies have looked at this. But it was not clear if exercise really helped with important things like mood, strength, and overall health.

Researchers wanted to get a clearer answer. They looked at the results of many past studies all together. This helps them see if exercise is truly helpful and safe for people on dialysis.

***

**Trial Design**

**How was this review done?**
This was not a new study with its own patients. Instead, researchers gathered and reviewed all the past studies they could find on this topic. They looked for studies where adults on dialysis were chosen by chance to either do a planned exercise program or not do one.

The researchers found 89 studies to include in their review. These studies involved more than 4,000 adults who were on dialysis.

**What did people do in the studies?**
The exercise programs in the studies were different. Some people did exercises to help their heart, like walking or cycling. This is called aerobic exercise. Other people did strength training. Some did a mix of both types of exercise.

Most people exercised three times a week. The exercise programs lasted from as short as two months to as long as two years.

***

**Results**

**What were the main results of the review?**
The review looked at how exercise affected many parts of a person's health. The results showed that exercise has some benefits, but some things are still not clear.

**What probably got better with exercise?**
*   **Feeling less sad:** People who exercised probably had fewer feelings of sadness. The benefit seemed to be greater for people who exercised for more than four months.
*   **Being more active and stronger:** People who exercised probably got better at doing physical tasks. For example, they were able to walk farther in 6 minutes. They could also stand up from a chair more times in 30 seconds.

**What may have gotten better with exercise?**
The researchers were less sure about these results, but exercise may have helped in some ways.
*   **Feeling less tired:** Exercise may have helped people feel less tired.
*   **Overall physical health:** Exercise may have helped people feel better about their physical health.
*   **Pain:** The results on pain were not clear. Exercise may have helped a little, but it may also have made no difference.

**What was still unclear after the review?**
*   **Living longer or having fewer heart problems:** The review could not tell if exercise helped people live longer. It also could not tell if exercise prevented serious heart problems. There was not enough information from the studies to know for sure.
*   **Safety:** The studies did not report enough information about problems that happened during exercise. Because of this, the researchers could not be sure about how safe exercise is for all people on dialysis.

**What is the main message from this review?**
For adults on dialysis, doing a planned exercise program probably helps improve strength and mood. It may also help you feel less tired and improve your physical well-being.

However, we still need more research. Future studies should look at the long-term effects of exercise. They also need to pay close attention to safety to help doctors give the best advice.","Exercise training for adults receiving dialysis treatments
What is the issue? 
People undergoing dialysis treatments are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease and depression, have a lower quality of life and limited survival than the general population. Furthermore, many people undergoing dialysis have difficulty performing daily activities because they lack the physical capacity and strength to do so. Multiple trials have assessed the potential for exercise training to improve the condition of adults undergoing dialysis, but no consensus has been reached. 
What did we do? 
We searched the medical literature for all randomised trials that assessed structured exercise programs in people undergoing dialysis. We then assessed the quality of those studies and combined their results to draw conclusions regarding the effect of exercise training to improve aspects of physical and mental health that are important to patients undergoing dialysis. 
What did we find? 
We found 89 studies involving 4291 participants. The exercise training programs lasted from eight weeks to two years and most often took place three times a week during the dialysis treatment. We could not determine the impact of exercise training on death, cardiovascular events (such as a heart attack) or mental well‐being. Moderate certainty evidence suggested that exercise training of any type is likely to improve depressive symptoms in adults undergoing dialysis, particularly when the exercise was maintained for longer than four months. Moderate quality evidence also suggested that exercise training may improve people's capacity to perform activities and tasks through the improvement of their capacity to walk and the strength and endurance of their legs. Exercise training may also improve fatigue and the physical aspects of quality of life, but the quality of the evidence was low. We could not conclude on the effect of exercise training on a person's mental well‐being. 
ConclusionsExercise training for people undergoing maintenance dialysis is likely to improve depression and their capacity to perform activities and tasks. Exercise training may also improve fatigue and pain sightly. Exercise training may improve the physical aspects of quality of life, but it is unclear whether it improves a person's mental well‐being. It is unclear whether exercise training reduces the number of deaths or cardiovascular events.

Exercise training is commonly recommended for individuals with fibromyalgia. This review is one of a series of reviews about exercise training for fibromyalgia that will replace the review titled ""Exercise for treating fibromyalgia syndrome"", which was first published in 2002. 
Objectives
To evaluate the benefits and harms of mixed exercise training protocols that include two or more types of exercise (aerobic, resistance, flexibility) for adults with fibromyalgia against control (treatment as usual, wait list control), non exercise (e.g. biofeedback), or other exercise (e.g. mixed versus flexibility) interventions. Specific comparisons involving mixed exercise versus other exercises (e.g. resistance, aquatic, aerobic, flexibility, and whole body vibration exercises) were not assessed. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Thesis and Dissertations Abstracts, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), the Physiotherapy Evidence Databese (PEDro), Current Controlled Trials (to 2013), WHO ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to December 2017, unrestricted by language, to identify all potentially relevant trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia that compared mixed exercise interventions with other or no exercise interventions. Major outcomes were health‐related quality of life (HRQL), pain, stiffness, fatigue, physical function, withdrawals, and adverse events. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and the quality of evidence for major outcomes using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included 29 RCTs (2088 participants; 98% female; average age 51 years) that compared mixed exercise interventions (including at least two of the following: aerobic or cardiorespiratory, resistance or muscle strengthening exercise, and flexibility exercise) versus control (e.g. wait list), non‐exercise (e.g. biofeedback), and other exercise interventions. Design flaws across studies led to selection, performance, detection, and selective reporting biases. We prioritised the findings of mixed exercise compared to control and present them fully here. 
Twenty‐one trials (1253 participants) provided moderate‐quality evidence for all major outcomes but stiffness (low quality). With the exception of withdrawals and adverse events, major outcome measures were self‐reported and expressed on a 0 to 100 scale (lower values are best, negative mean differences (MDs) indicate improvement; we used a clinically important difference between groups of 15% relative difference). Results for mixed exercise versus control show that mean HRQL was 56 and 49 in the control and exercise groups, respectively (13 studies; 610 participants) with absolute improvement of 7% (3% better to 11% better) and relative improvement of 12% (6% better to 18% better). Mean pain was 58.6 and 53 in the control and exercise groups, respectively (15 studies; 832 participants) with absolute improvement of 5% (1% better to 9% better) and relative improvement of 9% (3% better to 15% better). Mean fatigue was 72 and 59 points in the control and exercise groups, respectively (1 study; 493 participants) with absolute improvement of 13% (8% better to 18% better) and relative improvement of 18% (11% better to 24% better). Mean stiffness was 68 and 61 in the control and exercise groups, respectively (5 studies; 261 participants) with absolute improvement of 7% (1% better to 12% better) and relative improvement of 9% (1% better to 17% better). Mean physical function was 49 and 38 in the control and exercise groups, respectively (9 studies; 477 participants) with absolute improvement of 11% (7% better to 15% better) and relative improvement of 22% (14% better to 30% better). Pooled analysis resulted in a moderate‐quality risk ratio for all‐cause withdrawals with similar rates across groups (11 per 100 and 12 per 100 in the control and intervention groups, respectively) (19 studies; 1065 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 1.51) with an absolute change of 1% (3% fewer to 5% more) and a relative change of 11% (28% fewer to 47% more). Across all 21 studies, no injuries or other adverse events were reported; however some participants experienced increased fibromyalgia symptoms (pain, soreness, or tiredness) during or after exercise. However due to low event rates, we are uncertain of the precise risks with exercise. Mixed exercise may improve HRQL and physical function and may decrease pain and fatigue; all‐cause withdrawal was similar across groups, and mixed exercises may slightly reduce stiffness. For fatigue, physical function, HRQL, and stiffness, we cannot rule in or out a clinically relevant change, as the confidence intervals include both clinically important and unimportant effects. 
We found very low‐quality evidence on long‐term effects. In eight trials, HRQL, fatigue, and physical function improvement persisted at 6 to 52 or more weeks post intervention but improvements in stiffness and pain did not persist. Withdrawals and adverse events were not measured. 
It is uncertain whether mixed versus other non‐exercise or other exercise interventions improve HRQL and physical function or decrease symptoms because the quality of evidence was very low. The interventions were heterogeneous, and results were often based on small single studies. Adverse events with these interventions were not measured, and thus uncertainty surrounds the risk of adverse events. 
Authors' conclusions
Compared to control, moderate‐quality evidence indicates that mixed exercise probably improves HRQL, physical function, and fatigue, but this improvement may be small and clinically unimportant for some participants; physical function shows improvement in all participants. Withdrawal was similar across groups. Low‐quality evidence suggests that mixed exercise may slightly improve stiffness. Very low‐quality evidence indicates that we are 'uncertain' whether the long‐term effects of mixed exercise are maintained for all outcomes; all‐cause withdrawals and adverse events were not measured. Compared to other exercise or non‐exercise interventions, we are uncertain about the effects of mixed exercise because we found only very low‐quality evidence obtained from small, very heterogeneous trials. Although mixed exercise appears to be well tolerated (similar withdrawal rates across groups), evidence on adverse events is scarce, so we are uncertain about its safety. We downgraded the evidence from these trials due to imprecision (small trials), selection bias (e.g. allocation), blinding of participants and care providers or outcome assessors, and selective reporting.

Does a Mix of Different Exercises Help People with Fibromyalgia?

### **Rationale**

Fibromyalgia is a long-term health problem. It can cause pain all over your body. It can also make you feel very tired and stiff. These symptoms can make it hard to do your daily activities.

Doctors often suggest exercise for people with fibromyalgia. But we need to be sure that exercise really helps. We also need to know which types of exercise are best.

This review looked at past studies on this topic. The researchers wanted to see if doing a mix of different exercises helps people with fibromyalgia. For example, a person might do walking, some light weight lifting, and stretching in the same program. The researchers believed this mix of exercises could help people feel better and live better lives.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of many past studies. This is called a review. A review helps us see what most studies on a topic have found.

The researchers found 29 good studies to include. These studies involved a total of over 2000 people. Almost all of the people in the studies were women. The average age was 51 years old. All of them had been told by a doctor that they have fibromyalgia.

In these studies, people were put into groups by chance. One group did a program with a mix of exercises. The other group, called the control group, did not exercise. They may have had their usual care or been on a wait list. By comparing the groups, researchers can see if the exercise made a real difference.

### **Results**

The review found that doing a mix of exercises probably helps people with fibromyalgia. This was true when they were compared to people who did not exercise.

Here is what the researchers found for people who did mixed exercise:

*   **Quality of Life:** People felt their overall quality of life was better.
*   **Pain and Fatigue:** People had less pain and felt less tired.
*   **Physical Function:** It was easier for people to do daily tasks like walking or climbing stairs. This seemed to improve for everyone.
*   **Stiffness:** Exercise may have helped a little with stiffness, but the researchers were less sure about this.

For many of these good effects, the improvement was small. This means that some people may not have felt a big change.

The researchers also looked at safety. About the same number of people dropped out of the exercise groups as the control groups. This suggests that most people were able to handle the exercise programs. No serious injuries were reported. Some people did say they felt more sore or tired after exercise. But the studies did not collect a lot of information on this, so we are not completely sure about all the risks.

The good effects on quality of life, tiredness, and physical function seemed to last for a while after the programs ended. However, the improvements in pain and stiffness did not seem to last.

In conclusion, a program with a mix of different exercises is likely helpful for people with fibromyalgia. It seems to help people move better and do more. It may also help with pain and fatigue, but these changes might be small. More research is needed to know about the long-term effects and to be sure about safety.","Mixed exercise programmes for adults with fibromyalgia
What is fibromyalgia and what is mixed exercise? 
Fibromyalgia is a condition causing chronic pain and soreness throughout the body. People with this condition often feel depressed, tired, and stiff, and have difficulty sleeping. Mixed exercise is defined as regular sessions of two or more types of exercise including aerobic (walking or cycling), strengthening (lifting weights or pulling against resistance bands), or flexibility (stretching) exercise. 
Study characteristics 
Reviewers searched for studies until December 2017, and found 29 studies (2088 people) conducted in 12 different countries. The average age of study participants was 51 years, and 98% were female. The average exercise programme was 14 weeks long with three sessions of 50 to 60 minutes per week. All exercise programmes were fully or partially supervised. Reviewers were most interested in comparing mixed exercise groups to control groups (19 studies; 1065 people). People in control groups either received no treatment or continued their usual care. 
Key results – mixed exercise vs control 
Each outcome below is measured on a scale that goes from 0 to 100, where lower scores are better. 
Health‐related quality of life (HRQL)  
After 5 to 26 weeks, people who exercised were 7% better (3% better to 11% better) or improved by 7 points on a 100 point scale. 
People who exercised rated their HRQL at 49 points.
People in the control group rated their HRQL at 56 points.
Pain  
After 5 to 26 weeks, people who exercised had 5% less pain (1% better to 9% better) or improved by 5 points on a 100 point scale. 
People who exercised rated their pain at 53 points.
People in the control group rated their pain at 58.6 points.
Tiredness  
After 14 to 24 weeks, people who exercised were 13% less tired (8% better to 18% better) or improved by 13 points on a 100 point scale 
People who exercised rated their tiredness at 59 points.
People in the control group rated their tiredness at 72 points.
Stiffness  
After 16 weeks, people who exercised were 7% less stiff (1% better 1 to 12% better) or improved by 7 points on a 100 point scale. 
People who exercised rated their stiffness at 61 points.
People in the control group rated their stiffness at 68 points.
Ability to do daily activities (physical function)  
After 8 to 24 weeks, people who exercised were 11% better (7% to 15%) or improved by 11 points on a 100 point scale. 
People who exercised rated their physical function at 38 points.
People in the control group rated their physical function at 49 points.
Harms ‐ Some participants experienced increased pain, soreness, or tiredness during or after exercise. Studies reported no injuries or other harms. However, reporting of harms was missing or incomplete in many studies. We are uncertain whether risk is increased with exercise. 
Leaving the study early – 11% of control participants left the study early compared with 12% of exercisers. 
Long‐term effects ‐ Analysis of long‐term effects of HRQL showed maintenance of mixed exercise effects at 6 to 12 weeks and at 13 to 26 weeks but not at 27 to 52 weeks. Very low‐quality evidence suggests that it is uncertain whether mixed exercises improve HRQL in the long term. Withdrawals and adverse events were not measured. 
Other ‐ Reviewers found no evidence that the benefits and harms of mixed exercise were any different from education programmes, cognitive‐behavioural training, biofeedback, medication, or other types of exercise. 
Conclusions and quality of evidence 
Mixed exercise may improve HRQL and the ability to do daily activities, may decrease pain and tiredness, and may be acceptable to individuals with fibromyalgia. Low‐quality evidence suggests that mixed exercise may slightly improve stiffness. When compared to other exercise or non‐exercise interventions, we are uncertain about the effects of mixed exercise. Although mixed exercise appears to be well tolerated (similar numbers of people leaving the study across groups), evidence on harms was scarce, so we are uncertain about its safety. Reviewers considered the quality of evidence to be low to moderate because of small numbers of people in the studies, some issues involving study design, and the low quality of results.

Miscarriage, defined as the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks’ gestation, is common with approximately 25% of women experiencing a miscarriage in their lifetime, and 15% to 20% of pregnancies ending in a miscarriage. Progesterone has an important role in maintaining a pregnancy, and supplementation with different progestogens in early pregnancy has been attempted to rescue a pregnancy in women with early pregnancy bleeding (threatened miscarriage), and to prevent miscarriages in asymptomatic women who have a history of three or more previous miscarriages (recurrent miscarriage). 
Objectives
To estimate the relative effectiveness and safety profiles for the different progestogen treatments for threatened and recurrent miscarriage, and provide rankings of the available treatments according to their effectiveness, safety, and side‐effect profile. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases up to 15 December 2020: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE(R), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness or safety of progestogen treatment for the prevention of miscarriage. Cluster‐randomised trials were eligible for inclusion. Randomised trials published only as abstracts were eligible if sufficient information could be retrieved. We excluded quasi‐ and non‐randomised trials. 
Data collection and analysis
At least two review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We performed pairwise meta‐analyses and indirect comparisons, where possible, to determine the relative effects of all available treatments, but due to the limited number of included studies only direct or indirect comparisons were possible. We estimated the relative effects for the primary outcome of live birth and the secondary outcomes including miscarriage (< 24 weeks of gestation), preterm birth (< 37 weeks of gestation), stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy, congenital abnormalities, and adverse drug events. Relative effects for all outcomes are reported separately by the type of miscarriage (threatened and recurrent miscarriage). We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
Our meta‐analysis included seven randomised trials involving 5,682 women, and all provided data for meta‐analysis. All trials were conducted in hospital settings. Across seven trials (14 treatment arms), the following treatments were used: three arms (21%) used vaginal micronized progesterone; three arms (21%) used dydrogesterone; one arm (7%) used oral micronized progesterone; one arm (7%) used 17‐α‐hydroxyprogesterone, and six arms (43%) used placebo. 
Women with threatened miscarriage  
Based on the relative effects from the pairwise meta‐analysis, vaginal micronized progesterone (two trials, 4090 women, risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.07, high‐certainty evidence), and dydrogesterone (one trial, 406 women, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.07, moderate‐certainty evidence) probably make little or no difference to the live birth rate when compared with placebo for women with threatened miscarriage. No data are available to assess the effectiveness of 17‐α‐hydroxyprogesterone or oral micronized progesterone for the outcome of live birth in women with threatened miscarriage. 
The pre‐specified subgroup analysis by number of previous miscarriages is only possible for vaginal micronized progesterone in women with threatened miscarriage. In women with no previous miscarriages and early pregnancy bleeding, there is probably little or no improvement in the live birth rate (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.04, high‐certainty evidence) when treated with vaginal micronized progesterone compared to placebo. However, for women with one or more previous miscarriages and early pregnancy bleeding, vaginal micronized progesterone increases the live birth rate compared to placebo (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.15, high‐certainty evidence). 
Women with recurrent miscarriage  
Based on the results from one trial (826 women) vaginal micronized progesterone (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.15, high‐certainty evidence) probably makes little or no difference to the live birth rate when compared with placebo for women with recurrent miscarriage. The evidence for dydrogesterone compared with placebo for women with recurrent miscarriage is of very low‐certainty evidence, therefore the effects remain unclear. No data are available to assess the effectiveness of 17‐α‐hydroxyprogesterone or oral micronized progesterone for the outcome of live birth in women with recurrent miscarriage. 
Additional outcomes  
All progestogen treatments have a wide range of effects on the other pre‐specified outcomes (miscarriage (< 24 weeks of gestation), preterm birth (< 37 weeks of gestation), stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy) in comparison to placebo for both threatened and recurrent miscarriage. Moderate‐ and low‐certainty evidence with a wide range of effects suggests that there is probably no difference in congenital abnormalities and adverse drug events with vaginal micronized progesterone for threatened (congenital abnormalities RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.46, moderate‐certainty evidence; adverse drug events RR 1.07 95% CI 0.81 to 1.39, moderate‐certainty evidence) or recurrent miscarriage (congenital abnormalities 0.75, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.85, low‐certainty evidence; adverse drug events RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.29, moderate‐certainty evidence) compared with placebo. There are limited data and very low‐certainty evidence on congenital abnormalities and adverse drug events for the other progestogens. 
Authors' conclusions
The overall available evidence suggests that progestogens probably make little or no difference to live birth rate for women with threatened or recurrent miscarriage. However, vaginal micronized progesterone may increase the live birth rate for women with a history of one or more previous miscarriages and early pregnancy bleeding, with likely no difference in adverse events. There is still uncertainty over the effectiveness and safety of alternative progestogen treatments for threatened and recurrent miscarriage.

Can a Hormone Treatment Help Prevent a Miscarriage?

### **Rationale**

A miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy before the 24th week. It is a common and often difficult experience. About 1 in 4 women will have a miscarriage at some point in their life.

The body makes a hormone called progesterone. This hormone is very important for a healthy pregnancy. For a long time, doctors have wondered if giving extra progesterone to women could help prevent a miscarriage.

There are different types of progesterone treatments. Doctors did not know which type might work best or which was safest. This study was done to look at all the research on these treatments. The goal was to find out if progesterone can help women have a healthy baby.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked for all the best studies that had already been done. This type of research is called a review. It helps combine the results from many studies to get a stronger answer.

The researchers looked for studies called ""randomized controlled trials."" In these trials, people are put into groups by chance. One group gets the real medicine. The other group gets a fake medicine with no active drug in it. This fake medicine is called a placebo. This design helps show if the real medicine truly works.

The researchers found 7 good studies to include. These studies involved more than 5,600 women who were in the hospital. The women in the studies had one of two problems. They either had bleeding in early pregnancy (called a threatened miscarriage), or they had a history of losing three or more pregnancies (called recurrent miscarriage).

The studies tested different kinds of progesterone. Some were pills taken by mouth. Others were soft pills or gels placed in the vagina. These were all compared to a placebo.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The researchers looked at the results for two different groups of women.

**For women with bleeding in early pregnancy:**
For most women who had bleeding, taking progesterone did not seem to increase their chance of having a baby compared to the placebo. But, the researchers found that it did help one specific group.

The treatment helped women who had bleeding in their current pregnancy *and* had lost one or more pregnancies in the past. For these women, using progesterone that is placed in the vagina did increase their chance of having a baby.

**For women who have had many miscarriages before:**
For women who had a history of many miscarriages but had no bleeding in their current pregnancy, progesterone did not seem to help. It did not increase their chance of having a baby compared to the placebo.

**Was the treatment safe?**
The study also looked at safety. For the progesterone placed in the vagina, there was no sign of an increased risk of birth defects or other bad side effects. There was not enough information to know about the safety of the other types of progesterone treatments.

**What did the researchers conclude?**
The researchers concluded that progesterone treatment does not help most women at risk of a miscarriage.

However, there is one group of women that it may help. This group includes women with bleeding in their current pregnancy who have also had a miscarriage before. For these women, progesterone placed in the vagina may improve the chance of a successful pregnancy. More research is needed to learn about the other types of progesterone.","Are progestogen treatments effective in preventing miscarriage?
We set out to find out which progestogen treatment is most effective, safe, and has fewer side‐effects for preventing miscarriage in women with threatened and with recurrent miscarriage, using evidence from randomised controlled trials. We looked at the number of women who went on to have a live birth, or miscarriage. 
What is the issue? 
Miscarriage is the most common cause of early pregnancy loss in the first 24 weeks and one of the most common complications in early pregnancy. An estimated 15% to 20% of pregnancies will end in a miscarriage, with 25% of women experiencing a miscarriage in their lifetime. Women can be at risk of a miscarriage if they experience early pregnancy bleeding, or if they have a history of previous miscarriages. 
Why is this important? 
Progesterone is an important pregnancy hormone that helps to maintain a pregnancy. A variety of different progesterone‐like treatments (known as progestogens) have been used to treat women with early pregnancy bleeding. They are also used to prevent miscarriage in women with a history of previous miscarriages. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness, safety, and side‐effects of the available progestogens for preventing miscarriage in these different groups of women. We wanted to find out which, if any, of the treatments is the most effective and safest. We collected and analysed all the relevant studies to answer this question. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence in December 2020 and identified seven studies involving 5,682 women. All women were managed in hospitals. Women were diagnosed with early pregnancy bleeding (known as threatened miscarriage), or had a history of three or more previous miscarriages (known as recurrent miscarriage). Four different progestogen treatments were used: vaginal micronized progesterone, oral dydrogesterone, oral micronized progesterone and 17‐α‐hydroxyprogesterone injected into muscle. In six of the studies the treatments were compared to inactive placebo. 
Three studies involved 4496 women with threatened miscarriage, some of whom had previously experienced a miscarriage. Overall, vaginal micronized progesterone (high‐quality evidence) and oral dydrogesterone (moderate‐quality evidence) made little difference to the number of women who went on to have a live birth when compared with placebo. We further studied the women who had experienced a previous miscarriage, were now presenting with a threatened miscarriage, and were given vaginal micronized progesterone or placebo. For women with one or more previous miscarriages, vaginal micronized progesterone increased the live birth rate compared to placebo (high‐quality evidence). Those women who had no previous miscarriages, but were now presenting with early pregnancy bleeding showed no improvement in live birth rate (high‐certainty evidence). 
For women with recurrent miscarriage, we based our findings on one study involving 826 women. Overall, vaginal micronized progesterone made little difference to the live birth rate when compared with placebo. The evidence for dydrogesterone compared with placebo for women with recurrent miscarriage is of very low‐certainty evidence, therefore the effects remain unclear. No data are available to assess the effectiveness of 17‐α‐hydroxyprogesterone or oral micronized progesterone for the outcome of live birth in women with recurrent miscarriage. 
From the available data, there are likely no differences in adverse events associated with vaginal micronized progesterone. There was no difference in birth defects and side effects with vaginal micronized progesterone when compared with placebo. There was not enough information about safety and birth defects for us to analyse for all the other treatments. 
What does this mean? 
The overall available evidence suggests that progestogens probably make little or no difference to live birth rate for women with threatened or recurrent miscarriage. Vaginal micronized progesterone may increase the live birth rate for women who are experiencing early pregnancy bleeding and have a history of one or more previous miscarriages, with likely no difference in adverse events. There is still uncertainty over the effectiveness and safety of alternative progestogen treatments for threatened and recurrent miscarriage.

10.1002-14651858.CD014955,"Background
Drowning is responsible for an estimated 320,000 deaths a year, and over 90% of drowning mortality occurs in low‐ to middle‐income countries (LMICs), with peak drowning rates among children aged 1 to 4 years. In this age group, mortality due to drowning is particularly common in rural settings and about 75% of drowning accidents happen in natural bodies of water close to the home. Providing adequate child supervision can protect children from drowning, and organized formal day care programs could offer a way to achieve this. 
Objectives
Primary objective 
• To assess the effects of day care programs for children under 6 years of age on drowning‐related mortality or morbidity, or on total drowning accidents (fatal and non‐fatal), in LMICs, compared to no day care programs or other drowning prevention interventions 
Secondary objectives 
• To assess the effects of day care programs in LMICs for children under 6 years of age on unsafe water exposure 
• To assess safety within these programs (e.g. transmission of infection within day care, physical or sexual abuse of children within day care) 
• To assess the incidence of unintentional injury within these programs
• To describe the cost‐effectiveness of such programs, in relation to averted drowning‐related mortality or morbidity 
Search methods
On November 23, 2019, and for an update on August 18, 2020, we searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, CENTRAL, ERIC, and CINAHL, as well as two trial registries. On December 16, 2019, and for an update on February 9, 2021, we searched 12 other resources, including websites of organizations that develop programs targeted to children. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized, quasi‐randomized, and non‐randomized controlled studies (with explicitly listed specific study design features) that implemented formal day care programs as a single program or combined with additional out‐of‐day care components (such as educational activities aimed at preventing injury or drowning or early childhood development activities) for children of preschool age (below 6 years of age) in LMICs for comparison with no such programs or with other drowning prevention interventions. Studies had to report at least one outcome related to drowning or injury prevention for the children enrolled. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed study selection and data extraction, as well as risk of bias and GRADE assessment. 
Main results
Two non‐randomized observational studies, conducted in rural Bangladesh, involving a total of 252,631 participants, met the inclusion criteria for this review. One of these studies compared a formal day care program combined with parent education, playpens provided to parents, and community‐based activities as additional out‐of‐day care components versus no such program. Overall we assessed this study to be at moderate risk of bias (moderate risk of bias due to confounding, low risk of bias for other domains). This study showed that implementation of a formal day care program combined with parent education, provision of playpens to parents, and community‐based activities, in a rural area with a high drowning incidence, likely reduces the risk of death from drowning over the study period of 4 years and 8 months compared to no day care program (hazard ratio 0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06 to 0.58; 1 study, 136,577 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Drowning morbidity (non‐fatal drowning resulting in complications), total drowning (fatal and non‐fatal), unsafe water exposure, and program safety (e.g. transmission of infection within day care, physical or sexual abuse of children within day care) were not reported, nor was the incidence of other unintentional injuries. Cost‐effectiveness was reported as 812 USD (95% CI 589 to 1777) per disability‐adjusted life‐year averted as a consequence of drowning (moderate‐certainty evidence). The second study compared day care programs with or without playpens provided to parents as an additional component versus only playpens provided to parents as an alternative drowning prevention intervention. Overall we assessed the study to be at critical risk of bias because we judged bias due to confounding to be at critical risk. As the certainty of evidence was very low, we are uncertain about the effects on drowning mortality rate of implementing a day care program compared to providing playpens (rate ratio 0.25, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41; 1 study; 76,575 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Likewise, we are uncertain about the effects of a day care program with playpens provided as an additional component versus playpens provided alone (rate ratio 0.06, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.12; 1 study, 45,460 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The other outcomes of interest ‐ drowning morbidity, total drowning, unsafe water exposure, program safety, incidence of other unintentional injuries, and cost‐effectiveness ‐ were not reported. 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides evidence suggesting that a day care program with additional out‐of‐day care components such as community‐based education, parent education, and playpens provided to parents likely reduces the drowning mortality risk in regions with a high burden of drowning compared to no intervention.

Can Day Care Programs Help Keep Young Children Safe from Drowning?

**Rationale**

Drowning is a very serious problem all over the world. It is one of the main causes of death for young children, especially those between 1 and 4 years old. Sadly, most of these deaths happen in countries with fewer resources.

Many of these drownings happen in rural areas, away from big cities. A small child can quickly and quietly fall into a pond, a ditch, or a river that is close to their home. This is a great burden for families and communities.

One of the best ways to protect children is to watch them closely. This study looked at one way to do this. The idea was to use organized day care centers. These centers could provide a safe place for children to play and learn while being watched by trusted adults. Researchers wanted to find out if day care programs really do help prevent drowning for children under the age of 6.

**Trial Design**

To find an answer, the researchers did a review. This means they did not do a new study with new patients. Instead, they searched for and collected all the studies that had already been done on this topic. Bringing old studies together can give a stronger answer to a research question.

The researchers looked for studies that tested day care programs for children younger than 6 years old. The studies had to take place in countries with fewer resources. The goal was to see if these programs helped prevent drowning or other injuries.

After a wide search, the researchers found two studies that fit their needs. Both studies were done in rural parts of the country of Bangladesh. Together, these two studies included information on over 250,000 children.

**Results**

The two studies that the researchers looked at had different findings.

The first study tested a day care program that was combined with other safety actions. This program also taught parents about safety. It gave families playpens to create a safe space for their child at home. And it held safety events for the whole community. This study followed children for nearly 5 years.

The results of this first study were positive. It found that children in this program were much less likely to die from drowning compared to children who were not in the program. The researchers are fairly sure about this result. The study also looked at the cost of the program. It found that the money spent was a good value for saving children’s lives and preventing serious harm. This study did not report on drownings where the child survived, or on other types of injuries.

The second study compared a day care program to just giving families a playpen. However, the way this study was done made it hard for the researchers to trust the results. For example, the groups of children being compared might have been different in other important ways. These differences could affect the results. Because of this, the researchers are very unsure about what this study tells us. We cannot say if day care was better than only using a playpen.

In the end, what did the researchers conclude? Based on the stronger first study, they think that day care programs likely help reduce the risk of death from drowning. These programs seem to work best when they also include other safety steps. These steps should include teaching parents and communities about safety and providing tools like playpens. This is very important in areas where young children are at a high risk of drowning.","Can day care programs for children under 6 years of age in low‐ to middle‐income countries reduce their risk of drowning? 
Key message 
A day care program with extra features such as community‐based education, parent education, and playpens provided to parents outside the day care facility probably reduces the risk of death by drowning for children under 6 years living in areas where large numbers of children drown each year. 
Why did we do this Cochrane Review? 
Children living in rural areas near open water are at risk of drowning, particularly if they are not attending school or are left unsupervised. Child supervision is recommended to prevent drowning accidents, and organized day care at a center outside the home could help. 
We wanted to know if a day care program for children under 6 years of age in low‐ to middle‐income countries might help to reduce the number of drowning accidents (fatal and non‐fatal). 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at the effects of a day care program on drowning accidents in children under 6 years of age. The day care program could include features such as educational activities aimed at preventing injuries or drowning and early childhood development activities. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We included evidence published up to August 18, 2020.
What did we find? 
We found 2 studies that involved 252,631 children and took place in rural Bangladesh.
One study lasted 4 years and 8 months. It assessed the effects of a day care program that combined parent education, playpens provided to parents, and community education as compared to the effects of no day care program. 
The other study lasted 3 years and 4 months. The effects of a day care program alone and the effects of a combined program of day care with playpens provided to parents were each compared with the effects of only playpens provided to parents. 
What are the main results of our review? 
Compared with no day care program, a day care program for children under 6 years of age, combined with parent education, playpens for parents, and community education, probably reduces the risk of death from drowning (evidence from 1 study in 136,577 children). For every 100,000 children under 6 years of age who were not in the day care program, 77 children might die from drowning, compared with 14 children included in the day care program. 
Providing this day care program with additional activities was cheaper than the cost of every year lost to illness, disability, or early death by drowning (evidence from 1 study in 136,577 children). 
We are uncertain about the effects of a day care program when compared with playpens provided to parents, and we are uncertain about the effects of a day care program combined with playpens for parents when compared with playpens alone. 
Neither study reported results on non‐fatal drowning accidents, unsafe water exposure, the safety of the program, or other accidental injuries. 
Limitations of the evidence 
The results were from two observational studies in which researchers observed the effects of a factor (such as a day care program) without trying to change who did, or did not, experience it. Evidence from observational studies is not as reliable as evidence from randomized controlled studies, in which the programs people receive are decided at random. 
We are moderately confident about the effects of a day care program (with extra features) on the risk of death by drowning in children under 6 years of age. Further research is likely to increase our confidence in these results.

Asthma is a respiratory disease characterised by variable airflow limitation and the presence of respiratory symptoms including wheeze, chest tightness, cough and/or dyspnoea. Exercise training is beneficial for people with asthma; however, the response to conventional models of pulmonary rehabilitation is less clear. 
Objectives
To evaluate, in adults with asthma, the effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation compared to usual care on exercise performance, asthma control, and quality of life (co‐primary outcomes), incidence of severe asthma exacerbations/hospitalisations, mental health, muscle strength, physical activity levels, inflammatory biomarkers, and adverse events. 
Search methods
We identified studies from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, from their inception to May 2021, as well as the reference lists of all primary studies and review articles. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials in which pulmonary rehabilitation was compared to usual care in adults with asthma. Pulmonary rehabilitation must have included a minimum of four weeks (or eight sessions) aerobic training and education or self‐management. Co‐interventions were permitted; however, exercise training alone was not.  
Data collection and analysis
Following the use of Cochrane's Screen4Me workflow, two review authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, extracted study characteristics and outcome data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We contacted study authors to retrieve missing data. We calculated between‐group effects via mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) using a random‐effects model. We evaluated the certainty of evidence using GRADE methodology. 
Main results
We included 10 studies involving 894 participants (range 24 to 412 participants (n = 2 studies involving n > 100, one contributing to meta‐analysis), mean age range 27 to 54 years). We identified one ongoing study and three studies awaiting classification. One study was synthesised narratively, and another involved participants specifically with asthma‐COPD overlap. Most programmes were outpatient‐based, lasting from three to four weeks (inpatient) or eight to 12 weeks (outpatient). Education or self‐management components included breathing retraining and relaxation, nutritional advice and psychological counselling. One programme was specifically tailored for people with severe asthma.  
Pulmonary rehabilitation compared to usual care may increase maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) after programme completion, but the evidence is very uncertain for data derived using mL/kg/min (MD between groups of 3.63 mL/kg/min, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.48 to 5.77; 3 studies; n = 129) and uncertain for data derived from % predicted VO2 max (MD 14.88%, 95% CI 9.66 to 20.1%; 2 studies; n = 60). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation compared to usual care on incremental shuttle walk test distance (MD between groups 74.0 metres, 95% CI 26.4 to 121.4; 1 study; n = 30). Pulmonary rehabilitation may have little to no effect on VO2 max at longer‐term follow up (9 to 12 months), but the evidence is very uncertain (MD −0.69 mL/kg/min, 95% CI −4.79 to 3.42; I2 = 49%; 3 studies; n = 66). 
Pulmonary rehabilitation likely improves functional exercise capacity as measured by 6‐minute walk distance, with MD between groups after programme completion of 79.8 metres (95% CI 66.5 to 93.1; 5 studies; n = 529; moderate certainty evidence). This magnitude of mean change exceeds the minimally clinically important difference (MCID) threshold for people with chronic respiratory disease. The evidence is very uncertain about the longer‐term effects one year after pulmonary rehabilitation for this outcome (MD 52.29 metres, 95% CI 0.7 to 103.88; 2 studies; n = 42). 
Pulmonary rehabilitation may result in a small improvement in asthma control compared to usual care as measured by Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), with an MD between groups of −0.46 (95% CI −0.76 to −0.17; 2 studies; n = 93; low certainty evidence); however, data derived from the Asthma Control Test were very uncertain (MD between groups 3.34, 95% CI −2.32 to 9.01; 2 studies; n = 442). The ACQ finding approximates the MCID of 0.5 points. Pulmonary rehabilitation results in little to no difference in asthma control as measured by ACQ at nine to 12 months follow‐up (MD 0.09, 95% CI −0.35 to 0.53; 2 studies; n = 48; low certainty evidence). 
Pulmonary rehabilitation likely results in a large improvement in quality of life as assessed by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score (MD −18.51, 95% CI −20.77 to −16.25; 2 studies; n = 440; moderate certainty evidence), with this magnitude of change exceeding the MCID. However, pulmonary rehabilitation may have little to no effect on Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) total scores, with the evidence being very uncertain (MD 0.87, 95% CI −0.13 to 1.86; 2 studies; n = 442). Longer‐term follow‐up data suggested improvements in quality of life may occur as measured by SGRQ (MD −13.4, 95% CI −15.93 to −10.88; 2 studies; n = 430) but not AQLQ (MD 0.58, 95% CI −0.23 to 1.38; 2 studies; n = 435); however, the evidence is very uncertain. 
One study reported no difference between groups in the proportion of participants who experienced an asthma exacerbation during the intervention period. Data from one study suggest adverse events attributable to the intervention are rare.  
Overall risk of bias was most commonly impacted by performance bias attributed to a lack of participant blinding to knowledge of the intervention. This is inherently challenging to overcome in rehabilitation studies.  
Authors' conclusions
Moderate certainty evidence shows that pulmonary rehabilitation is probably associated with clinically meaningful improvements in functional exercise capacity and quality of life upon programme completion in adults with asthma. The certainty of evidence relating to maximal exercise capacity was very low to low. Pulmonary rehabilitation appears to confer minimal effect on asthma control, although the certainty of evidence is very low to low. Unclear reporting of study methods and small sample sizes limits our certainty in the overall body of evidence, whilst heterogenous study designs and interventions likely contribute to inconsistent findings across clinical outcomes and studies. There remains considerable scope for future research.

Can an exercise and learning program help adults with asthma?

**Rationale**
Asthma is a long-term lung problem. It can make the airways in your lungs swell up. This makes it hard to breathe. People with asthma might wheeze, cough, or feel a tightness in their chest. These symptoms can make daily life and activities difficult.

Doctors know that exercise is good for people with asthma. This study looked at a special program called pulmonary rehabilitation. This program combines exercise with learning sessions. It is made to help people with lung conditions.

Researchers wanted to see if this special program could help adults with asthma more than the usual care they get from their doctor. They thought the program could help people get stronger, breathe better, and improve their daily lives. This study was needed because it was not clear how well these programs work for people with asthma.

**Trial Design**
This was a review study. This means the researchers looked for and combined the results of other studies that were already completed. They found 10 studies to include.

These studies involved about 900 adults who had asthma. The people in the studies were between 27 and 54 years old on average.

In each study, people were put into two groups by chance.
*   One group took part in the pulmonary rehabilitation program.
*   The other group got their usual care from their doctor. Usual care is the regular advice and medicine a person gets for their asthma.

The special programs combined exercise and learning. The exercise part included activities like walking or cycling that make your heart beat faster. The learning part taught people how to manage their asthma. This included breathing skills, advice on healthy food, and ways to handle stress. The programs lasted for about 3 to 12 weeks.

**Results**
The researchers found that the special program probably helps adults with asthma feel better and get stronger.

People who did the program had big improvements in their ability to exercise. They could walk much farther in a 6-minute test. This was a real change that they would likely notice in their daily life. This shows the program helped them do daily tasks more easily.

The program also likely improved people’s quality of life. This means they felt that asthma had less of a bad effect on their mood and daily activities. For some people, this benefit lasted for up to one year after the program ended.

The results for other things were less clear. The program may have helped with asthma control, but the researchers are not very sure about this. They are also not sure if the program helped people exercise at their highest possible level.

The study leaders concluded that pulmonary rehabilitation is likely a good and safe treatment for adults with asthma. It helps people walk farther and have a better quality of life. However, the studies they looked at were small. This makes it hard to be certain about all the benefits. More and larger studies are needed to learn more.","What are the benefits of supervised programmes of exercise and education (known as pulmonary rehabilitation) compared with usual care for adults with asthma? 
Key messages  
‐ We found that people with asthma who take part in supervised programmes of exercise and education (known as pulmonary rehabilitation) are likely to get fitter (can walk further) and have better wellbeing immediately after completing these programmes compared to those who receive usual care. However, we are not certain if these benefits persist up to one year later. 
‐ Due to a lack of evidence, the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation on outcomes such as rates of asthma attacks or hospitalisations, anxiety and depression, or physical activity levels is unclear.  
‐ Larger, well‐designed studies are needed to better estimate the true benefit of pulmonary rehabilitation for adults with asthma. 
What is asthma? 
Asthma is a common lung disease where the breathing tubes can become inflamed and narrowed and may produce extra mucus. People with asthma can experience cough, wheezing, chest tightness, and breathlessness, with those most severely affected experiencing difficulty going about their everyday lives.  
Asthma cannot be cured, but symptoms can be controlled. Different medications can help keep symptoms under control, whilst physical exercise can also help. However, some people with asthma may find it challenging to undertake comprehensive exercise programmes. 
What is pulmonary rehabilitation? 
Supervised programmes of exercise and education (called pulmonary rehabilitation) are commonly used for people with chronic lung conditions and help improve breathing, fitness, and wellbeing. These programmes may be based at hospitals, outpatient clinics, or even at home.  
Pulmonary rehabilitation is a recommended standard of care for many chronic lung conditions; however, its effects in adults with asthma are less clear. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to see how pulmonary rehabilitation affects physical fitness, control of asthma symptoms, and wellbeing of adults with asthma compared to usual clinical care involving no pulmonary rehabilitation. We also wanted to learn how it affects the rate of severe asthma attacks/hospitalisations, mental health (anxiety and depression), muscle strength, physical activity levels, and markers of inflammation (in sputum or blood). Finally, we wanted to see whether it is associated with any unwanted effects.  
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared pulmonary rehabilitation to usual care in adults with asthma. Treatment must have lasted at least four weeks (or eight or more sessions) and must have included aerobic exercises (such as walking or cycling) and education or self‐management.  
We compared and summarised findings across all eligible studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and size. 
What did we find? 
‐ We found 10 studies involving 894 adults with asthma. 
‐ The studies ranged in size from 24 to 412 people. 
‐ Most studies were conducted in Europe. 
‐ Where reported, most study participants were female, with the average age ranging from 27 to 54 years.  
‐ One study specifically included people with severe forms of asthma. Another study specifically included people who had a condition involving overlapping features of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
‐ The way pulmonary rehabilitation was delivered varied across studies. Inpatient programmes lasted 3 to 4 weeks, whilst outpatient programmes lasted 8 to 12 weeks. 
‐ The specific nature of exercise or education components amongst the included studies varied widely. 
Main results 
‐ Pulmonary rehabilitation probably causes a large increase in physical fitness immediately after completion of the programme, resulting in an ability to walk an average of 80 metres further in 6 minutes than in people who receive usual care. There may be little to no effect on physical fitness measured up to one year later. 
‐ Pulmonary rehabilitation may result in small improvements in or little to no impact on asthma control immediately after completion of the programme or up to one year later compared to usual care.  
‐ Pulmonary rehabilitation probably causes a large improvement in wellbeing as measured by the St George’s Respiratory Disease Questionnaire immediately after completion of the programme. Results may differ slightly according to different quality of life instruments. The effects potentially last up to one year, but results are very uncertain. 
‐ Little to no effect on wellbeing was observed after programme completion or up to nine months follow‐up when the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire was used.  
‐ There was very limited evidence to determine the effect of pulmonary rehabilitation on rates of asthma attacks/hospitalisations, measures of anxiety and depression, limb muscle strength, levels of physical activity, or markers of inflammation in the blood or sputum.  
‐ Data from one study suggested pulmonary rehabilitation resulted in no direct unwanted or harmful effects. 
Limitations of the evidence  
Our confidence in the evidence relating to outcomes such as physical fitness, wellbeing, and asthma control is limited due to concerns regarding unclear methods in some studies, the potential for participants or assessors (or both) to have influenced outcomes due to the awareness of assigned treatments, and the varied ways in which pulmonary rehabilitation was delivered. 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to May 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD012470.pub2,"Interventions for treating wrist fractures (broken wrists) in children
Background and aim 
Wrist fractures are the most common bone injury in children. Most are buckle (or torus) fractures, where the bone surface bulges out. These minor fractures heal well. They are often treated with a wrist splint or a below‐elbow plaster cast.  More serious fractures are where the bone breaks, generally resulting in displacement of the bone parts. Usually the bone is manipulated back into place ('reduction'), followed by cast immobilisation, often with an above‐elbow cast including the elbow. When considered, surgery generally involves placing wires through the skin and into the bone (percutaneous wiring). 
We aimed to assess the best‐quality evidence for different treatments of wrist fractures in children. 
Results of the search 
We searched medical databases up to May 2018 and included 30 studies with 2930 children. Studies included more male children and reported mean ages between eight and 10 years. We summarise the results from five key comparisons. 
Key results 
Six studies compared a removable splint with a below‐elbow cast for buckle fractures. One study found there may be little or no difference between the two devices in physical function at four weeks. Few children needed a change or reapplication of either splint or cast (4 studies). There were no refractures. We are uncertain whether there is any difference in pain during device use. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate time to return to former activities (recovery time), minor complications, and child or parent satisfaction. Two studies found lower healthcare costs for splints. 
Four studies compared a soft or elasticated bandage with a below‐elbow cast for buckle fractures. We are uncertain if there is less disability at four weeks after bandaging. Few children changed device or needed extended immobilisation (3 studies). There were no serious adverse events. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate recovery time, wrist pain, minor complications, and satisfaction. Children found the bandage more convenient (1 study). 
Two studies (mainly buckle fractures) compared cast removal at home by parents versus at the hospital fracture clinic by clinicians (a cast saw was not required for home removal). All had recovered function at four weeks (1 study). There were few treatment changes and no serious adverse effects. Recovery time and number of children with minor complications were not reported. There may be no difference in pain at four weeks (1 study). There may be greater parental satisfaction for cast removal at home (1 study). One study found lower healthcare costs for home removal. 
Four studies compared below‐elbow versus above‐elbow casts in usually displaced fractures. We are uncertain if children are less dependent on help when using below‐elbow casts. We are uncertain if there is a difference between the two casts in physical function at six months (1 study). We are uncertain about the finding that all children with above‐elbow casts needed another fracture reduction. There were no serious adverse events. Recovery time and minor complications were not reported. There may be little difference in needing physiotherapy for stiffness. Pain at one week may be less for below‐elbow casts (1 study). One study found lower healthcare costs for below‐elbow casts. 
Five studies compared percutaneous wiring and above‐elbow cast immobilisation versus above‐elbow cast immobilisation alone after closed reduction of displaced fractures. Short‐term physical function was not reported. There may be no between‐group difference in function at six months (1 study). We are uncertain whether surgery reduces the risk of treatment failure, defined as early or difficult removal of wires, and remanipulation for loss in position. We are uncertain whether there are fewer serious adverse events with surgery. Recovery time, wrist pain, and satisfaction were not reported. There may be less need for physiotherapy after surgery. One USA study found treatment costs were similar. 
Quality of the evidence 
All 30 studies had weaknesses that could affect the reliability of their results. We considered the evidence for all outcomes to be low or very low quality. 
Conclusion 
There is not enough evidence to determine the best ways of treating different types of wrist fractures in children. However, the review findings are consistent with the move away from cast immobilisation for buckle fractures.

Finding the Best Way to Treat a Broken Wrist in Children

### **Rationale**

A broken wrist is the most common bone break that children get. Many of these are small breaks called ""buckle"" fractures. This is when the bone just bends or bumps out a little. These small breaks heal well.

More serious breaks happen when the bone snaps and the pieces move out of place. For these breaks, a doctor often has to gently push the bone back into place. Then, the child wears a hard cast to keep the bone from moving while it heals. Sometimes, doctors may do surgery to hold the bone together with wires.

Doctors use many different treatments for broken wrists in children. This study was done to look at past research. The goal was to find out which treatments work best to help children heal and get back to their normal lives.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of 30 older studies. This is called a review. It helps combine information from many studies to get a better answer.

The 30 studies included a total of 2930 children with broken wrists. Most of the children in the studies were boys. Their average age was between 8 and 10 years old. The studies checked on how the children were doing for several weeks or months after their injury.

### **Results**

The researchers found that the old studies were not of high quality. This means it is hard to be sure about the results. But here is what they found when they compared different treatments.

**For small ""buckle"" breaks:**

*   **Splint vs. Hard Cast:** Six studies looked at this. There was little or no difference in how well the children could use their wrists after four weeks. Both treatments worked well. Using a splint cost less than using a cast.
*   **Soft Bandage vs. Hard Cast:** Four studies looked at this. It was not clear if a bandage was better than a cast for helping the wrist heal. But children said the bandage was more comfortable and easy to use.
*   **Taking a Cast off at Home vs. at the Hospital:** Two studies looked at this. The casts were the type that do not need a saw to be removed. Children healed well no matter where the cast was taken off. Parents were happier when they could take the cast off at home. It also cost less to do it at home.

**For more serious breaks:**

*   **Short Cast vs. Long Cast:** A short cast stops below the elbow. A long cast goes above the elbow. Four studies looked at this. The researchers were not sure if one was better than the other for helping children use their arm. A short cast may cause less pain. It also might cost less.
*   **Surgery with Wires plus a Cast vs. Just a Cast:** Five studies looked at this. It was not clear if having surgery with wires helped children heal better or faster. It was also not clear if surgery led to fewer problems.

**What this means for patients:**

There is not enough good proof to say for sure what is the best way to treat every type of broken wrist in a child.

However, the results of this review support what many doctors are already doing. For simple buckle fractures, children seem to do just as well with a simple splint or bandage as they do with a heavy, hard cast. This can be more comfortable for the child and cost less. More research is needed to find the best treatments for more serious breaks.","Interventions for treating wrist fractures (broken wrists) in children

10.1002-14651858.CD013404.pub2,"Background
Hip fractures are a major healthcare problem, presenting a considerable challenge and burden to individuals and healthcare systems. The number of hip fractures globally is rising rapidly. The majority of intracapsular hip fractures are treated surgically. 
Objectives
To assess the relative effects (benefits and harms) of all surgical treatments used in the management of intracapsular hip fractures in older adults, using a network meta‐analysis of randomised trials, and to generate a hierarchy of interventions according to their outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and five other databases in July 2020. We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, reference lists of retrieved articles and conducted backward‐citation searches. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing different treatments for fragility intracapsular hip fractures in older adults. We included total hip arthroplasties (THAs), hemiarthroplasties (HAs), internal fixation, and non‐operative treatments. We excluded studies of people with hip fracture with specific pathologies other than osteoporosis or resulting from high‐energy trauma. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. One review author completed data extraction which was checked by a second review author. We collected data for three outcomes at different time points: mortality and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) ‐ both reported within 4 months, at 12 months, and after 24 months of surgery, and unplanned return to theatre (at end of study follow‐up). 
We performed a network meta‐analysis (NMA) with Stata software, using frequentist methods, and calculated the differences between treatments using risk ratios (RRs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We also performed direct comparisons using the same codes. 
Main results
We included 119 studies (102 RCTS, 17 quasi‐RCTs) with 17,653 participants with 17,669 intracapsular fractures in the review; 83% of fractures were displaced. The mean participant age ranged from 60 to 87 years and 73% were women.  
After discussion with clinical experts, we selected 12 nodes that represented the best balance between clinical plausibility and efficiency of the networks: cemented modern unipolar HA, dynamic fixed angle plate, uncemented first‐generation bipolar HA, uncemented modern bipolar HA, cemented modern bipolar HA, uncemented first‐generation unipolar HA, uncemented modern unipolar HA, THA with single articulation, dual‐mobility THA, pins, screws, and non‐operative treatment. Seventy‐five studies (with 11,855 participants) with data for at least two of these treatments contributed to the NMA. 
We selected cemented modern unipolar HA as a reference treatment against which other treatments were compared. This was a common treatment in the networks, providing a clinically appropriate comparison. In order to provide a concise summary of the results, we report only network estimates when there was evidence of difference between treatments. 
We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for serious and very serious risks of bias and when estimates included possible transitivity, particularly for internal fixation which included more undisplaced fractures. We also downgraded for incoherence, or inconsistency in indirect estimates, although this affected few estimates. Most estimates included the possibility of benefits and harms, and we downgraded the evidence for these treatments for imprecision.  
We found that cemented modern unipolar HA, dynamic fixed angle plate and pins seemed to have the greatest likelihood of reducing mortality at 12 months. Overall, 23.5% of participants who received the reference treatment died within 12 months of surgery. Uncemented modern bipolar HA had higher mortality than the reference treatment (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.85; derived only from indirect evidence; low‐certainty evidence), and THA with single articulation also had higher mortality (network estimate RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.32; derived from direct evidence from 2 studies with 225 participants, and indirect evidence; very low‐certainty evidence). In the remaining treatments, the certainty of the evidence ranged from low to very low, and we noted no evidence of any differences in mortality at 12 months.  
We found that THA (single articulation), cemented modern bipolar HA and uncemented modern bipolar HA seemed to have the greatest likelihood of improving HRQoL at 12 months. This network was comparatively sparse compared to other outcomes and the certainty of the evidence of differences between treatments was very low. We noted no evidence of any differences in HRQoL at 12 months, although estimates were imprecise. 
We found that arthroplasty treatments seemed to have a greater likelihood of reducing unplanned return to theatre than internal fixation and non‐operative treatment. We estimated that 4.3% of participants who received the reference treatment returned to theatre during the study follow‐up. Compared to this treatment, we found low‐certainty evidence that more participants returned to theatre if they were treated with a dynamic fixed angle plate (network estimate RR 4.63, 95% CI 2.94 to 7.30; from direct evidence from 1 study with 190 participants, and indirect evidence). We found very low‐certainty evidence that more participants returned to theatre when treated with pins (RR 4.16, 95% CI 2.53 to 6.84; only from indirect evidence), screws (network estimate RR 5.04, 95% CI 3.25 to 7.82; from direct evidence from 2 studies with 278 participants, and indirect evidence), and non‐operative treatment (RR 5.41, 95% CI 1.80 to 16.26; only from indirect evidence). There was very low‐certainty evidence of a tendency for an increased risk of unplanned return to theatre for all of the arthroplasty treatments, and in particular for THA, compared with cemented modern unipolar HA, with little evidence to suggest the size of this difference varied strongly between the arthroplasty treatments. 
Authors' conclusions
There was considerable variability in the ranking of each treatment such that there was no one outstanding, or subset of outstanding, superior treatments. However, cemented modern arthroplasties tended to more often yield better outcomes than alternative treatments and may be a more successful approach than internal fixation. There is no evidence of a difference between THA (single articulation) and cemented modern unipolar HA in the outcomes measured in this review. THA may be an appropriate treatment for a subset of people with intracapsular fracture but we have not explored this further.

Which Surgery is Best for a Broken Hip? A Study Comparing Different Treatments

### **Rationale**

A broken hip is a very serious injury. It is most common in older adults. A broken hip can make it hard to walk. It can also make it difficult to live on your own. This injury is a major problem for many people and their families.

Most people need an operation to fix a broken hip. But there are many different types of operations, also called surgeries. Doctors want to know which type of surgery is the best for their patients. It is not clear which treatment helps people live longer and have a better quality of life.

This study was done to compare all the different surgeries for a broken hip. The goal was to find out which treatments work best. Researchers wanted to see which treatments help people live longer, feel better, and avoid needing more surgery in the future.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, the researchers looked at studies that were already finished. They gathered all the results from 119 different studies. This allowed them to compare many treatments all at once. This is like doing a very large review of past research.

The studies included more than 17,000 older adults with a broken hip. Their ages were between 60 and 87 years old. About 3 out of every 4 people in the studies were women. All of them had a broken hip near the ball of the hip joint.

The researchers looked at what happened to the people in the studies over time. They checked on them for more than two years after their surgery. This helped them understand the long-term effects of each treatment.

### **Results**

The researchers compared 12 different ways to treat a broken hip. The treatments included different types of hip replacements. They also included using pins, screws, or plates to hold the broken bone together. To compare them, the researchers chose one common treatment to measure all the others against. This was a type of partial hip replacement where the new joint part is held in place with special bone cement.

**Staying Alive After Surgery**
The study looked at how many people died within one year of their surgery. With the main comparison treatment, about 24 out of 100 people died within a year. Some other treatments seemed to have a slightly higher risk of death. But the proof for this was not very strong.

**Quality of Life**
The study also looked at how people felt one year after their surgery. This is called quality of life. It includes things like pain and being able to do daily tasks. Some types of total hip replacement seemed to help people feel better. However, the proof for this was also not very strong.

**Needing Another Surgery**
The researchers checked how many people needed to have another surgery on their hip. With the main comparison treatment, about 4 out of 100 people needed another surgery. People who had their hip fixed with pins, plates, or screws were more likely to need another surgery. People who had a full or partial hip replacement were less likely to need another surgery.

**What the Researchers Concluded**
The researchers found that no single surgery was the best for everyone. Each treatment had different good points and bad points.

Overall, modern hip replacements that use bone cement seemed to give better results. These surgeries may be a better choice than using pins or screws to fix the bone. The study did not find a big difference between a total hip replacement and a partial hip replacement for the things they measured. This information can help doctors and patients talk about the best treatment choice for them.","Which are the best treatments for hip fractures in older adults?
Why is this question important? 
A hip fracture is a break at the top of the leg bone. We included people with a break just below the ball and socket joint. These types of broken hip are common in older adults whose bones may be fragile because of a condition called osteoporosis. They often happen after a fall from a standing or sitting position. The broken hip can be treated in different ways, and we don't know whether some treatments are better than others. 
What are the treatments? 
‐ Replacing the broken hip with an artificial one. This can be done using a hemiarthroplasty (HA), which replaces only the ball part of the joint, and can be unipolar (a single artificial joint) or bipolar which has an additional joint within the HA. A total hip arthroplasty (THA) replaces all of the hip joint, including the socket, and usually has just one artifical joint between the ball and the socket (single articulation) or sometimes two (dual‐mobility). All types of artificial joints can be fixed in place with or without bone cement. 
‐ Using metal implants to fix the broken parts of the bones. Pins or screws may be inserted through the two parts of broken bone, or the surgeon may use a 'fixed angle plate' which sits on the outer edge of the broken bone and is attached to the bone with screws or pins.  
‐ Treatment without an operation, usually requiring a period of rest in bed whilst the leg is held in position using traction with weights. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared one or more of these treatments. We wanted to find out the benefits and harms of these different treatments. We combined the findings from studies, and created a 'network' (which is used when researchers perform a 'network meta‐analysis' on the results from studies) to see if we could find out if some treatments were better than others. 
What did we find? 
We found 119 studies, involving 17,653 participants with 17,669 fractures. The average age of study participants ranged from 60 to 87 years; 73% were women, which is usual for people who have this type of hip fracture. We included 75 of these studies in our 'network'. 
We found that a modern design of unipolar HA fixed with bone cement, or some of the metal implants (fixed angle plates and pins), seem to have the greatest chance of reducing the number of deaths within 12 months of injury. Compared to people having these treatments, more people who were treated with an uncemented modern bipolar design of HA or with a THA (single articulation) died.  
We didn't find as many studies to include in our 'network' for health‐related quality of life, and none of the treatments made a meaningful improvement to people's quality of life.  
We also found that people treated with any of the hip replacements were less likely to need additional surgery on their broken hip than people treated with metal implants or treated without an operation. Amongst all the designs of hip replacements, fewer people needed additional surgery after treatment with a cemented modern unipolar design of HA ‐ but there was not a big difference in the findings for these hip replacement treatments. 
So, overall, cemented modern hip replacements tended to produce better outcomes and may be a more successful approach than attempting to fix the broken bone. THA (single articulation) may have increased the risk of death compared with cemented HA, without leading to an important difference in quality of life ‐ but we are not sure about this finding. This type of THA may be an appropriate treatment for some people with these fractures, but we have not studied this in this review. 
Are we confident in what we found? 
The true effects of these treatments might be very different to what we have found in this review. Many of the studies in this review were published before general reporting standards for research were improved, and so we could not be certain whether or not these studies were well‐conducted. Sometimes, the types of fractures were different (particularly between participants treated with metal implants and those treated with hip replacements), and this might have affected the results in the 'network'. We also found that the results included risks of potential benefits and harms, and this is often because there are not enough study participants to find a precise result. 
How up to date is this review? 
We ran our search in July 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD014545,"Background
The detection and diagnosis of caries at the earliest opportunity is fundamental to the preservation of tooth tissue and maintenance of oral health. Radiographs have traditionally been used to supplement the conventional visual‐tactile clinical examination. Accurate, timely detection and diagnosis of early signs of disease could afford patients the opportunity of less invasive treatment with less destruction of tooth tissue, reduce the need for treatment with aerosol‐generating procedures, and potentially result in a reduced cost of care to the patient and to healthcare services. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of different dental imaging methods to inform the detection and diagnosis of non‐cavitated enamel only coronal dental caries. 
Search methods
Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist undertook a search of the following databases: MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 31 December 2018); Embase Ovid (1980 to 31 December 2018); US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov, to 31 December 2018); and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 31 December 2018). We studied reference lists as well as published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
We included diagnostic accuracy study designs that compared a dental imaging method with a reference standard (histology, excavation, enhanced visual examination), studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of single index tests, and studies that directly compared two or more index tests. Studies reporting at both the patient or tooth surface level were included. In vitro and in vivo studies were eligible for inclusion. Studies that explicitly recruited participants with more advanced lesions that were obviously into dentine or frankly cavitated were excluded. We also excluded studies that artificially created carious lesions and those that used an index test during the excavation of dental caries to ascertain the optimum depth of excavation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors extracted data independently and in duplicate using a standardised data extraction form and quality assessment based on QUADAS‐2 specific to the clinical context. Estimates of diagnostic accuracy were determined using the bivariate hierarchical method to produce summary points of sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence regions. Comparative accuracy of different radiograph methods was conducted based on indirect and direct comparisons between methods. Potential sources of heterogeneity were pre‐specified and explored visually and more formally through meta‐regression. 
Main results
We included 104 datasets from 77 studies reporting a total of 15,518 tooth sites or surfaces. The most frequently reported imaging methods were analogue radiographs (55 datasets from 51 studies) and digital radiographs (42 datasets from 40 studies) followed by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) (7 datasets from 7 studies). Only 17 studies were of an in vivo study design, carried out in a clinical setting. No studies were considered to be at low risk of bias across all four domains but 16 studies were judged to have low concern for applicability across all domains. The patient selection domain had the largest number of studies judged to be at high risk of bias (43 studies); the index test, reference standard, and flow and timing domains were judged to be at high risk of bias in 30, 12, and 7 studies respectively. 
Studies were synthesised using a hierarchical bivariate method for meta‐analysis. There was substantial variability in the results of the individual studies, with sensitivities that ranged from 0 to 0.96 and specificities from 0 to 1.00. For all imaging methods the estimated summary sensitivity and specificity point was 0.47 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.53) and 0.88 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.92), respectively. In a cohort of 1000 tooth surfaces with a prevalence of enamel caries of 63%, this would result in 337 tooth surfaces being classified as disease free when enamel caries was truly present (false negatives), and 43 tooth surfaces being classified as diseased in the absence of enamel caries (false positives). Meta‐regression indicated that measures of accuracy differed according to the imaging method (Chi2(4) = 32.44, P < 0.001), with the highest sensitivity observed for CBCT, and the highest specificity observed for analogue radiographs. None of the specified potential sources of heterogeneity were able to explain the variability in results. No studies included restored teeth in their sample or reported the inclusion of sealants. 
We rated the certainty of the evidence as low for sensitivity and specificity and downgraded two levels in total for risk of bias due to limitations in the design and conduct of the included studies, indirectness arising from the in vitro studies, and the observed inconsistency of the results. 
Authors' conclusions
The design and conduct of studies to determine the diagnostic accuracy of methods to detect and diagnose caries in situ are particularly challenging. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that imaging for the detection or diagnosis of early caries may have poor sensitivity but acceptable specificity, resulting in a relatively high number of false‐negative results with the potential for early disease to progress. If left untreated, the opportunity to provide professional or self‐care practices to arrest or reverse early caries lesions will be missed. The specificity of lesion detection is however relatively high, and one could argue that initiation of non‐invasive management (such as the use of topical fluoride), is probably of low risk. 
CBCT showed superior sensitivity to analogue or digital radiographs but has very limited applicability to the general dental practitioner. However, given the high‐radiation dose, and potential for caries‐like artefacts from existing restorations, its use cannot be justified in routine caries detection. Nonetheless, if early incidental carious lesions are detected in CBCT scans taken for other purposes, these should be reported. CBCT has the potential to be used as a reference standard in diagnostic studies of this type. 
Despite the robust methodology applied in this comprehensive review, the results should be interpreted with some caution due to shortcomings in the design and execution of many of the included studies. Future research should evaluate the comparative accuracy of different methods, be undertaken in a clinical setting, and focus on minimising bias arising from the use of imperfect reference standards in clinical studies.

Do Dental Scans and X-Rays Find Early Cavities? A Review of the Research

### **Rationale**

Tooth decay, also known as a cavity, is a very common health problem. A cavity starts as a tiny weak spot on the hard outer layer of your tooth. This layer is called enamel.

If a dentist finds a weak spot early, the treatment can be very simple. Sometimes, you may only need a fluoride treatment and not a filling. Finding decay early helps save your natural tooth. It also helps you avoid more complex dental work, like drilling.

Dentists use a visual check-up and X-rays to find tooth decay. But it is not clear how well X-rays and other scans can find these very early weak spots. Researchers did this study to learn more. They wanted to find out how accurate different dental scans are at spotting the first signs of a cavity.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers looked for all the past studies on this topic. This type of study is called a review. It helps combine the results from many studies to get a stronger answer.

The researchers found 77 studies to include in their review. Together, these studies looked at more than 15,000 teeth or tooth surfaces. Most of these studies were done in a lab on teeth that had been removed. A smaller number of studies were done with real patients in dental clinics.

The studies tested a few different types of scans. These included:
*   Old-style film X-rays
*   Newer digital X-rays
*   A special 3D scan called a cone beam CT, or CBCT scan

The researchers checked how accurate the scans were by comparing them to a perfect result. The perfect result was found by looking at the tooth itself after it was removed or by carefully checking the tooth surface during a procedure.

### **Results**

The review showed that, overall, the scans were not very good at finding early tooth decay. However, the scans were very good at correctly identifying teeth that were healthy.

The scans missed about half of all the weak spots on teeth. For example, if 10 teeth had early decay, these scans might only find about 5 of them. This is a problem because a missed spot can turn into a bigger cavity over time. If a dentist misses the early decay, the chance to stop it with simple care is lost.

On the other hand, the scans were very good at knowing when a tooth was healthy. They almost never said a healthy tooth had decay when it did not. This is good because it means patients are not likely to get treatment on a tooth that does not need it.

When comparing the different types of scans, the 3D CBCT scan was the best at finding early decay. But this scan uses a lot more radiation than a normal X-ray. For this reason, doctors do not recommend it for routine check-ups to look for cavities.

The researchers who did the review said we should be careful. The evidence suggests that a dental scan may not be enough to find very early decay. They also noted that many of the studies they looked at were not perfect. More and better research is needed to find the best ways to spot tooth decay as early as possible.","Dental imaging methods for the detection of early tooth decay
Why is it important to improve the detection of dental caries (tooth decay)? Dentists often aim to identify tooth decay that has already advanced to a level which needs a filling. If dentists were able to find tooth decay when it has only affected the outer layer of the tooth (enamel) then it is possible to stop the decay from spreading any further and prevent the need for fillings. It is also important to avoid a false‐positive result, when treatment may be given when caries is absent. 
What is the aim of this review?This Cochrane Review aimed to find out how accurate X‐ray images and other types of dental imaging are for detecting early tooth decay as part of the dental 'check‐up' for children and adults who visit their general dentist. Researchers in Cochrane included 77 studies published between 1986 and 2018 to answer this question. 
What was studied in the review?Three main types of dental imaging were studied in this review: analogue or digital radiographs (X‐rays) and three‐dimensional (3D) imaging (cone beam computed tomography (CBCT)). We studied decay on the occlusal surfaces (biting surfaces of the back teeth), the proximal surfaces (tooth surfaces that are next to each other), and smooth surfaces. 
What are the main results of the review?Researchers in Cochrane included 77 studies with a total of 15,518 tooth sites or surfaces, where typically 63% of tooth sites or surfaces had enamel caries. Some of these studies reported on more than one type of imaging, on both the permanent and primary ('milk') teeth or different tooth surfaces, and this gave us 104 sets of data to use. If these methods were to be used by a dentist for a routine dental examination, out of 1000 tooth sites or surfaces seen:• the use of these methods will indicate that 336 tooth sites or surfaces will have early tooth decay, and of these, 43 (13%) will have no disease (incorrect diagnosis ‐ false positive);• of the 664 tooth sites with a result indicating that early tooth decay is absent, 337 (51%) will have early tooth decay (incorrect diagnosis ‐ false negative).This high proportion of false‐negative results means that early signs of decay will be missed. We found evidence that 3D imaging methods were better than analogue or digital radiographs at identifying early disease but that analogue radiographs were better at identifying disease‐free tooth surfaces. 
Please see oralhealth.cochrane.org/imaging-modalities-inform-detection-and-diagnosis-early-caries. 
How reliable are the results of the studies in this review?We only included studies that assessed healthy teeth or those that were thought to have early tooth decay. This is because teeth with deep tooth decay would be easier to identify. However, there were some problems with how the studies were conducted. This may result in these methods appearing more accurate than they are, increasing the number of correct results. We judged the certainty of the evidence to be low due to how the studies selected their participants and the large number of studies that were carried out in a laboratory setting on extracted teeth, and the variation in the results. 
Who do the results of this review apply to?Studies included in the review were carried out in South America, Europe, Asia, and the US. A large number of studies examined extracted teeth, while clinical studies were completed in dental hospitals or general dental practices. 
What are the implications of this review?Low‐certainty evidence suggests that imaging for the detection or diagnosis of early tooth decay may result in a relatively high proportion of false‐negative results, with the potential for early disease to become more advanced. If left untreated, the opportunity to provide professional or self‐care practices to arrest or reverse early tooth decay will be missed. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?The electronic searches retrieved used studies published up to 31 December 2018.

Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is characterized by tachypnea and signs of respiratory distress. Transient tachypnea typically appears within the first two hours of life in term and late preterm newborns. Supportive management might be sufficient. Non‐invasive (i.e. without endotracheal intubation) respiratory support may, however, be administered to reduce respiratory distress during TTN. In addition, non‐invasive respiratory support might improve clearance of lung liquid thus reducing the effort required to breathe, improving respiratory distress and potentially reducing the duration of tachypnea. 
Objectives
To assess benefits and harms of non‐invasive respiratory support for the management of transient tachypnea of the newborn. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1996 to 19 February 2019), Embase (1980 to 19 February 2019) and CINAHL (1982 to 19 February 2019). We applied no language restrictions. We searched clinical trial registries for ongoing studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials, quasi‐randomized controlled trials and cluster trials on non‐invasive respiratory support provided to infants born at 34 weeks' gestational age or more and less than three days of age with transient tachypnea of the newborn. 
Data collection and analysis
For each of the included trials, two review authors independently extracted data (e.g. number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, duration of oxygen therapy, need for continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] and need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation, etc.) and assessed the risk of bias (e.g. adequacy of randomization, blinding, completeness of follow‐up). The primary outcomes considered in this review were need for mechanical ventilation and pneumothorax. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We included three trials (150 infants) comparing either CPAP to free‐flow oxygen, nasal intermittent mandatory ventilation to nasal CPAP, or nasal high‐frequency percussive ventilation versus nasal CPAP. Due to these different comparisons and to high clinical heterogeneity in the baseline clinical characteristics, we did not pool the three studies. The use of CPAP versus free oxygen did not improve the primary outcomes of this review: need for mechanical ventilation (risk ratio [RR] 0.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01 to 6.99; 1 study, 64 participants); and pneumothorax (not estimable, no cases occurred). Among secondary outcomes, CPAP reduced the duration of tachypnea as compared to free oxygen (mean difference [MD] −21.10 hours, 95% CI −22.92 to −19.28; 1 study, 64 participants). Nasal intermittent ventilation did not reduce the need for mechanical ventilation as compared with CPAP (RR 4.00, 95% CI 0.49 to 32.72; 1 study, 40 participants) or the incidence of pneumothorax (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 14.90; 1 study, 40 participants); duration of tachypnea did not differ (MD 4.30, 95% CI −19.14 to 27.74; 1 study, 40 participants). In the study comparing nasal high‐frequency ventilation to CPAP, no cases of mechanical ventilation of pneumothorax occurred (not estimable; 1 study, 46 participants); duration of tachypnea was reduced in the nasal high‐frequency ventilation group (MD −4.53, 95% CI −5.64 to −3.42; 1 study, 46 participants). The quality of the evidence was very low due to the imprecision of the estimates and unclear risk of bias for detection bias and high risk of bias for reporting bias. Tests for heterogeneity were not applicable for any of the analyses as no studies were pooled. Two trials are ongoing. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to establish the benefit and harms of non‐invasive respiratory support in the management of transient tachypnea of the newborn. Though two of the included trials showed a shorter duration of tachypnea, clinically relevant outcomes did not differ amongst the groups. Given the limited and low quality of the evidence available, it was impossible to determine whether non‐invasive respiratory support was safe or effective for the treatment of transient tachypnea of the newborn.

Does Breathing Support Help Newborns with Fast Breathing?

**Rationale**
Some newborn babies have a breathing problem right after birth. This is called transient tachypnea of the newborn, or TTN. ""Transient"" means that the problem is temporary and goes away. ""Tachypnea"" means fast breathing. Babies with TTN breathe much faster than normal and may seem to be working hard to breathe.

This problem happens when there is extra fluid in the baby’s lungs. Before birth, a baby’s lungs are filled with fluid. This fluid usually gets cleared out during and after birth. But sometimes, the fluid clears out too slowly. This extra fluid makes it hard for the baby to get enough oxygen.

Doctors can give babies breathing support to help them. This support is ""non-invasive,"" which means a breathing tube is not put down the baby’s throat. Instead, the baby gets help from a small mask over their nose or soft prongs in their nostrils. This support gently pushes air into the lungs. This may help keep the tiny air sacs in the lungs open.

Researchers thought this breathing support might help babies with TTN. It could help clear the fluid from the lungs faster. This would make breathing easier for the baby. They did this review to see if this kind of breathing support is helpful and safe for babies with this condition. They wanted to know if it was better than just giving the baby extra oxygen to breathe.

**Trial Design**
To find an answer, the researchers did not do a new study with patients. Instead, they looked at studies that were already done. They searched for all the studies they could find on this topic. This type of research is called a review. It helps to combine the results from many studies to get a stronger answer.

The researchers looked for specific types of studies called clinical trials. In these trials, babies with TTN were chosen by chance to get one treatment or another.

The review included studies with newborn babies. The babies were born close to their due date (at 34 weeks of pregnancy or later). All the babies had been diagnosed with TTN in the first three days of life. The researchers looked at the information from these past studies to compare the results.

**Results**
The researchers found three studies to include in their review. In total, these studies included 150 babies. The studies were small. They also compared different types of breathing support, so their results could not be combined.

One study compared using a breathing mask called CPAP to just giving a baby extra oxygen. Another study compared two different types of breathing support given through the nose. The third study also compared two different types of breathing support given through the nose.

The researchers wanted to see if the breathing support helped prevent two main problems. First, they looked at the need for a breathing machine. A breathing machine is a bigger machine that breathes for the baby when they cannot breathe on their own. Second, they looked for a serious lung problem called a collapsed lung. The review found that the breathing support did not seem to reduce the chances of a baby needing a breathing machine. There were no cases of a collapsed lung in any of the groups.

However, the breathing support did show some other possible benefits. In two of the three studies, babies who got breathing support stopped breathing fast sooner than babies who did not. Their breathing returned to normal more quickly.

The researchers said that the quality of the studies was very low. This means we cannot be very sure about the results. Because the studies were small and of low quality, it is hard to make a strong conclusion.

The authors of the review concluded that there is not enough proof yet. We do not know for sure if non-invasive breathing support is helpful or safe for babies with TTN. More and better studies are needed to find the best way to care for these babies. Two new studies on this topic are happening now.","The use of respiratory support without endotracheal tube (i.e. non‐invasive) in babies to manage rapid breathing (transient tachypnea of the newborn) 
Review question 
Does the use of respiratory support without endotracheal tube (i.e. non‐invasive) in babies with rapid breathing (transient tachypnea of the newborn) improve lung function and reduce the need for invasive respiratory support with an endotracheal tube? 
Background 
Transient tachypnea (abnormally rapid breathing) of the newborn is characterized by high respiratory rate (more than 60 breaths per minute) and signs of respiratory distress (difficulty in breathing). It typically appears within the first two hours of life in infants born at or after 34 weeks' gestational age. Although transient tachypnea of the newborn usually improves without treatment, it might be associated with wheezing in late childhood. The idea behind using non‐invasive respiratory support for transient tachypnea of the newborn consists of reducing fluid from small cavities within the lungs called the alveoli and providing support to the baby with breathing difficulties. This review reports and critically analyzes the available evidence on the benefit and harms of non‐invasive respiratory support in the management of transient tachypnea of the newborn. 
Study characteristics 
We identified and included three studies (150 newborns in total) comparing the use of non‐invasive respiratory support with oxygen (one study), or different types of non‐invasive respiratory support (two studies). We found two ongoing studies. Evidence is up to date as of February 2019. 
Results 
The very limited available evidence cannot answer our review question. Non‐invasive respiratory support did not improve lung function or reduce the need for respiratory support.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication amongst people who are critically ill, and it is associated with an increased risk of death. For people with severe AKI, continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT), which is delivered over 24 hours, is needed when they become haemodynamically unstable. When CKRT is interrupted due to clotting of the extracorporeal circuit, the delivered dose is decreased and thus leading to undertreatment. 
Objectives
This review assessed the efficacy of non‐pharmacological measures to maintain circuit patency in CKRT. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 25 January 2021 which includes records identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (parallel‐group and cross‐over studies), cluster RCTs and quasi‐RCTs that examined non‐pharmacological interventions to prevent clotting of extracorporeal circuits during CKRT.  
Data collection and analysis
Three pairs of review authors independently extracted information including participants, interventions/comparators, outcomes, study methods, and risk of bias. The primary outcomes were circuit lifespan and death due to any cause at day 28. We used a random‐effects model to perform quantitative synthesis (meta‐analysis). We assessed the risk of bias in included studies using the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing the risk of bias. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. 
Main results
A total of 20 studies involving 1143 randomised participants were included in the review. The methodological quality of the included studies was low, mainly due to the unclear randomisation process and blinding of the intervention. We found evidence on the following 11 comparisons: (i) continuous venovenous haemodialysis (CVVHD) versus continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH) or continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF); (ii) CVVHDF versus CVVH; (iii) higher blood flow (≥ 250 mL/minute) versus standard blood flow (< 250 mL/minute); (iv) AN69 membrane (AN69ST) versus other membranes; (v) pre‐dilution versus post‐dilution; (vi) a longer catheter (> 20 cm) placing the tip targeting the right atrium versus a shorter catheter (≤ 20 cm) placing the tip in the superior vena cava; (vii) surface‐modified double‐lumen catheter versus standard double‐lumen catheter with identical geometry and flow design; (viii) single‐site infusion anticoagulation versus double‐site infusion anticoagulation; (ix) flat plate filter versus hollow fibre filter of the same membrane type; (x) a filter with a larger membrane surface area versus a smaller one; and (xi) a filter with more and shorter hollow fibre versus a standard filter of the same membrane type. 
Circuit lifespan was reported in 9 comparisons. Low certainty evidence indicated that CVVHDF (versus CVVH: MD 10.15 hours, 95% CI 5.15 to 15.15; 1 study, 62 circuits), pre‐dilution haemofiltration (versus post‐dilution haemofiltration: MD 9.34 hours, 95% CI ‐2.60 to 21.29; 2 studies, 47 circuits; I² = 13%), placing the tip of a longer catheter targeting the right atrium (versus placing a shorter catheter targeting the tip in the superior vena cava: MD 6.50 hours, 95% CI 1.48 to 11.52; 1 study, 420 circuits), and surface‐modified double‐lumen catheter (versus standard double‐lumen catheter: MD 16.00 hours, 95% CI 13.49 to 18.51; 1 study, 262 circuits) may prolong circuit lifespan. However, higher blood flow may not increase circuit lifespan (versus standard blood flow: MD 0.64, 95% CI ‐3.37 to 4.64; 2 studies, 499 circuits; I² = 70%). More and shorter hollow fibre filters (versus standard filters: MD ‐5.87 hours, 95% CI ‐10.18 to ‐1.56; 1 study, 6 circuits) may reduce circuit lifespan. 
Death from any cause was reported in four comparisons We are uncertain whether CVVHDF versus CVVH, CVVHD versus CVVH or CVVHDF, longer versus a shorter catheter, or surface‐modified double‐lumen catheters versus standard double‐lumen catheters reduced death due to any cause, in very low certainty evidence. 
Recovery of kidney function was reported in three comparisons. We are uncertain whether CVVHD versus CVVH or CVVHDF, CVVHDF versus CVVH, or surface‐modified double‐lumen catheters versus standard double‐lumen catheters increased recovery of kidney function. 
Vascular access complications were reported in two comparisons. Low certainty evidence indicated using a longer catheter (versus a shorter catheter: RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.74) may reduce vascular access complications, however, the use of surface‐modified double lumen catheters versus standard double‐lumen catheters may make little or no difference to vascular access complications. 
Authors' conclusions
The use of CVVHDF as compared with CVVH, pre‐dilution haemofiltration, a longer catheter, and surface‐modified double‐lumen catheter may prolong the circuit lifespan, while higher blood flow and more and shorter hollow fibre filter may reduce circuit life. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed to be low to very low due to the small sample size of the included studies. 
Data from future rigorous and transparent research are much needed in order to fully understand the effects of non‐pharmacological interventions in preventing circuit coagulation amongst people with AKI receiving CKRT.

How to Keep Kidney Cleaning Machines Running Longer Without Using Drugs

### **Rationale**

When people are very sick in the hospital, their kidneys can suddenly stop working. This is a serious problem called acute kidney injury. It can be life-threatening.

To help these patients, doctors use a special machine that cleans their blood. This treatment is called continuous kidney replacement therapy, or CKRT. The machine works like an artificial kidney. It runs 24 hours a day to remove waste from the blood.

A common problem is that blood clots can form in the machine’s tubes. When this happens, the machine stops working. The treatment must be paused to fix the problem. This means very sick patients do not get the full amount of blood cleaning they need.

Researchers in this study wanted to find ways to stop these blood clots without using extra medicines. They looked at past studies to see if changing the machine’s setup or parts could help it run longer without stopping.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers reviewed studies that were already done. They searched for all the best studies on this topic. This kind of research is called a review.

The researchers found 20 studies to include in their review. These studies involved a total of 1143 very sick adults. All of these patients had kidneys that had stopped working and were being treated with a CKRT machine.

The researchers looked at what these past studies found. The studies had compared different ways to run the CKRT machine. For example, they compared different machine settings, different types of blood filters, and different kinds of tubes used to connect the patient to the machine.

### **Results**

The main goal was to see what helped the kidney machine run for a longer time before a blood clot stopped it.

The researchers found a few things that may help the machine run longer:

*   Using a certain type of CKRT treatment called CVVHDF.
*   Adding fluid to the blood before it goes into the machine’s filter.
*   Using a longer tube to connect the patient to the machine. The tube reached a large blood vessel near the heart.
*   Using a tube that had a special smooth coating.

The review also found some things that did not help or made things worse. Making the blood flow faster through the machine did not seem to help it run longer. Using a filter with more, but shorter, tiny tubes seemed to make the machine clot faster.

The researchers also looked to see if these methods helped patients live longer or helped their kidneys get better. They could not be sure if any of the methods made a difference for these outcomes. They also found that using a longer tube might cause fewer problems where the tube enters the body.

The researchers concluded that some of these non-drug methods may help keep the machine running. However, they were not very sure about these results. The studies they looked at were small and had some weaknesses. Because of this, the evidence is thought to be low quality. More and better research is needed to be certain about the best ways to prevent blood clots in these life-saving machines.","Non‐pharmacological interventions for preventing clotting of extracorporeal circuits during continuous kidney replacement therapy 
What is the issue? 
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major problem in people with severe illness. In cases of severe AKI, kidney replacement therapy/dialysis (KRT) using circuits is necessary. Continuous kidney replacement therapy is performed continuously over 24 hours. Clotting of the CKRT circuit can interfere with this treatment. To prevent this, a variety of non‐pharmacological (not using medication) interventions have been studied. We aimed to summarise current evidence regarding the efficacy of non‐pharmacological interventions for preventing clotting of extracorporeal circuits during CKRT. 
What did we do? 
We searched for available evidence from the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 25 January 2021. Our review summarised the results of 20 randomised studies involving a total of 1143 people. 
What did we find? 
We found that the quality of the 20 included studies was low, and the number randomised was small. The majority of the included studies did not report death as an outcome. We found that continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF), as compared with continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH), may prolong circuit lifespan. In addition, pre‐dilution haemofiltration, as compared with post‐dilution haemofiltration, a longer catheter placing the tip at the right atrium, as compared with a shorter catheter placing the tip in the superior vena cava, and surface‐modified double lumen catheter, as compared with standard double lumen catheter, may extend the circuit lifespan. However, higher blood flow compared to standard blood flow rate might not affect circuit lifespan. Overall, the data was limited and of very low certainty. 
Conclusions 
We found that the effects of non‐pharmacological interventions in people with AKI receiving CKRT remain unclear. There is a need for studies assessing CKRT circuit lifespan as well as other clinically important outcomes.

10.1002-14651858.CD013836.pub2,"Background
Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It is the third leading cause of neonatal mortality globally constituting 13% of overall neonatal mortality. Despite the high burden of neonatal sepsis, high‐quality evidence in diagnosis and treatment is scarce. Due to the diagnostic challenges of sepsis and the relative immunosuppression of the newborn, many neonates receive antibiotics for suspected sepsis. Antibiotics have become the most used therapeutics in neonatal intensive care units, and observational studies in high‐income countries suggest that 83% to 94% of newborns treated with antibiotics for suspected sepsis have negative blood cultures. The last Cochrane Review was updated in 2005. There is a need for an updated systematic review assessing the effects of different antibiotic regimens for late‐onset neonatal sepsis. 
Objectives
To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of different antibiotic regimens for late‐onset neonatal sepsis. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: CENTRAL (2021, Issue 3); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase Ovid; CINAHL; LILACS; Science Citation Index EXPANDED and Conference Proceedings Citation Index – Science on 12 March 2021. We also searched clinical trials databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing different antibiotic regimens for late‐onset neonatal sepsis. We included participants older than 72 hours of life at randomisation, suspected or diagnosed with neonatal sepsis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, or necrotising enterocolitis. We excluded trials that assessed treatment of fungal infections. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Our primary outcome was all‐cause mortality, and our secondary outcomes were: serious adverse events, respiratory support, circulatory support, nephrotoxicity, neurological developmental impairment, necrotising enterocolitis, and ototoxicity. Our primary time point of interest was at maximum follow‐up. 
Main results
We included five RCTs (580 participants). All trials were at high risk of bias, and had very low‐certainty evidence. 
The five included trials assessed five different comparisons of antibiotics.
We did not conduct a meta‐analysis due to lack of relevant data.
Of the five included trials one trial compared cefazolin plus amikacin with vancomycin plus amikacin; one trial compared ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid with flucloxacillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared cloxacillin plus amikacin with cefotaxime plus gentamicin; one trial compared meropenem with standard care (ampicillin plus gentamicin or cefotaxime plus gentamicin); and one trial compared vancomycin plus gentamicin with vancomycin plus aztreonam. 
None of the five comparisons found any evidence of a difference when assessing all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events, circulatory support, nephrotoxicity, neurological developmental impairment, or necrotising enterocolitis; however, none of the trials were near an information size that could contribute significantly to the evidence of the comparative benefits and risks of any particular antibiotic regimen. 
None of the trials assessed respiratory support or ototoxicity.
The benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens remain unclear due to the lack of well‐powered trials and the high risk of systematic errors. 
Authors' conclusions
Current evidence is insufficient to support any antibiotic regimen being superior to another. RCTs assessing different antibiotic regimens in late‐onset neonatal sepsis with low risks of bias are warranted.

Which Medicines Work Best for Serious Infections in Newborns?

**Rationale**
A serious blood infection in a newborn baby is called neonatal sepsis. This is a very dangerous condition. It can make babies very sick and is one of the main reasons that newborn babies die.

Doctors often have a hard time knowing for sure if a baby has this infection. The signs can be hard to see. Because the infection is so risky, doctors often give strong medicines called antibiotics to a baby who might have it. This is to be safe. But, most babies who get these medicines turn out not to have the infection. Giving strong medicines when they are not needed can have its own risks.

There are many different types of antibiotics. Right now, doctors do not have clear proof about which ones work best to treat these infections in babies. The last big study that looked at all the research was done a long time ago. We need up-to-date information. This study was done to look at all the past research. The researchers wanted to see if some antibiotic medicines are better or safer than others for newborn babies with serious infections.

**Trial Design**
This was not a study where researchers gave new medicine to babies. Instead, they looked for all the good studies that had already been done on this topic. This type of research is called a systematic review. It helps bring all the information from past studies together in one place. This can give us a bigger and clearer picture.

The researchers searched for a special type of study called a randomized controlled trial. In these studies, babies are put into groups just by chance. Each group gets a different antibiotic treatment. This is the best way to compare treatments to see which one works better.

The researchers looked for studies that included newborn babies who were more than 3 days old. The babies in these studies were all thought to have a serious infection. The researchers planned to collect all the information from these studies. They wanted to compare the good effects and bad effects of the different antibiotics.

**Results**
The researchers found five studies that met their rules. In total, these five studies included 580 babies. After looking closely at the studies, the researchers found that all of them had a high chance of being wrong. This can happen if a study is not designed well. This means we cannot be very sure about the results. The information from these studies was not very strong.

Each of the five studies compared different antibiotic medicines. For example, one study might compare medicine A to medicine B. Another study might compare medicine C to medicine D. Because the studies were all so different and small, the researchers could not combine their results to get one main answer.

The researchers looked to see if any antibiotic was better at saving a baby’s life. They found no proof that one antibiotic was better than another. They also looked for serious side effects. This included things like needing a machine to help with breathing, problems with blood flow, or kidney damage. They found no differences between the antibiotic groups for any of these problems.

The main conclusion is that we still do not know which antibiotic is best for treating serious infections in newborn babies. The studies we have now are too small. They also have too many problems in how they were done. We cannot use them to make good choices. The researchers said that we urgently need new studies. These studies must be large and very well-planned. This will give us the strong proof we need to find the best and safest treatment for these very sick babies.","Antibiotic regimens for late‐onset neonatal sepsis
Review question 
We reviewed the available evidence on different antibiotic regimens for newborns (from 72 hours of life to one month of life) with late‐onset sepsis. 
Background 
Sepsis in newborns is a severe and potential lethal condition, caused by the body's response to an infection. Neonatal sepsis is the third leading cause of neonatal death globally. Despite this high burden of sepsis in newborns, high‐quality evidence in diagnosis and treatment is scarce. This Cochrane Review was originally published in 2005. To identify the most appropriate antibiotic policies for neonatal sepsis, there is a need to base these policies on an updated well‐conducted review. Therefore, there is a need for such a review assessing the effects of different antibiotic regimens for late‐onset neonatal sepsis. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to March 2021. We included five trials randomising 580 participants. The five trials compared five different antibiotic regimens. 
Key results 
We included five trials: one trial compared cefazolin plus amikacin with vancomycin plus amikacin; one trial compared ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid with flucloxacillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared cloxacillin plus amikacin with cefotaxime plus gentamicin; one trial compared meropenem with standard care (ampicillin plus gentamicin or cefotaxime plus gentamicin); and one trial compared vancomycin plus gentamicin with vancomycin plus aztreonam. 
None of the five antibiotic comparisons showed that the choice of antibiotics influenced the effects on death from all‐causes, serious adverse events (i.e. major complications), circulatory support, nephrotoxicity (toxicity in the kidneys), neurological developmental impairment (disabilities in the functioning of the brain that affect a child's behaviour, memory, or ability to learn), or necrotising enterocolitis (tissues in the gut become inflamed and start to die). Current evidence cannot confirm or reject, one antibiotic regimen being superior to another due to scarce data. 
Quality of the evidence 
Our conclusions are based on very low‐quality evidence. The five trials were at high risk of bias (i.e. the trials were conducted in a way that may have skewed results to the positive side). In addition, the five trials included few participants, making the results of this review imprecise. 
"
10.1002-14651858.CD015043,"Background
The role of vitamin D supplementation as a treatment for COVID‐19 has been a subject of considerable discussion. A thorough understanding of the current evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of vitamin D supplementation for COVID‐19 based on randomised controlled trials is required. 
Objectives
To assess whether vitamin D supplementation is effective and safe for the treatment of COVID‐19 in comparison to an active comparator, placebo, or standard of care alone, and to maintain the currency of the evidence, using a living systematic review approach. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, Web of Science and the WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions to 11 March 2021. 
Selection criteria
We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID‐19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. 
We excluded studies investigating preventive effects, or studies including populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)). 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodology.
To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane risk of bias tool (ROB 2) for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following prioritised outcome categories: individuals with moderate or severe COVID‐19: all‐cause mortality, clinical status, quality of life, adverse events, serious adverse events, and for individuals with asymptomatic or mild disease: all‐cause mortality, development of severe clinical COVID‐19 symptoms, quality of life, adverse events, serious adverse events. 
Main results
We identified three RCTs with 356 participants, of whom 183 received vitamin D. In accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) clinical progression scale, two studies investigated participants with moderate or severe disease, and one study individuals with mild or asymptomatic disease. The control groups consisted of placebo treatment or standard of care alone. 
Effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID‐19 and moderate to severe disease 
We included two studies with 313 participants. Due to substantial clinical and methodological diversity of both studies, we were not able to pool data. Vitamin D status was unknown in one study, whereas the other study reported data for vitamin D deficient participants. One study administered multiple doses of oral calcifediol at days 1, 3 and 7,  whereas the other study gave a single high dose of oral cholecalciferol at baseline. We assessed one study with low risk of bias for effectiveness outcomes, and the other with some concerns about randomisation and selective reporting. 
All‐cause mortality at hospital discharge (313 participants) 
We found two studies reporting data for this outcome. One study reported no deaths when treated with vitamin D out of 50 participants, compared to two deaths out of 26 participants in the control group (Risk ratio (RR) 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 2.13). The other study reported nine deaths out of 119 individuals in the vitamin D group, whereas six participants out of 118 died in the placebo group (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.55 to 4.04]. We are very uncertain whether vitamin D has an effect on all‐cause mortality at hospital discharge (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Clinical status assessed by the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (237 participants) 
We found one study reporting data for this outcome. Nine out of 119 participants needed invasive mechanical ventilation when treated with vitamin D, compared to 17 out of 118 participants in the placebo group (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.13). Vitamin D supplementation may decrease need for invasive mechanical ventilation, but the evidence is uncertain (low‐certainty evidence). 
Quality of life 
We did not find data for quality of life.
Safety of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID‐19 and moderate to severe disease 
We did not include data from one study, because assessment of serious adverse events was not described and we are concerned that data might have been inconsistently measured. This study reported vomiting in one out of 119 participants immediately after vitamin D intake (RR 2.98, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.30). We are very uncertain whether vitamin D supplementation is associated with higher risk for adverse events (very low‐certainty). 
Effectiveness and safety of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID‐19 and asymptomatic or mild disease 
We found one study including 40 individuals, which did not report our prioritised outcomes, but instead data for viral clearance, inflammatory markers, and vitamin D serum levels. The authors reported no events of hypercalcaemia, but recording and assessment of further adverse events remains unclear. Authors administered oral cholecalciferol in daily doses for at least 14 days, and continued with weekly doses if vitamin D blood levels were > 50 ng/mL. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation as a treatment of COVID‐19. The evidence for the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for the treatment of COVID‐19 is very uncertain. Moreover, we found only limited safety information, and were concerned about consistency in measurement and recording of these outcomes. 
There was substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity of included studies, mainly because of different supplementation strategies, formulations, vitamin D status of participants, and reported outcomes. 
There is an urgent need for well‐designed and adequately powered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with an appropriate randomisation procedure, comparability of study arms and preferably double‐blinding. We identified 21 ongoing and three completed studies without published results, which indicates that these needs will be addressed and that our findings are subject to change in the future. Due to the living approach of this work, we will update the review periodically.

Does Taking Vitamin D Help Treat People with COVID-19? A Review of the Research

### **Rationale**

COVID-19 is a sickness caused by a virus. It has made many people around the world very sick. Doctors and scientists have been working hard to find treatments that can help people get better.

Some people believe that vitamin D could be a helpful treatment. Vitamin D is a nutrient that our bodies need to stay healthy. It helps our immune system, which is our body's defense against germs, work well.

Researchers wanted to know if giving vitamin D to people who already have COVID-19 could help them. They looked at all the best research available to see if vitamin D is a safe and helpful treatment. This study brings all that information together to find a clear answer.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with its own patients. Instead, the researchers did a review. They searched for and looked at studies that were already completed by other scientists.

They only included a special type of study called a randomized controlled trial. These are the best type of studies to see if a treatment works. In these studies, people are put into groups by chance.

This review looked at 3 studies. In total, these studies included 356 adults who had COVID-19. Some people in the studies had mild sickness. Others were sicker and were in the hospital.

In each study, one group of people was given vitamin D. The other group was given a dummy pill, which has no medicine in it (this is called a placebo), or they received the normal hospital care. Comparing these groups helps show if vitamin D made a real difference.

### **Results**

The main result of this review is that there is not enough good proof right now to know if vitamin D helps or hurts people with COVID-19. The information from the studies was unclear.

**For people with serious COVID-19 in the hospital:**

The review found two studies for this group. The two studies were very different, which made it hard to compare them.

*   **Did it help people live longer?** The results were mixed. One study showed that fewer people died when they took vitamin D. But the other study did not show this. Because of these different results, the researchers are very unsure if vitamin D helps prevent death from COVID-19.

*   **Did it help with breathing?** One study looked at whether people needed a machine to help them breathe. Fewer people in the vitamin D group needed a breathing machine (about 9 out of 119 people) compared to the group that did not get vitamin D (about 17 out of 118 people). This sounds hopeful, but the researchers said they are not sure about this result.

**For people with mild COVID-19:**

The review found one small study for this group. This study did not report on the most important things, like if people got sicker or died. So, it did not help answer the main question.

**Were there any side effects?**

There was very little information about the safety of taking vitamin D for COVID-19. One person reported vomiting after taking vitamin D. It was not clear if this was caused by the vitamin D.

**What the researchers concluded:**

The researchers concluded that we cannot say for sure if vitamin D is a good treatment for COVID-19. The studies they found were small and gave unclear or mixed results.

We need more and better studies to get a clear answer. The good news is that there are many new studies on vitamin D and COVID-19 happening now. The researchers will update this review when results from those new studies are ready. This may give us a better answer in the future.","Is vitamin D an effective and safe treatment for COVID‐19?
Key messages 
‐ We did not find enough, good‐quality evidence to judge whether vitamin D is an effective or safe treatment for adults with COVID‐19. 
‐ We need more research on this topic. Future research should focus on well‐designed studies with robust methods. 
‐ We identified 21 studies on this topic that are ongoing. We will update this review when more evidence becomes available. 
What is the link between vitamin D and COVID‐19? 
Some studies have shown that people who are in hospital with severe COVID‐19 also have low levels of  vitamin D (vitamin D deficiency). However, the risk factors for developing severe COVID‐19 are the same as those for developing vitamin D deficiency, so it is difficult to tell if vitamin D deficiency itself is a risk factor for severe COVID‐19. Risk factors include general ill‐health, a poor diet, and pre‐existing health conditions, such as diabetes, and liver and kidney disease. 
Vitamin D is important for healthy bones, teeth and muscles. It helps to regulate blood sugar, the heart and blood vessels, and the lungs and airways. It also has a role in boosting the body’s immune system. These are areas affected by COVID‐19, so giving vitamin D to people with COVID‐19 might help them to recover more quickly or have the disease less severely. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out the effects of giving vitamin D to adults with confirmed COVID‐19 on the following: 
‐ death from any cause;
‐ improvement or worsening of the patient’s condition;
‐ unwanted effects; and
‐ quality of life.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed the use of vitamin D as a treatment for adults with confirmed COVID‐19 compared with a placebo (sham treatment) or another treatment. Vitamin D could be given in any form and in any dose. 
We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found three studies with 356 participants. One study took place in Brazil, and the other two in Spain. Two studies had participants with severe COVID‐19 and one had participants with mild COVID‐19 or with no symptoms. All the participants tested positive for COVID‐19 with a laboratory test called ‘PCR’, which is currently the most accurate test available. 
The studies gave their participants different doses of vitamin D. They used different timings from each other, from one large dose in one study to several smaller doses over 14 days in another study. Only two studies said that their participants were vitamin D‐deficient. The other study did not say anything about their participants’ vitamin D status. 
Deaths from any causeWe do not know whether vitamin D helps to prevent death from COVID‐19. Two studies (in participants with severe COVID‐19) provided evidence about deaths from any cause. One reported no deaths in the 50 participants who had received vitamin D, but two  deaths in the 26 participants who received the hospital’s usual COVID‐19 treatment. The other study reported nine deaths in 119 participants who had been given vitamin D and six deaths in the 118 participants given placebo. These studies were too different from each other to allow us to draw any conclusions. 
Patient’s conditionVitamin D may reduce the need for patients to be put on a ventilator to help them breathe, but the evidence is uncertain. One study (in participants with severe COVID‐19) reported that nine out of 119 participants given vitamin D had to be put on a ventilator and 17 out of 118 given a placebo needed a ventilator. 
Unwanted effectsWe do not know whether vitamin D causes unwanted effects. Only one study (in participants with severe COVID‐19) reported data on unwanted effects in a way that we could use. It found that one participant out of 119 vomited shortly after being given vitamin D. 
Quality of lifeNone of the studies reported quality of life. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the evidence is very limited because the studies gave different doses of vitamin D at different times from each other, did not all report participants’ vitamin D status, and did not measure and record their results using consistent methods. 
We found little evidence on unwanted effects and none on quality of life.  
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to 11 March 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD010613.pub2,"Intensity of continuous renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury
What is the issue? 
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is very common among patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU), it is associated with a high death rated and characterised by the rapid loss of the kidney function. Patients with AKI show increased levels of serum uraemic toxins (creatinine and urea), serum potassium and metabolic acids, accumulation of water and in the most cases a reduction in urine output. In this population these chemicals and fluid overload are related to increased rates of death. Theoretically, effective removal of toxins and excess water from the bloodstream might improve patient outcomes (such as mortality rate and recovery of kidney function). 
Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a blood purification technique that enables removal of excess water and toxins. CRRT involves blood being diverted from the patient via a catheter (a hollow, flexible tube placed into a vein) through a filtering system which continuously and steadily removes excess water and toxins; purified blood is then returned to the patient via the catheter. Higher intensity CRRT improves the removal of toxins and excess water. The aim of this review was to investigate the effect of different intensities of CRRT (intensive or less intensive) on death, recovery of kidney function, and adverse events in people with AKI who are critically ill. 
What did we do? 
We searched the literature up until February 2016 and identified six studies enrolling 3185 patients with AKI that were evaluated in this review. 
What did we find? 
Six randomised studies enrolling 3185 participants were included in our review. Compared to less intensive CRRT, intensive CRRT did not reduce the risk of death, improve the recovery of kidney function, or reduce the risk of adverse events (such as bleeding) in patients with AKI. Intensive CRRT was associated with an increased risk of low blood phosphate levels.

Is a Stronger Blood-Cleaning Treatment Better for Very Sick Patients with Sudden Kidney Problems?

**Rationale**

Our kidneys do an important job. They clean our blood all day and night. They take out waste and extra water, which leaves the body as urine.

Sometimes, a person’s kidneys stop working well all of a sudden. This is called acute kidney injury, or AKI. This can happen when a person is already very sick in the hospital. This part of the hospital is often called the intensive care unit, or ICU.

When the kidneys stop working, waste and water build up in the body. This is very dangerous and can cause serious problems. To help, doctors use a special treatment to clean the blood. This treatment is called continuous renal replacement therapy, or CRRT. It acts like an artificial kidney outside the body.

The CRRT machine works all the time. A small, soft tube takes blood from the body to a filter in the machine. The filter cleans out the waste and extra water. Then, the clean blood goes back into the body. Doctors can set the machine to clean the blood at a regular strength or a stronger strength.

Doctors thought that a stronger cleaning might help people get better faster. They did this study to see if a stronger treatment was better and safer than a regular-strength treatment for sick people with AKI.

**Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked very closely at past studies. This helps to get a bigger and more reliable answer.

The researchers found 6 studies to look at. In total, these studies included about 3,200 people. All of these people were very sick adults with sudden kidney problems. They were all being cared for in the ICU.

In the original studies, patients were put into two groups by chance. One group got a stronger, more intense blood-cleaning treatment. The other group got the regular, less intense treatment. The researchers then compared what happened to the people in each group.

**Results**

The researchers looked at the results from all 6 studies. They wanted to know if the stronger treatment helped people more.

The main result was that the stronger blood-cleaning treatment was **not** better than the regular one. People who got the stronger treatment were not more likely to live. Their kidneys also did not get better any faster. The stronger treatment did not reduce the risk of other problems, like bleeding.

The study did find one issue with the stronger treatment. People who got the stronger treatment were more likely to have low levels of phosphate in their blood. Phosphate is a mineral that our bodies need. It helps our bodies make energy and keeps our bones strong. Having too little of it can be a problem.

In the end, this review showed that a stronger treatment did not offer extra help. But it did add an extra risk. This is important information for doctors. It helps them choose the safest and best treatment for very sick patients with sudden kidney failure.","Intensity of continuous renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury

High intake of added sugar have been suggested to impact the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Knowledge on the subject can contribute to preventing CVD. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of a high versus low‐added sugar consumption for primary prevention of CVD in the general population. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science (CPCI‐S) on 2 July 2021. We also conducted a search of ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal for ongoing or unpublished trials. The search was performed together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We imposed no restriction on language of publication or publication status. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over trials, that compared different levels of added sugar intake. Exclusion criteria were: participants aged below 18 years; diabetes mellitus (type 1 and 2); and previous CVD. Primary outcomes were incident cardiovascular events (coronary, carotid, cerebral and peripheral arterial disease) and all‐cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL‐cholesterol, HDL‐cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose and adverse events (gastrointestinal symptoms and impaired dental health). 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 21 RCTs (1110 participants completing the interventions) examining the effects of different levels of added sugar intake with a mean duration of 14 weeks. The study participants were generally described as healthy and the mean age ranged from 22 to 57 years. 
No studies reported on cardiovascular events or all‐cause mortality. There was minimal effect of low intake of added sugar on total cholesterol levels (MD 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.21; I² = 0%; 16 studies; 763 participants; low certainty of evidence) and triglycerides (MD 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.17; I² = 3%; 14 studies; 725 participants) but no evidence of effect on LDL‐cholesterol and HDL‐cholesterol. There was minimal effect on diastolic blood pressure (MD 1.52, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.37; I² = 0%; 13 studies; 873 participants) and on systolic blood pressure (MD 1.44, 95% 0.08 to 2.80; I² = 27%, 14 studies; 873 participants; low certainty of evidence), but no evidence of effect on fasting plasma glucose. 
Only one study reported on dental health, with no events. No other trials reported adverse events (impaired dental health or gastrointestinal symptoms). 
All results were judged as low‐quality evidence according to GRADE. The risk of bias was generally unclear, five studies were classified at an overall low risk of bias (low risk in at least four domains, not including other bias). 
Authors' conclusions
No trials investigating the effect of added sugar on cardiovascular events or all‐cause mortality were identified in our searches. Evidence is uncertain whether low intake of added sugar has an effect on risk factors for CVD; the effect was small and the clinical relevance is, therefore, uncertain. Practical ways to achieve reductions in dietary added sugar includes following current dietary recommendations. 
Future trials should have longer follow‐up time and report on all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular events in order to clarify the effect of added sugar on these outcomes. Future trials should also aim for more direct interventions and preferably be more independent of industry funding.

Looking at Added Sugar and the Risk of Heart and Blood Vessel Problems

### **Rationale**

Heart and blood vessel problems are also known as cardiovascular disease. These problems can be very serious. They can cause a heart attack or a stroke. It is important to find ways to keep the heart and blood vessels healthy.

Many foods and drinks have sugar added to them. Some people think that eating a lot of added sugar may be bad for your heart. This could raise your risk for heart and blood vessel problems over time.

Researchers wanted to find out if this is true. They looked for past studies on this topic. Their main question was: Does eating less added sugar help prevent heart problems in healthy adults? This information is needed to help people make healthy choices about what they eat. It can also help doctors give better advice to their patients.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, the researchers reviewed the results of many past studies. This type of study is called a review. A review helps us see what all the research on a topic says when put together.

The researchers looked for a special type of study. These studies are called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, people are put into groups by chance. This is the best way to compare different treatments or diets.

The studies in this review included healthy adults. These people did not have heart problems or diabetes when the studies began. The average age of the people in the studies was between 22 and 57 years old. In each study, one group of people ate a diet with a low amount of added sugar. The other group ate a diet with a high amount of added sugar. The studies lasted for about 14 weeks, which is about 3 and a half months.

### **Results**

The researchers found 21 studies to look at. Over 1,000 people took part in these studies.

The most important finding was that none of these studies looked at big health events. The studies did not check if eating less sugar stopped heart attacks or strokes. They also did not check if it helped people live longer.

Instead, the studies looked at things that might lead to heart problems. These are called risk factors. They include things like blood pressure and cholesterol. Cholesterol is a fatty substance found in your blood.

The review found that eating less added sugar had only a very small effect. It made a very small change to blood pressure. It also made a very small change to total cholesterol and another type of fat in the blood called triglycerides. Eating less sugar did not seem to change other types of cholesterol or blood sugar levels.

The researchers said the proof from these studies was low-quality. This means we cannot be very sure about these results. The small changes they saw might not be big enough to really help a person’s health. No serious side effects were reported in the studies.

The researchers concluded that we do not have strong proof yet. We still do not know for sure if eating less added sugar prevents heart attacks or helps people live longer. We need new studies to find the answer. These new studies should last for a much longer time. They should also track if people have heart attacks or strokes. This will give us a much clearer picture of how added sugar affects our heart health.","Low levels of sugar to prevent cardiovascular disease
Background 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a group of disorders affecting the heart and blood vessels and the number one cause of death worldwide. It is important to detect modifiable risk factors and find strategies to prevent CVD. There are several established modifiable risk factors for developing CVD, one of them being eating an unhealthy diet rich in sugar. Sugar can be divided in two categories; sugars naturally occurring in food and sugars that are added to food. A high level of added sugar intake is suggested to cause weight gain and affect blood lipids, increasing the risk of CVD. This review assessed different levels of added sugars in the diet and the effect on cardiovascular events (e.g. heart attack or stroke), death, and CVD risk factors in healthy adults. 
Study characteristics 
Databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical trials in which participants are randomly assigned to either an experimental or a control treatment) were searched. The trials that were included compared different levels of added sugar intake and its effect on risk factors for CVD in healthy adults. People with previous CVD or diabetes were not included in the review. 
Key results 
Twenty‐one trials were found with 1110 participants. None of the trials looked at cardiovascular events or death. The trials reported on blood pressure, blood lipid levels and blood sugar levels. The review found that low levels of added sugar intake led to a small reduction in blood pressure and blood lipid levels, but no effect was seen on blood sugar. The evidence is current to July 2021. 
Quality of the evidence 
The studies included in the review provide low‐quality evidence that low levels of added sugar in the diet indirectly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. More long‐term studies of high quality assessing effects of different levels of sugar on CVD risk factors, cardiovascular events and death are needed.

Inability to communicate in a manner that can be understood causes extreme distress for people requiring an artificial airway and has implications for care quality and patient safety. Options for aided communication include non‐vocal, speech‐generating, and voice‐enabling aids. 
Objectives
To assess effectiveness of communication aids for people requiring an artificial airway (endotracheal or tracheostomy tube), defined as the proportion of people able to: use a non‐vocal communication aid to communicate at least one symptom, need, or preference; or use a voice‐enabling communication aid to phonate to produce at least one intelligible word. 
To assess time to communication/phonation; perceptions of communication; communication quality/success; quality of life; psychological distress; length of stay and costs; and adverse events. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library (Wiley version), MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), three other databases, and grey literature from inception to 30 July 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, cluster‐RCTs, controlled non‐randomised parallel group, and before‐after studies evaluating communication aids used in adults with an artificial airway. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. Two review authors independently performed data extraction and assessment of risk of bias. 
Main results
We included 11 studies (1931 participants) conducted in intensive care units (ICUs). Eight evaluated non‐vocal communication aids and three voice‐enabling aids. Usual care was the comparator for all. For six studies, this comprised no aid; usual care in the remaining five studies comprised use of various communication aids. 
Overall, our confidence in results regarding effectiveness of communication interventions was very low due to imprecision, measurement heterogeneity, inconsistency in results, and most studies at high or unclear risk of bias across multiple domains. 
No non‐vocal aid studies reported our primary outcome. We are uncertain of the effects of early use of a voice‐enabling aid compared to routine use on ability to phonate at least one intelligible word (risk ratio (RR) 3.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 50.08; 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Compared to usual care without aids, we are uncertain about effects of a non‐vocal aid (communication board) on patient satisfaction (standardised mean difference (SMD) 2.92, 95% CI 1.52 to 4.33; 4 studies; very low‐certainty evidence). 
No studies of non‐vocal aids reported quality of life. Low‐certainty evidence from two studies suggests early use of a voice‐enabling aid may have no effect on quality of life (MD 2.27, 95% CI –7.21 to 11.75). Conceptual differences in measures of psychological distress precluded data pooling; however, intervention arm participants reported less distress suggesting there might be benefit, but our certainty in the evidence is very low. 
Low‐certainty evidence suggest voice‐enabling aids have little or no effect on ICU length of stay; we were unable to determine effects of non‐vocal aids. Three studies reported different adverse events (physical restraint use, bleeding following tracheostomy, and respiratory parameters indicating respiratory decompensation). Adverse event rates were similar between arms in all three studies. However, uncertainty remains as to any harm associated with communication aids. 
Authors' conclusions
Due to a lack of high‐quality studies, imprecision, inconsistency of results, and measurement heterogeneity,  the evidence provides insufficient information to guide practice as to which communication aid is more appropriate and when to use them. Understanding effectiveness of communication aids would benefit from development of a core outcome measurement set.

### **Plain Title**

A Study of Tools to Help Patients with Breathing Tubes Communicate

### **Rationale**

**Why was this study done?**

When a person is very sick, they may need a breathing tube in their throat to help them breathe. This tube is also called an artificial airway. The tube passes through the vocal cords, so people with one cannot talk.

Not being able to talk can be very stressful and scary. Patients cannot tell doctors or nurses if they are in pain. They cannot share their needs or feelings. This can make their care less safe.

There are special tools that can help patients with breathing tubes communicate. Some tools help people communicate without using their voice. For example, they might use a board with pictures or letters to point at. Other tools are designed to help patients make sounds and speak words. These are called voice-enabling tools.

Researchers wanted to know if these communication tools really work. They wanted to find out which tools are best and when they should be used. This information could help doctors and nurses give better care to patients who cannot speak.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This study was a review. This means the researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they gathered and studied the results from other studies that were already finished.

The researchers looked for studies about communication tools. They found 11 studies to include in their review. Together, these studies had a total of about 1,931 adult patients.

All the patients in these studies were very sick and were being cared for in a hospital’s intensive care unit, or ICU. Every patient had a breathing tube and could not talk.

In each study, patients were put into two groups. One group was given a communication tool to use. The other group received the usual care. For some studies, usual care meant using no tools at all. In other studies, it meant using a mix of basic communication methods.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

After reviewing all 11 studies, the researchers could not be sure if the communication tools were helpful. This was because many of the studies they looked at were small or had weaknesses in how they were done. This makes it hard to trust the results. The researchers said they have very low confidence in the findings.

**Tools that help people communicate without their voice**
The studies on tools like picture boards did not say if they helped patients communicate their needs. Researchers were also uncertain if these tools helped patients feel more satisfied with their communication.

**Tools that help people use their voice**
The researchers were also not sure if the voice-enabling tools helped patients speak words that could be understood. There was some evidence that these tools did not make patients feel better or improve their quality of life. These tools also did not seem to help people leave the ICU any sooner.

**Were the tools safe?**
The studies looked to see if the tools caused any harm or bad side effects. The researchers found no clear proof that the tools were harmful. The number of bad side effects was about the same for patients who used the tools and those who did not. However, the researchers are still not certain about the safety of these tools.

**What did the researchers conclude?**
The researchers concluded that there is not enough good information to know which communication tools are best for patients with breathing tubes. There is also not enough proof to guide doctors on when to use them.

More and better studies are needed to answer these questions. The researchers suggest that for future studies, all scientists should agree to measure the same things in the same way. This would make it easier to combine their results and find clear answers for patients and their families.","Strategies to help adults with a breathing tube to communicate
What is the issue? 
Patients needing a machine to support breathing cannot speak due to a tube delivering gas to the lungs bypassing their voice box. Patients mouth words, gesture, and use facial expressions. However, these are very difficult to understand. Weakened muscles and difficulty concentrating, which are common in critical illness, makes using aids such as writing equipment or communication boards difficult. Consistent evidence on which communication aids are effective is lacking. 
Why is this important? 
Difficulty communicating places people at increased risk of harm, causes distress to patients and family, and causes stress for healthcare staff. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for studies (to 30 July 2020) exploring aids used to help people with a breathing tube to communicate. We found 11 studies involving 1931 participants admitted to intensive care units. We also looked for studies involving people needing a breathing tube and living at home or in long‐term care, but found none. Eight studies used communication boards or apps. Three studies used aids that help a patient to speak with the breathing tube in place. All studies compared the communication aid to routine communication practices. For six studies, routine practice did not include use of any type of communication aid. For the remaining five studies, usual care comprised a range of communication aids routinely used in the participating intensive care units including a communication board, paper notepad, and routine timing of the use of speech aids. We are unsure about whether the early use of aids to help with speaking may increase the number of people who can say words that can be understood or shorten the time to be able to speak. The evidence was of very low quality. 
Similarly, compared to routine care in which an aid is not used, we are uncertain about the effects of communication boards on patient satisfaction. We are not sure about the effect on psychological distress and quality of life due to uncertainty in the evidence. Communication aids that help people to speak may have little or no effect on intensive care unit length of stay (low‐quality evidence). We are uncertain of possible harms  with use of communication aids as only three studies reported this, and all measured different adverse events, and two were very small studies. 
What does this mean? 
We are unsure whether using speaking aids in intensive care might increase the number of people who can say words that can be understood. Use of communication boards may increase patient satisfaction, but we are not sure of these findings because of very low‐quality evidence. This means further studies are likely to change our understanding of the effects of communication aids. More studies are needed to understand the effects of communication aids, particularly effects on psychological well‐being and people's ability to communicate.

10.1002-14651858.CD013243.pub2,"Background
Dementia is a chronic condition which progressively affects memory and other cognitive functions, social behaviour, and ability to carry out daily activities. To date, no treatment is clearly effective in preventing progression of the disease, and most treatments are symptomatic, often aiming to improve people's psychological symptoms or behaviours which are challenging for carers. A range of new therapeutic strategies has been evaluated in research, and the use of trained animals in therapy sessions, termed animal‐assisted therapy (AAT), is receiving increasing attention. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of animal‐assisted therapy for people with dementia.
Search methods
We searched ALOIS: the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register on 5 September 2019. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of major healthcare databases, trial registries, and grey literature sources. We also searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), ISI Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO's trial registry portal. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐randomised trials, and randomised cross‐over trials that compared AAT versus no AAT, AAT using live animals versus alternatives such as robots or toys, or AAT versus any other active intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data using the standard methods of Cochrane Dementia. Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of the retrieved records. We expressed our results using mean difference (MD), standardised mean difference (SMD), and risk ratio (RR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) where appropriate. 
Main results
We included nine RCTs from 10 reports. All nine studies were conducted in Europe and the US. Six studies were parallel‐group, individually randomised RCTs; one was a randomised cross‐over trial; and two were cluster‐RCTs that were possibly related where randomisation took place at the level of the day care and nursing home. We identified two ongoing trials from trial registries. 
There were three comparisons: AAT versus no AAT (standard care or various non‐animal‐related activities), AAT using live animals versus robotic animals, and AAT using live animals versus the use of a soft animal toy. The studies evaluated 305 participants with dementia. One study used horses and the remainder used dogs as the therapy animal. The duration of the intervention ranged from six weeks to six months, and the therapy sessions lasted between 10 and 90 minutes each, with a frequency ranging from one session every two weeks to two sessions per week. There was a wide variety of instruments used to measure the outcomes. All studies were at high risk of performance bias and unclear risk of selection bias. Our certainty about the results for all major outcomes was very low to moderate. 
Comparing AAT versus no AAT, participants who received AAT may be slightly less depressed after the intervention (MD –2.87, 95% CI –5.24 to –0.50; 2 studies, 83 participants; low‐certainty evidence), but they did not appear to have improved quality of life (MD 0.45, 95% CI –1.28 to 2.18; 3 studies, 164 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no clear differences in all other major outcomes, including social functioning (MD –0.40, 95% CI –3.41 to 2.61; 1 study, 58 participants; low‐certainty evidence), problematic behaviour (SMD –0.34, 95% CI –0.98 to 0.30; 3 studies, 142 participants; very‐low‐certainty evidence), agitation (SMD –0.39, 95% CI –0.89 to 0.10; 3 studies, 143 participants; very‐low‐certainty evidence), activities of daily living (MD 4.65, 95% CI –16.05 to 25.35; 1 study, 37 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and self‐care ability (MD 2.20, 95% CI –1.23 to 5.63; 1 study, 58 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There were no data on adverse events. 
Comparing AAT using live animals versus robotic animals, one study (68 participants) found mixed effects on social function, with longer duration of physical contact but shorter duration of talking in participants who received AAT using live animals versus robotic animals (median: 93 seconds with live versus 28 seconds with robotic for physical contact; 164 seconds with live versus 206 seconds with robotic for talk directed at a person; 263 seconds with live versus 307 seconds with robotic for talk in total). Another study showed no clear differences between groups in behaviour measured using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (MD –6.96, 95% CI –14.58 to 0.66; 78 participants; low‐certainty evidence) or quality of life (MD –2.42, 95% CI –5.71 to 0.87; 78 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There were no data on the other outcomes. 
Comparing AAT using live animals versus a soft toy cat, one study (64 participants) evaluated only social functioning, in the form of duration of contact and talking. The data were expressed as median and interquartile ranges. Duration of contact was slightly longer in participants in the AAT group and duration of talking slightly longer in those exposed to the toy cat. This was low‐certainty evidence. 
Authors' conclusions
We found low‐certainty evidence that AAT may slightly reduce depressive symptoms in people with dementia. We found no clear evidence that AAT affects other outcomes in this population, with our certainty in the evidence ranging from very‐low to moderate depending on the outcome. We found no evidence on safety or effects on the animals. Therefore, clear conclusions cannot yet be drawn about the overall benefits and risks of AAT in people with dementia. Further well‐conducted RCTs are needed to improve the certainty of the evidence. In view of the difficulty in achieving blinding of participants and personnel in such trials, future RCTs should work on blinding outcome assessors, document allocation methods clearly, and include major patient‐important outcomes such as affect, emotional and social functioning, quality of life, adverse events, and outcomes for animals.

### Plain Title

Can spending time with animals help people with dementia?

### Rationale

Dementia is a health problem that affects the brain. It can make it hard for a person to remember things. It can also change how a person acts and feels. Over time, it can make it hard to do daily tasks.

Right now, there is no cure for dementia. The treatments we have now mainly help with some of the symptoms. They do not stop the sickness from getting worse. This is a burden for people with dementia and for those who care for them.

Doctors and scientists are looking for new ways to help. One idea is called animal-assisted therapy. This is when trained animals, like dogs, are used in therapy sessions. The goal is to help people feel better.

This study wanted to find out if animal therapy really works for people with dementia. Researchers looked at all the best studies that have been done on this topic. They wanted to know if this therapy helps people and if it is safe.

### Trial Design

This was not a new study with its own patients. Instead, the researchers did a review. This means they searched for all the studies that had already been done on this topic. They put the results of these studies together to get a clearer answer.

The researchers looked for studies where people with dementia were put into different groups by chance. This is a fair way to compare a new treatment to the usual care. They found 9 studies to include in their review. In total, these studies had 305 people with dementia.

The studies compared a few different things:
*   Some compared a group of people who got animal therapy to a group that got the usual care or did other activities.
*   Some compared therapy with a real animal to therapy with a robot animal.
*   One study compared therapy with a real animal to therapy with a soft toy animal.

Most of the studies used dogs. One study used horses. The therapy sessions lasted for different amounts of time. In some studies, people had therapy for 6 weeks. In others, they had it for 6 months.

### Results

The researchers found that the studies they reviewed were not perfect. This means we cannot be fully sure about the results. The proof from the studies was weak.

Here is what the review found:

People who had therapy with animals may have felt a little less sad. This was the main positive finding. But because the proof was weak, we cannot be sure of this benefit.

For other things, there was no clear proof that animal therapy helped. It did not seem to improve a person’s quality of life. It also did not seem to help with their social skills, their behavior, or their ability to do daily tasks on their own.

When comparing real animals to robot or toy animals, the results were mixed. People touched the real animals more. But they sometimes talked less than they did with the robot or toy animals. There was no clear difference in how these therapies affected people’s mood or behavior.

Importantly, none of the studies talked about safety. We do not know if the animal therapy caused any bad side effects for the people in the studies. We also do not know how the therapy affected the animals.

The researchers who did this review concluded that we cannot say for sure if animal therapy helps people with dementia. It might help a little with feeling sad. But we need more and better studies to know for sure. Future studies should be done very carefully to give us clearer answers about the benefits and risks.","Animal‐assisted therapy for people with dementia
Review question 
Do therapy sessions that involve live animals help people with dementia?
Background 
Dementia is an increasingly common condition across the world. People with dementia have progressive loss of the ability to think, remember, and communicate; to manage their daily activities; and to mix successfully with other people. Many people with dementia also develop depression and related problems. To date, no treatment has proven able to cure the disease or stop it from getting worse. However, many treatments are in use which aim to improve the well‐being of people with dementia and the people who look after them. Animal‐assisted therapy (AAT) is one of the types of treatment that has been studied. It is thought that animals could help people with dementia by providing companionship and support in daily activities and that this might lead to improvements in physical and mental health, including better mood and fewer problematic behaviours. 
Search date 
We searched medical databases to September 2019.
Key characteristics of included studies 
We included nine randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), involving 305 people with dementia, which compared AAT to a control treatment (either usual care or an alternative treatment). All studies took place in Europe or the US. Seven studies compared AAT to usual care or to another activity which had nothing to do with animals. Two studies compared AAT (using live animals) to the use of robotic animals. One study compared AAT to the use of a soft toy cat. There were some features of the studies which could have biased the results. Study participants and care staff knew what treatment a person was receiving and this might have affected some results. Also, it was not always clear that the randomisation to treatments had been done as well as possible. 
Funding sources 
The studies received funding from various sources, including research grants (four studies), personal donation (one study), and support from an institute that promotes AAT (two studies). Two studies did not describe how they were funded. 
Key results 
We found evidence from two studies with 83 participants that people with dementia who had AAT were possibly slightly less depressed at the end of treatment than people who had standard care or other interventions not related to animals. We also found evidence from three studies with 164 participants that people who received AAT had no clear difference in their quality of life compared to those who did not. However, we found no evidence of an effect on social functioning (interactions with their environment and families), behaviour, agitation, activities of daily living, self‐care ability or balance. There were no clear differences when AAT was compared with the use of a robotic animal in two studies with 156 participants (in social functioning, behaviour, and quality of life), or with the use of a soft toy cat in one study with 64 participants (in social functioning). There were no data on harmful effects of the treatment on the participants and nothing was reported about the effect on the animals in any study. 
Certainty of the evidence 
We took several factors into account when deciding how certain we could be of our results. In this review, two main factors reduced our level of certainty. First, for all the outcomes we looked at, there was only a small number of studies and participants. Second, we thought there was a significant risk that all of the results could have been biased by the way the studies were designed or conducted. For a few outcomes, our confidence was also reduced by inconsistent results between studies. Overall, our certainty about the results ranged from very low to moderate. 
Conclusions 
AAT may slightly reduce depressive symptoms. Otherwise, no conclusions can yet be drawn on whether AAT is beneficial or safe for people with dementia. The small size of the included studies, and the diversity of outcomes and outcome measures, were major issues. We recommend further well‐conducted studies with the inclusion of important outcomes such as emotional and social well‐being, quality of life, side effects, and effects on the animals.

Background 
Adults with an intellectual disability often have difficulty in receiving the healthcare they need. Compared to other adults who do not have an intellectual disability, they have poorer health and have more difficulty finding, getting to, and paying for healthcare. This happens for both physical and mental healthcare needs. 
Review question 
We conducted a review of the literature to assess the effects of different ways to organise services. This is the first update of a previously published review. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for all relevant studies until 4 September 2015. We found seven studies, six of which we identified previously and one retrieved for this update. All of the studies assessed the impact of the intervention on the mental health of persons with an intellectual disability; none considered the physical health. Those studies used different interventions, including giving persons with an intellectual disability more health services, psychological support, and treating them at home, instead of at the hospital. Studies mainly looked at how the interventions helped the behavioural problems of those with an intellectual disability, how much burden they caused the care givers, and how much they cost. No study assessed adverse events. 
Key results 
Community‐based behaviour therapy might decrease behavioural problems. We are uncertain whether other interventions make any difference in reducing behavioural problems. There was limited evidence about how those interventions helped care givers to deal with the burden of caring for their relatives with an intellectual disability, or how much they might cost compared with the usual care already provided. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is little information on different ways to organise services for people with intellectual disabilities. Most studies focused on people who had intellectual disabilities and mental health problems. There were no studies on people who had intellectual disabilities and physical problems.

Finding Better Ways to Give Health Care to Adults with Learning Problems

**Rationale**

Some adults have a condition that makes it hard for them to learn. This is called an intellectual disability. These adults often have more health problems than other people. But they can have a hard time getting the good health care they need.

It can be hard for them to find the right doctor. It can be hard to get to the doctor’s office. And it can be hard to pay for their care. This is true for problems with their body (physical health) and problems with their feelings (mental health).

Researchers wanted to find out if there are better ways to set up health care for adults with an intellectual disability. They looked at past studies to see what types of support worked best. This information is needed to help make sure all adults get the care they need to be healthy.

**Trial Design**

This study was a review. This means the researchers did not work with new people. Instead, they looked for and studied research that was already finished. They gathered all the useful studies they could find up to September 2015.

The researchers found seven studies that fit what they were looking for. All seven of these studies looked at adults with an intellectual disability. All the studies focused on help for mental health problems, like stress or behavior issues. None of the studies looked at help for physical health problems, like the flu or an injury.

The studies tested different ways to help. Some studies gave people more health services. Others gave them talk therapy to help with feelings. Some studies had doctors treat people at their own homes instead of at a hospital. The researchers looked to see if these new ways helped people’s behavior. They also looked at how the new ways affected family members who care for them.

**Results**

The researchers found some useful information. One type of help, called community-based behavior therapy, seemed to help. This is a kind of support that helps people with their actions and feelings. This support is given in a person's own town or home, not in a hospital. The review showed this type of therapy might help lower the number of behavior problems a person has.

For the other types of support, the researchers were not sure if they worked. There was not enough information to say if they helped reduce behavior problems.

There was also very little information about other important things. The studies did not show if the new ways of helping made things easier for family or caregivers. The studies also did not have much information on whether the new ways cost more or less than the usual care. Also, none of the studies reported on any bad side effects from the different types of support.

The main conclusion is that we need to learn more. There is not much research on the best way to give health care to adults with intellectual disabilities. We especially need more studies on how to help with their physical health problems.","Healthcare services for adults with an intellectual disability

10.1002-14651858.CD015017.pub3,"Background
Ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent, inhibits the replication of viruses in vitro. The molecular hypothesis of ivermectin's antiviral mode of action suggests an inhibitory effect on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) replication in early stages of infection. Currently, evidence on ivermectin for prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 treatment is conflicting. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo, or any other proven intervention for people with COVID‐19 receiving treatment as inpatients or outpatients, and for prevention of an infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 (postexposure prophylaxis). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, Web of Science (Emerging Citation Index and Science Citation Index), WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, and HTA database weekly to identify completed and ongoing trials without language restrictions to 16 December 2021. Additionally, we included trials with > 1000 participants up to April 2022. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ivermectin to standard of care, placebo, or another proven intervention for treatment of people with confirmed COVID‐19 diagnosis, irrespective of disease severity or treatment setting, and for prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Co‐interventions had to be the same in both study arms.  
For this review update, we reappraised eligible trials for research integrity: only RCTs prospectively registered in a trial registry according to WHO guidelines for clinical trial registration were eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
We assessed RCTs for bias, using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We used GRADE to rate the certainty of evidence for outcomes in the following settings and populations: 1) to treat inpatients with moderate‐to‐severe COVID‐19, 2) to treat outpatients with mild COVID‐19 (outcomes: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, (serious) adverse events, quality of life, and viral clearance), and 3) to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (outcomes: SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, development of COVID‐19 symptoms, admission to hospital, mortality, adverse events and quality of life). 
Main results
We excluded seven of the 14 trials included in the previous review version; six were not prospectively registered and one was non‐randomized. This updated review includes 11 trials with 3409 participants investigating ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo. No trial investigated ivermectin for prevention of infection or compared ivermectin to an intervention with proven efficacy. Five trials treated participants with moderate COVID‐19 (inpatient settings); six treated mild COVID‐19 (outpatient settings). Eight trials were double‐blind and placebo‐controlled, and three were open‐label. We assessed around 50% of the trial results as low risk of bias. 
We identified 31 ongoing trials. In addition, there are 28 potentially eligible trials without publication of results, or with disparities in the reporting of the methods and results, held in ‘awaiting classification’ until the trial authors clarify questions upon request.

We are uncertain whether ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo reduces or increases all‐cause mortality at 28 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 2.51; 3 trials, 230 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); or clinical worsening, assessed by participants with new need for invasive mechanical ventilation or death at day 28 (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.04; 2 trials, 118 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); or serious adverse events during the trial period (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.07 to 35.89; 2 trials, 197 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus placebo may have little or no effect on clinical improvement, assessed by the number of participants discharged alive at day 28 (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.35; 1 trial, 73 participants; low‐certainty evidence); on any adverse events during the trial period (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.79; 3 trials, 228 participants; low‐certainty evidence); and on viral clearance at 7 days (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.58; 3 trials, 231 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No trial investigated quality of life at any time point. 
Ivermectin for treating COVID‐19 in outpatient settings with asymptomatic or mild disease 
Ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo probably has little or no effect on all‐cause mortality at day 28 (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.25; 6 trials, 2860 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and little or no effect on quality of life, measured with the PROMIS Global‐10 scale (physical component mean difference (MD) 0.00, 95% CI ‐0.98 to 0.98; and mental component MD 0.00, 95% CI ‐1.08 to 1.08; 1358 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Ivermectin may have little or no effect on clinical worsening, assessed by admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.20 to 6.02; 2 trials, 590 participants; low‐certainty evidence); on clinical improvement, assessed by the number of participants with all initial symptoms resolved up to 14 days (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.36; 2 trials, 478 participants; low‐certainty evidence); on serious adverse events (RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.62 to 8.31; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low‐certainty evidence); on any adverse events during the trial period (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.76; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low‐certainty evidence); and on viral clearance at day 7 compared to placebo (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.48; 2 trials, 331 participants; low‐certainty evidence). None of the trials reporting duration of symptoms were eligible for meta‐analysis. 
Authors' conclusions
For outpatients, there is currently low‐ to high‐certainty evidence that ivermectin has no beneficial effect for people with COVID‐19. Based on the very low‐certainty evidence for inpatients, we are still uncertain whether ivermectin prevents death or clinical worsening or increases serious adverse events, while there is low‐certainty evidence that it has no beneficial effect regarding clinical improvement, viral clearance and adverse events. No evidence is available on ivermectin to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. In this update, certainty of evidence increased through higher quality trials including more participants. According to this review's living approach, we will continually update our search. 
","Here is the Plain Language Summary based on the provided abstract.

### **Plain Title**

Does a drug called ivermectin help treat or prevent COVID-19? A review of the research.

### **Rationale**

COVID-19 is an illness caused by a virus. It has made many people around the world very sick. Doctors have been looking for medicines to treat it.

Ivermectin is a drug that doctors use to treat infections from parasites. Some early tests in a lab showed that ivermectin might stop the COVID-19 virus from making copies of itself. However, when doctors gave the drug to people, the results were not clear. Some studies said it worked, and others said it did not.

Because of these mixed results, researchers wanted to find a clear answer. They did this review to bring together all the best and most trustworthy studies. They wanted to find out if ivermectin is a safe and helpful treatment for people with COVID-19. This information can help doctors and patients make better decisions about care.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results from other studies that were already finished. They only included the best type of studies, called randomized controlled trials.

In these kinds of studies, people are put into groups by chance, like flipping a coin. One group of patients got ivermectin plus the usual medical care. The other group got the usual medical care plus a fake pill, which is called a placebo. A placebo looks like the real drug but has no medicine in it. Comparing the groups helps researchers see if the drug itself made a difference.

This review looked at 11 different studies. In total, these studies included about 3,400 people with COVID-19. Some of these people were very sick in the hospital. Others had a mild illness and were recovering at home. Doctors usually checked on the patients for about one month to see how they were doing.

### **Results**

The researchers looked at the results for two different groups of patients: very sick people in the hospital and people with mild illness at home.

**For sick people treated in the hospital:**
The evidence from these studies was not very strong. This means we cannot be sure about the results.
*   The researchers were uncertain if ivermectin helped these patients live longer.
*   They were also uncertain if it stopped patients from getting sicker and needing a breathing machine.
*   It was not clear if ivermectin caused any serious side effects.
*   Overall, for very sick patients in the hospital, there was not enough good information to know if ivermectin helps or harms.

**For people with mild illness treated at home:**
The evidence for this group was much stronger and clearer.
*   The results showed that ivermectin likely has little to no effect.
*   It did not lower the number of people who died from COVID-19.
*   It did not help people get better faster or stop them from having to go to the hospital.
*   It also did not affect their quality of life or help their bodies clear the virus any quicker than a fake pill.

**For preventing COVID-19:**
The researchers looked for studies about whether ivermectin could stop people from getting infected in the first place. They did not find any good studies on this topic. So, we do not know if ivermectin can prevent a COVID-19 infection.

**Main Conclusions from the Researchers**
Based on this review, the authors concluded that ivermectin is not a helpful treatment for people with mild COVID-19. For sicker people in the hospital, we still do not have a clear answer because the evidence is too weak. More and better research is needed to know for sure.","Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID‐19
Is ivermectin effective for COVID‐19? 
Key messages 
We found no evidence to support the use of ivermectin for treating COVID‐19 or preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The evidence base improved slightly in this update, but is still limited. 
Evaluation of ivermectin is continuing in 31 ongoing trials, and we will update this review again when their results become available.  
What is ivermectin? 
Ivermectin is a medicine used to treat parasites, such as intestinal parasites in animals, and scabies in humans. It is inexpensive and is widely used in regions of the world where parasitic infestations are common. It has few unwanted effects.  
Medical regulators have not approved ivermectin for COVID‐19.
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to update our knowledge of whether ivermectin reduces death, illness, and length of infection in people with COVID‐19, or is useful in prevention of the infection. We included trials comparing the medicine to placebo (dummy treatment), usual care, or treatments for COVID‐19 that are known to work to some extent, such as dexamethasone. We excluded trials comparing ivermectin to other medicines that do not work, like hydroxychloroquine, or whose effectiveness against COVID‐19 is uncertain. 
We evaluated the effects of ivermectin in infected people on:
– people dying;– whether people's COVID‐19 got better or worse;– quality of life;– serious and non‐serious unwanted effects;– viral clearance. 
For prevention, we sought the effect on preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease. 
What did we do?  
We searched for randomized controlled trials that investigated ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID‐19. People treated in hospital or as outpatients had to have laboratory‐confirmed COVID‐19. 
In this update, we also investigated the trustworthiness of the trials and only included them if they fulfilled clear ethical and scientific criteria. 
We compared and summarized the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on common criteria such as trial methods and sizes. 
What did we find?  
We excluded seven of the 14 trials included in the previous review as these trials did not fulfil the expected ethical and scientific criteria. Together with four new trials, we included 11 trials with 3409 participants that investigated ivermectin combined with any usual care compared to the same usual care or placebo. 
For treatment, there were five trials of people in hospital with moderate COVID‐19 and six trials of outpatients with mild COVID‐19. The trials used different doses of ivermectin and different durations of treatment.  
No trial investigated ivermectin to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.
We also found 31 ongoing trials, and an additional 28 trials still requiring clarification from the authors or not yet published. 
Main results  
Treating people in hospital with COVID‐19 
We do not know whether ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment: 
– leads to more or fewer deaths (3 trials, 230 people); – worsens or improves patients' condition, assessed by need for ventilation or death (2 trials, 118 people);– increases or reduces serious unwanted events (2 trials, 197 people). 
Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, may make little or no difference to: 
– improving patients' condition, assessed by discharge from hospital (1 trial, 73 people);– non‐serious unwanted events (3 trials, 228 participants).  
Seven days after treatment, ivermectin may make little or no difference to reduction of negative COVID‐19 tests (3 trials, 231 participants) compared with placebo or usual care. 
Treating outpatients with COVID‐19 
Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, probably makes little or no difference to people dying (6 trials, 2860 people). 
Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, makes little or no difference to quality of life (1 trial, 1358 people). 
Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, may make little or no difference to: 
– worsening patients' condition, assessed by admission to hospital or death (2 trials, 590 people);– serious unwanted events (5 trials, 1502 people); – non‐serious unwanted events (5 trials, 1502 participants); – improving people's COVID‐19 symptoms in the 14 days after treatment (2 trials, 478 people);– number of people with negative COVID‐19 tests 7 days after treatment (2 trials, 331 people). 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the evidence, especially for outpatients, improved since the last review version, because we could look at more participants included in high‐quality trials. Although we are quite certain regarding our results on risk of people dying and quality of life, the confidence in the evidence is still low for many other outpatient and inpatient outcomes because there were only few events measured. The methods differed between trials, and they did not report everything we were interested in, such as relevant outcomes. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The systematic literature search is up to date to 16 December 2021. Additionally, we included trials with > 1000 participants up to April 2022.

10.1002-14651858.MR000051.pub2,"Background
Trial monitoring is an important component of good clinical practice to ensure the safety and rights of study participants, confidentiality of personal information, and quality of data. However, the effectiveness of various existing monitoring approaches is unclear. Information to guide the choice of monitoring methods in clinical intervention studies may help trialists, support units, and monitors to effectively adjust their approaches to current knowledge and evidence. 
Objectives
To evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of different monitoring strategies (including risk‐based strategies and others) for clinical intervention studies examined in prospective comparative studies of monitoring interventions. 
Search methods
We systematically searched CENTRAL, PubMed, and Embase via Elsevier for relevant published literature up to March 2021. We searched the online 'Studies within A Trial' (SWAT) repository, grey literature, and trial registries for ongoing or unpublished studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized or non‐randomized prospective, empirical evaluation studies of different monitoring strategies in one or more clinical intervention studies. We applied no restrictions for language or date of publication. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data on the evaluated monitoring methods, countries involved, study population, study setting, randomization method, and numbers and proportions in each intervention group. Our primary outcome was critical and major monitoring findings in prospective intervention studies. Monitoring findings were classified according to different error domains (e.g. major eligibility violations) and the primary outcome measure was a composite of these domains. Secondary outcomes were individual error domains, participant recruitment and follow‐up, and resource use. If we identified more than one study for a comparison and outcome definitions were similar across identified studies, we quantitatively summarized effects in a meta‐analysis using a random‐effects model. Otherwise, we qualitatively summarized the results of eligible studies stratified by different comparisons of monitoring strategies. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for different groups of comparisons. 
Main results
We identified eight eligible studies, which we grouped into five comparisons.
1. Risk‐based versus extensive on‐site monitoring: based on two large studies, we found moderate certainty of evidence for the combined primary outcome of major or critical findings that risk‐based monitoring is not inferior to extensive on‐site monitoring. Although the risk ratio was close to 'no difference' (1.03 with a 95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.81 to 1.33, below 1.0 in favor of the risk‐based strategy), the high imprecision in one study and the small number of eligible studies resulted in a wide CI of the summary estimate. Low certainty of evidence suggested that monitoring strategies with extensive on‐site monitoring were associated with considerably higher resource use and costs (up to a factor of 3.4). Data on recruitment or retention of trial participants were not available. 
2. Central monitoring with triggered on‐site visits versus regular on‐site visits: combining the results of two eligible studies yielded low certainty of evidence with a risk ratio of 1.83 (95% CI 0.51 to 6.55) in favor of triggered monitoring intervention. Data on recruitment, retention, and resource use were not available. 
3. Central statistical monitoring and local monitoring performed by site staff with annual on‐site visits versus central statistical monitoring and local monitoring only: based on one study, there was moderate certainty of evidence that a small number of major and critical findings were missed with the central monitoring approach without on‐site visits: 3.8% of participants in the group without on‐site visits and 6.4% in the group with on‐site visits had a major or critical monitoring finding (odds ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.7; P = 0.03). The absolute number of monitoring findings was very low, probably because defined major and critical findings were very study specific and central monitoring was present in both intervention groups. Very low certainty of evidence did not suggest a relevant effect on participant retention, and very low‐quality evidence indicated an extra cost for on‐site visits of USD 2,035,392. There were no data on recruitment. 
4. Traditional 100% source data verification (SDV) versus targeted or remote SDV: the two studies assessing targeted and remote SDV reported findings only related to source documents. Compared to the final database obtained using the full SDV monitoring process, only a small proportion of remaining errors on overall data were identified using the targeted SDV process in the MONITORING study (absolute difference 1.47%, 95% CI 1.41% to 1.53%). Targeted SDV was effective in the verification of source documents but increased the workload on data management. The other included study was a pilot study which compared traditional on‐site SDV versus remote SDV and found little difference in monitoring findings and the ability to locate data values despite marked differences in remote access in two clinical trial networks. There were no data on recruitment or retention. 
5. Systematic on‐site initiation visit versus on‐site initiation visit upon request: very low certainty of evidence suggested no difference in retention and recruitment between the two approaches. There were no data on critical and major findings or on resource use. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence base is limited in terms of quantity and quality. Ideally, for each of the five identified comparisons, more prospective, comparative monitoring studies nested in clinical trials and measuring effects on all outcomes specified in this review are necessary to draw more reliable conclusions. However, the results suggesting risk‐based, targeted, and mainly central monitoring as an efficient strategy are promising. The development of reliable triggers for on‐site visits is ongoing; different triggers might be used in different settings. More evidence on risk indicators that identify sites with problems or the prognostic value of triggers is needed to further optimize central monitoring strategies. In particular, approaches with an initial assessment of trial‐specific risks that need to be closely monitored centrally during trial conduct with triggered on‐site visits should be evaluated in future research.

Finding the Best Way to Check on Medical Studies to Keep People Safe

### **Rationale**

**Why do we need to check on medical studies?**

Medical studies, also called clinical trials, help us find new ways to treat diseases. When people join a study, it is very important to keep them safe. We also need to protect their private information. And we must make sure the information we collect in the study is correct.

To do this, experts check on, or ""monitor,"" the study while it is happening. There are many ways to monitor a study. Some ways involve visiting the study clinic in person to check everything. Other ways involve checking the study’s information from a main office using computers.

**Why was this research done?**

We do not know for sure which way of monitoring is best. Some methods cost a lot of money and take a lot of time. Researchers wanted to find out if newer, simpler ways of monitoring are as good as the older, more complex ways.

This research looked at the good and bad sides of different monitoring methods. The goal was to find the best ways to keep people safe and make sure study results are right. This can help make future medical studies better and more efficient.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a study with new patients. Instead, the researchers looked for all the studies that were already done on this topic. They did a large search for studies that compared different ways of monitoring clinical trials.

The researchers found 8 studies that fit their goal. They collected all the results from these 8 studies. Then, they put all the information together to get a clearer picture of what works best. This type of study is called a review. It helps us see what we have learned from many studies over time.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The researchers grouped the 8 studies into 5 main comparisons. Overall, the results showed that newer, more focused ways of checking on studies seem to be as good and safe as older ways. These newer methods can also save a lot of time and money.

Here is what the researchers found for each comparison:

1.  **Checking based on risk vs. checking everything in person.**
    Some studies were checked based on their level of risk. This means checkers focused only on the most important things. Other studies were checked by having someone visit the clinic to review everything in person. The review found that checking based on risk was just as good at finding major problems. It also cost much less money.

2.  **Visiting a clinic only when a problem is found vs. regular visits.**
    The results suggest that it might be better to only visit a study clinic when a problem is flagged. This is instead of having regular visits all the time. But the researchers said we need more studies to be sure about this.

3.  **Checking from a main office with vs. without a yearly visit.**
    Checking from a main office with one yearly visit found a few more problems than checking from an office without any visits. But the number of problems was very low in both groups. The yearly visits cost over 2 million extra dollars.

4.  **Checking all study information vs. checking only some key information.**
    Checking only some of the most important study information worked well to find mistakes. This saved a lot of work compared to checking 100% of the information.

5.  **A starting visit for all study sites vs. a visit only if the site asks for one.**
    There was no real difference seen between these two approaches. It did not seem to affect how many people stayed in the studies.

**What do these results mean?**

The authors of this review feel that we still need more research to be certain. There are not enough high-quality studies on this topic yet.

However, the results so far are a good sign. They show that we can use smarter, more focused ways to check on medical studies. Checking based on risk and checking from a main office seem to work well. These methods can keep patients safe and make sure study results are right. They can also help studies cost less. This frees up money and time for more research to help find new treatments for patients.","New monitoring strategies for clinical trials
Our question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effects of new monitoring strategies on monitoring findings, participant recruitment, participant follow‐up, and resource use in clinical trials. We also summarized the different components of tested strategies and qualitative evidence from process evaluations. 
Background 
Monitoring a clinical trial is important to ensure the safety of participants and the reliability of results. New methods have been developed for monitoring practices but further assessments of these new methods are needed to see if they do improve effectiveness without being inferior to established methods in terms of patient rights and safety, and quality assurance of trial results. We reviewed studies that examined this question within clinical trials, i.e. studies comparing different monitoring strategies used in clinical trials. 
Study characteristics 
We included eight studies which covered a variety of monitoring strategies in a wide range of clinical trials, including national and large international trials. They included primary (general), secondary (specialized), and tertiary (highly specialized) health care. The size of the studies ranged from 32 to 4371 participants at one to 196 sites. 
Key results 
We identified five comparisons. The first comparison of risk‐based monitoring versus extensive on‐site monitoring found no evidence that the risk‐based approach is inferior to extensive on‐site monitoring in terms of the proportion of participants with a critical or major monitoring finding not identified by the corresponding method, while resource use was three‐ to five‐fold higher with extensive on‐site monitoring. For the second comparison of central statistical monitoring with triggered on‐site visits versus regular (untriggered) on‐site visits, we found some evidence that central statistical monitoring can identify sites in need of support by an on‐site monitoring intervention. In the third comparison, the evaluation of adding an on‐site visit to local and central monitoring revealed a high percentage of participants with major or critical monitoring findings in the on‐site visit group, but low numbers of absolute monitoring findings in both groups. This means that without on‐site visits, some monitoring findings will be missed, but none of the missed findings had any serious impact on patient safety or the validity of the trial's results. In the fourth comparison, two studies assessed new source data verification processes, which are used to check that data recorded within the trial Case Report Form (CRF) match the primary source data (e.g. medical records), and reported little difference to full source data verification processes for the targeted as well as for the remote approach. In the fifth comparison, one study showed no difference in participant recruitment and participant follow‐up between a monitoring approach with systematic initiation visits versus an approach with initiation visits upon request by study sites. 
Certainty of evidence 
We are moderately certain that risk‐based monitoring is not inferior to extensive on‐site monitoring with respect to critical and major monitoring findings in clinical trials. For the remaining body of evidence, there is low or very low certainty in results due to imprecision, small number of studies, or high risk of bias. Ideally, for each of the five identified comparisons, more high‐quality monitoring studies that measure effects on all outcomes specified in this review are necessary to draw more reliable conclusions.

Despite being preventable, malaria remains an important public health problem. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that overall progress in malaria control has plateaued for the first time since the turn of the century. Researchers and policymakers are therefore exploring alternative and supplementary malaria vector control tools. Research in 1900 indicated that modification of houses may be effective in reducing malaria: this is now being revisited, with new research now examining blocking house mosquito entry points or modifying house construction materials to reduce exposure of inhabitants to infectious bites. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of house modifications on malaria disease and transmission.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase (OVID); Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International (CAB) Abstracts (Web of Science); and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database (LILACS), up to 1 November 2019. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en/), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/) to identify ongoing trials up to the same date. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials, including cluster‐randomized controlled trials (cRCTs), cross‐over studies, and stepped‐wedge designs were eligible, as were quasi‐experimental trials, including controlled before‐and‐after studies, controlled interrupted time series, and non‐randomized cross‐over studies. We only considered studies reporting epidemiological outcomes (malaria case incidence, malaria infection incidence or parasite prevalence). We also summarised qualitative studies conducted alongside included studies. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors selected eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We used risk ratios (RR) to compare the effect of the intervention with the control for dichotomous data. For continuous data, we presented the mean difference; and for count and rate data, we used rate ratios. We presented all results with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Six cRCTs met our inclusion criteria, all conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa; three randomized by household, two by village, and one at the community level. All trials assessed screening of windows, doors, eaves, ceilings or any combination of these; this was either alone, or in combination with eave closure, roof modification or eave tube installation (a ""lure and kill"" device that reduces mosquito entry whilst maintaining some airflow). In two trials, the interventions were insecticide‐based. In five trials, the researchers implemented the interventions. The community implemented the interventions in the sixth trial. 
At the time of writing the review, two of the six trials had published results, both of which compared screened houses (without insecticide) to unscreened houses. One trial in Ethiopia assessed screening of windows and doors. Another trial in the Gambia assessed full screening (screening of eaves, doors and windows), as well as screening of ceilings only. 
Screening may reduce clinical malaria incidence caused by Plasmodium falciparum (rate ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.82; 1 trial, 184 participants, 219.3 person‐years; low‐certainty evidence; Ethiopian study). For malaria parasite prevalence, the point estimate, derived from The Gambia study, was smaller (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.17; 713 participants, 1 trial; low‐certainty evidence), and showed an effect on anaemia (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.42, 0.89; 705 participants; 1 trial, moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Screening may reduce the entomological inoculation rate (EIR): both trials showed lower estimates in the intervention arm. In the Gambian trial, there was a mean difference in EIR between the control houses and treatment houses ranging from 0.45 to 1.50 (CIs ranged from ‐0.46 to 2.41; low‐certainty evidence), depending on the study year and treatment arm. The Ethiopian trial reported a mean difference in EIR of 4.57, favouring screening (95% CI 3.81 to 5.33; low‐certainty evidence). 
Pooled analysis of the trials showed that individuals living in fully screened houses were slightly less likely to sleep under a bed net (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.09; 2 trials, 203 participants). In one trial, bed net usage was also lower in individuals living in houses with screened ceilings (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.95; 1 trial, 135 participants). 
Authors' conclusions
Based on the two trials published to date, there is some evidence that screening may reduce malaria transmission and malaria infection in people living in the house. The four trials awaiting publication are likely to enrich the current evidence base, and we will add these to this review when they become available.

Can Changing Houses Help Stop Malaria?

### **Rationale**

Malaria is a serious illness spread by mosquito bites. It is a big health problem in many parts of the world. We have ways to prevent malaria, but our progress has slowed down. We need new ways to help protect people.

A very old idea is to change houses to keep mosquitos out. Over 100 years ago, doctors thought this could work. Now, researchers are looking at this idea again. They want to know if blocking mosquitos from entering homes can stop people from getting sick.

This review looked at studies that tested this idea. The main question was: Can adding screens to windows and doors or making other changes to houses reduce malaria? Researchers hoped to find out if these simple changes could be a new tool in the fight against malaria.

### **Trial Design**

This was not one single study. Instead, researchers did a review. A review gathers the results from many past studies to get a bigger and clearer picture of a topic.

The researchers looked for studies about changing houses to stop malaria. All the studies they found were done in parts of Africa south of the Sahara Desert. The people in these studies were men, women, and children living in these areas.

The researchers looked for specific types of studies where groups of people were compared. For example, one group lived in houses with screens, and the other group lived in houses with no screens. They searched for all studies on this topic up to November 2019.

### **Results**

The researchers found six good studies. At the time of this review, only two of the six studies had shared their results. Both studies looked at what happened when screens were added to houses.

**What did the studies find?**
One study in Ethiopia found that people in houses with screens on windows and doors were less likely to get sick with malaria.

A second study in The Gambia found that people in screened houses had lower rates of anemia. Anemia is a condition where your body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. It can make you feel tired and weak, and it is often caused by malaria.

**Did screening keep mosquitos out?**
Both studies showed that screening houses may lower the number of bites people get from mosquitos that carry malaria. This is a good sign that screening helps protect people.

**What did the researchers conclude?**
Based on these two studies, there is some proof that adding screens to houses can help reduce malaria. It may lower the number of malaria cases and also help prevent anemia.

However, the proof is not very strong yet because we only have results from two studies. Four other studies are still going on. When their results are ready, we will have a much clearer answer. The researchers also noticed that people living in screened houses were slightly less likely to use bed nets. This is important to know for future malaria control plans.","House modifications for preventing malaria
What is the aim of this review? 
House modifications, such as screening (covering potential house entry points for mosquitoes with netting or mesh), or the use of alternative construction materials, may contribute to reducing the burden of malaria. They work by blocking mosquitoes from entering houses, and reducing the number of bites householders receive indoors. Some of the house modifications under consideration additionally aim to kill any mosquitoes that attempt to enter houses by incorporating insecticide into the modification. 
Key messages 
Screening windows, doors, eaves and ceilings to prevent mosquitoes entering the house may reduce malaria transmission and illness in people living in the house, based on evidence from two studies conducted in Africa. Four trials awaiting publication are likely to enrich the current evidence base. 
What was studied in the review? 
This review summarized studies investigating the effects of house modifications on human malaria outcomes. If studies additionally reported the effect of the house modifications on mosquitoes (those with potential to carry malaria), or householders' views, we also summarized this data. After searching for relevant studies, we identified six studies conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa, two of which have published data, and four of which are not yet in the public domain. All trials assessed screening (of windows, doors, eaves, ceilings, or any combination of these), either alone or in combination with eave closure, roof modification, or eave tube installation (a ""lure and kill"" device positioned in eave gaps). 
What are the main results of the review? 
The two trials with published data assessed the effect of screening alone on malaria infection. Both trials showed a reduction in malaria in screened houses, to varying degrees of effect. One trial in Ethiopia showed that people living in screened houses were around 62% less likely to experience an episode of clinical malaria (caused by P falciparum). However, the certainty of this evidence was low due to issues with the study design, and the trial did not study enough people for us to be confident about the results. Another trial in The Gambia showed that people living in screened houses were around 16% less likely to have P falciparum malaria parasites in their blood, and were less likely to experience anaemia. Our confidence in this result was low because the trial did not study enough people. 
How up to date is this review? 
The review authors searched for studies available up to 1 November 2019.

Background 
Dementia due to Alzheimer’s and other diseases is a leading cause of disability and an enormous health and societal problem.

Main findings 
We analysed data from 33 studies of CT that included a total of approximately 2000 participants and were conducted in 12 countries. We found that, compared with receiving usual treatment or engaging in non‐specific activities, people completing CT may show some benefits in overall cognition, as well as in more specific cognitive abilities such as verbal fluency, and that improvements may last for at least a few months.

Can Brain Training Help People with Dementia?

### **Rationale**

Dementia is a health problem that affects a person’s ability to think, remember, and reason. It can be caused by diseases like Alzheimer’s. Dementia can make it very hard for people to do daily tasks. It is a major cause of disability in the world.

Many people live with dementia today. That number is expected to grow a lot in the future. Because of this, we urgently need to find good treatments. These treatments could help ease the problems dementia causes for people and their families.

One type of treatment does not use medicine. It is called cognitive training. You can think of it like exercise for your brain. This training uses guided practice on special tasks. These tasks are designed to help with memory, focus, or solving problems.

Researchers are not sure if this brain training can really help people who have mild to moderate dementia. This study was done to see if brain training helps people think better or improves their daily life.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of many past studies. They combined the information from all of them to get a clearer picture. This helps us see what most of the science says.

The researchers looked at 33 different studies. These studies took place in 12 different countries. In total, about 2000 people with mild to moderate dementia were part of these studies.

In the studies, one group of people did the brain training. Another group either got their usual care or did other general activities. The researchers then compared the results of the different groups to see if the brain training made a difference. The studies checked for benefits that lasted for at least a few months after the training ended.

### **Results**

The researchers found that brain training may offer some small benefits. People who finished the brain training had slightly better results on tests of their overall thinking skills. They were also a little better at tasks like finding the right words when they talk. These small improvements seemed to last for at least a few months.

The good news is that the brain training did not seem to cause any harm or add stress for the people who did it.

However, the brain training was not proven to be better than other active treatments. This means that doing other engaging activities might provide similar benefits. Brain training was helpful when compared to doing nothing or just getting usual care.

The researchers pointed out that the studies they reviewed were not of the highest quality. This means we need to be careful with the results. They believe we need more and better studies in the future. These new studies should also follow people for a longer time. This will help us learn if the benefits of brain training can last for more than just a few months.","Cognitive training for people with mild to moderate dementia

Bottom line 
The available evidence suggests that a course of acupuncture consisting of at least six treatment sessions can be a valuable option for people with migraine. 
Background 
Individuals with migraine have repeated attacks of severe headache, usually just on one side and often with vomiting. Acupuncture is a therapy in which thin needles are inserted into the skin at particular points. It originated in China, and is now used in many countries to treat people with migraine. We evaluated whether acupuncture reduces the number of episodes of migraine. We looked at the number of people in whom the number of migraine days per month was reduced by half or more than half. 
Key results 
For this update, we reviewed 22 trials with 4985 people, published up to January 2016. We omitted five trials from the original review because they included people who had had migraine for less than 12 months. We included five new trials in this update. 
In four trials, acupuncture added to usual care or treatment of migraine on onset only (usually with pain‐killers) resulted in 41 in 100 people having the frequency of headaches at least halved, compared to 17 of 100 people given usual care only. 
In 15 trials, acupuncture was compared with 'fake' acupuncture, where needles are inserted at incorrect points or do not penetrate the skin. The frequency of headaches halved in 50 of 100 people receiving true acupuncture, compared with 41 of 100 people receiving 'fake' acupuncture. The results were dominated by three good quality large trials (with about 1200 people) showing that the effect of true acupuncture was still present after six months. There were no differences in the number of side effects of real and 'fake' acupuncture, or the numbers dropping out because of side effects. 
In five trials, acupuncture was compared to a drug proven to reduce the frequency of migraine attacks, but only three trials provided useful information. At three months, headache frequency halved in 57 of 100 people receiving acupuncture, compared with 46 of 100 people taking the drug. After six months, headache frequency halved in 59 of 100 people receiving acupuncture, compared with 54 of 100 people taking the drug. People receiving acupuncture reported side effects less often than people receiving drugs, and were less likely to drop out of the trial. 
Our findings about the number of days with migraine per month can be summarized as follows. If people have six days with migraine per month on average before starting treatment, this would be reduced to five days in people receiving only usual care, to four days in those receiving fake acupuncture or a prophylactic drug, and to three and a half days in those receiving true acupuncture.

Can Acupuncture Help Stop Migraine Headaches?

**Rationale**

A migraine is a type of very bad headache. People with migraines have these headaches over and over. The pain is often on one side of the head. It can also make people feel sick and throw up. Migraines can make it hard to live a normal life.

This summary is about a review of many studies. Researchers wanted to find out if a treatment called acupuncture could help people with migraines. Acupuncture is a treatment where a trained person puts very thin needles into the skin at certain spots on the body.

The main goal was to see if getting acupuncture could mean having fewer migraine headaches. Researchers also wanted to know if it worked better than other treatments. This information can help people with migraines choose the best way to feel better.

**Trial Design**

This was not one single study. Instead, researchers looked at the results from 22 different studies. In total, these studies included almost 5,000 people who had migraines for a year or more.

The studies compared real acupuncture to three different things:

*   **Usual care:** This was the care people normally get for a migraine, like taking pain pills when a headache starts.
*   **Fake acupuncture:** This is when needles are used but are put in the wrong spots. Sometimes the needles do not even go into the skin. This helps researchers see if real acupuncture works better.
*   **A medicine to prevent migraines:** This was a drug that is known to help lower the number of migraine attacks.

In the studies, researchers counted how many people had their number of migraine days cut in half. They checked these results for up to six months.

**Results**

The studies showed that acupuncture helped people have fewer migraines.

When compared to usual care, more people who got acupuncture had their headache days cut in half. For every 100 people, 41 who had acupuncture felt this much better. Only 17 of 100 people who had usual care felt this much better.

When compared to fake acupuncture, real acupuncture still worked better. For every 100 people, 50 who got real acupuncture had their headache days cut in half. In the fake acupuncture group, 41 out of 100 people had the same result. This shows that real acupuncture was a bit better than fake acupuncture. The good effects of real acupuncture were still there after six months.

When compared to a medicine that prevents migraines, acupuncture also worked well. After three months, 57 out of 100 people in the acupuncture group had half as many headaches. This was true for 46 out of 100 people who took the medicine. People who had acupuncture also had fewer side effects than people who took the medicine.

To put it simply, if a person usually has six migraine days each month:
*   Usual care might lower this to five days.
*   Fake acupuncture or a preventive drug might lower this to four days.
*   Real acupuncture might lower this to about three and a half days.

Based on all the information, the researchers concluded that acupuncture can be a good choice for people with migraines. They suggest that a person should have at least six acupuncture sessions to see if it helps.","Acupuncture for preventing migraine attacks

10.1002-14651858.CD013381.pub2,"Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic lung condition characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms and limited lung airflow, dyspnoea and recurrent exacerbations. Suboptimal therapy or non‐adherence may result in limited effectiveness of pharmacological treatments and subsequently poor health outcomes. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy and safety of interventions intended to improve adherence to single or combined pharmacological treatments compared with usual care or interventions that are not intended to improve adherence in people with COPD. 
Search methods
We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase (search date 1 May 2020). We also searched web‐based clinical trial registers. 
Selection criteria
RCTs included adults with COPD diagnosed by established criteria (e.g. Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease). Interventions included change to pharmacological treatment regimens, adherence aids, education, behavioural or psychological interventions (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy), communication or follow‐up by a health professional (e.g. telephone, text message or face‐to‐face), multi‐component interventions, and interventions to improve inhaler technique. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Working in pairs, four review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We assessed confidence in the evidence for each primary outcome using GRADE. Primary outcomes were adherence, quality of life and hospital service utilisation. Adherence measures included the Adherence among Patients with Chronic Disease questionnaire (APCD). Quality of life measures included the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ). 
Main results
We included 14 trials (2191 participants) in the analysis with follow‐up ranging from six to 52 weeks. Age ranged from 54 to 75 years, and COPD severity ranged from mild to very severe. Trials were conducted in the USA, Spain, Germany, Japan, Jordan, Northern Ireland, Iran, South Korea, China and Belgium. Risk of bias was high due to lack of blinding. Evidence certainty was downgraded due to imprecision and small participant numbers. 
Single component interventions 
Six studies (55 to 212 participants) reported single component interventions including changes to pharmacological treatment (different roflumilast doses or different inhaler types), adherence aids (Bluetooth inhaler reminder device), educational (comprehensive verbal instruction), behavioural or psychological (motivational interview). 
Change in dose of roflumilast may result in little to no difference in adherence (odds ratio (OR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 1.99; studies = 1, participants = 55; low certainty). A Bluetooth inhaler reminder device did not improve adherence, but comprehensive verbal instruction from a health professional did improve mean adherence (prescription refills) (mean difference (MD) 1.00, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.54). Motivational interview improved mean adherence scores on the APCD scale (MD 22.22, 95% CI 8.42 to 36.02). 
Use of a single inhaler compared to two separate inhalers may have little to no impact on quality of life (SGRQ; MD 0.80, 95% CI –3.12 to 4.72; very low certainty). A Bluetooth inhaler monitoring device may provide a small improvement in quality of life on the CCQ (MD 0.40, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.73; very low certainty). 
Single inhaler use may have little to no impact on the number of people admitted to hospital compared to two separate inhalers (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.90; very low certainty). Single component interventions may have little to no impact on the number of people expereincing adverse events (very low certainty evidence from studies of a change in pharmacotherapy or use of adherence aids). A change in pharmacotherapy may have little to no impact on exacerbations or deaths (very low certainty). 
Multi‐component interventions 
Eight studies (30 to 734 participants) reported multi‐component interventions including tailored care package that included adherence support as a key component or included inhaler technique as a component. 
A multi‐component intervention may result in more people adhering to pharmacotherapy compared to control at 40.5 weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.37, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.59; studies = 4, participants = 446; I2 = 0%; low certainty). 
There may be little to no impact on quality of life (SGRQ, Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire, CAT) (studies = 3; low to very low certainty). 
Multi‐component interventions may help to reduce the number of people admitted to hospital for any cause (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.63; studies = 2, participants = 877; low certainty), or COPD‐related hospitalisations (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.34; studies = 2, participants = 220; moderate certainty). There may be a small benefit on people experiencing severe exacerbations. 
There may be little to no effect on adverse events, serious adverse events or deaths, but events were infrequently reported and were rare (low to very low certainty). 
Authors' conclusions
Single component interventions (e.g. education or motivational interviewing provided by a health professional) can help to improve adherence to pharmacotherapy (low to very low certainty). There were slight improvements in quality of life with a Bluetooth inhaler device, but evidence is from one study and very low certainty. Change to pharmacotherapy (e.g. single inhaler instead of two, or different doses of roflumilast) has little impact on hospitalisations or exacerbations (very low certainty). There is no difference in people experiencing adverse events (all‐cause or COPD‐related), or deaths (very low certainty). 
Multi‐component interventions may improve adherence with education, motivational or behavioural components delivered by health professionals (low certainty). There is little to no impact on quality of life (low to very low certainty). They may help reduce the number of people admitted to hospital overall (specifically pharmacist‐led approaches) (low certainty), and fewer people may have COPD‐related hospital admissions (moderately certainty). There may be a small reduction in people experiencing severe exacerbations, but evidence is from one study (low certainty). Limited evidence found no difference in people experiencing adverse events, serious adverse events or deaths (low to very low certainty). 
The evidence presented should be interpreted with caution. Larger studies with more intervention types, especially single interventions, are needed. It is unclear which specific COPD subgroups would benefit, therefore discussions between health professionals and patients may help to determine whether they will help to improve health outcomes.

Helping People with COPD Take Their Medicine Better

### **Rationale**

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, is a long-term lung disease. It can make it hard to breathe. People with COPD can feel short of breath. Their symptoms can also get worse suddenly. This is called a flare-up.

Doctors give people medicine to help them breathe better. This medicine often comes in an inhaler that you breathe in. The medicine only works if you take it correctly and on time.

Sometimes people forget to take their medicine. Or they may not use their inhaler the right way. When this happens, the medicine does not work as well. This can lead to more flare-ups and other health problems.

This study looked at different ways to help people with COPD take their medicine as prescribed. Researchers wanted to know which ways work best and if they are safe.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of 14 past studies. In total, 2191 adults with COPD were in these studies. The people in the studies were between 54 and 75 years old.

In each study, people were split into groups by chance. One group got a new type of help to take their medicine. The other group got the usual care from their doctor. The researchers then compared the results from the different groups. The studies lasted for different amounts of time, from 6 weeks up to one year.

### **Results**

The researchers looked at two types of help. One type used only one method to help. The other type used a mix of different methods together.

**Help from a Single Method**
When only one method was used, this is what researchers found:

*   **Talking with a health worker helped.** Getting good instructions or special coaching helped people take their medicine more often.
*   **A Bluetooth reminder on an inhaler did not help much.** It did not help people take their medicine more often. But it may have helped them feel a little better day-to-day.
*   **Changing the medicine plan did not seem to make a big difference.** This included using one inhaler instead of two.

**Help from a Mix of Methods**
When a mix of methods was used together, this is what researchers found:

*   **Using a mix of methods helped people take their medicine more often.** This mix could include education, special coaching, and other support.
*   **This mix of methods also helped keep people out of the hospital.** Fewer people who got this extra help needed to go to the hospital for any reason. Even fewer needed to go to the hospital because of their COPD.

**What the Researchers Concluded**
The researchers found that some methods can help people with COPD. Talking with a health worker is a good way to help people take their medicine. Using a mix of support methods can also help. This mix may also keep people out of the hospital.

For both types of help, there was no change in bad side effects from the medicine.

The researchers said we need bigger studies to be sure about these results. They believe patients and doctors should talk together. This can help them decide on the best plan to help each person manage their COPD medicine.","Which approaches help people with COPD to maintain taking medication as prescribed?
Review question 
Which approaches help people maintain taking prescribed medication(s), improve quality of life and reduce hospital admissions in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)? 
Background 
COPD is a lung condition that can cause long‐term breathing problems and includes symptoms such as shortness of breath. Medications do exist that can help but sometimes people do not take them as prescribed. Different approaches could help people to take their medication as prescribed and help improve symptoms or quality of life and reduce hospital admissions. 
We wanted to find out if any approaches could help people with COPD take their medication(s) as prescribed. 
Studies identified and selected 
We searched databases to find the studies. Four people working in pairs looked at the lists of studies separately and agreed on which ones were included. The latest search for studies was conducted in May 2020. 
Study characteristics 
We included studies comparing simple ways to help improve medication use (e.g. different medication doses or single inhalers instead of two separate inhalers) to usual COPD care. We also included studies that tested combination approaches (e.g. information or training from nurses or pharmacists and monitoring medication use). 
What were the key results? 
We included 14 studies (2191 people) in our analysis. No studies were masked (people knew whether they were receiving an approach to help them with adherence or the alternative). Six studies used simple approaches (e.g. change to medication dosage, change to type of inhaler, or a Bluetooth inhaler reminder device), and eight studies used combined approaches (e.g. nurses or pharmacists giving advice or information about how to improve medication use). 
We were uncertain about the effects of a different medication dose on people adhering to medication because it was no different to usual care (one study). Two separate studies found that a Bluetooth inhaler reminder device or a change in oral medication dose did not help to improve adherence. Health professionals involved in giving information may help to improve adherence (one study). This was measured by prescription refills. Motivating people to change their behaviour could help to improve adherence their medication (one study). This was measured by people completing a questionnaire about adherence to their medication. 
One study found that a Bluetooth inhaler device might help to improve quality of life. There may be little to no difference between those using single inhalers in the number of people admitted to hospital compared to those using two separate inhalers (one study). We found no difference between single approaches and usual care on the number of people who had side effects. 
Combined approaches may help to improve the number of people taking their medication, but we were not confident of this finding (four studies). They may have little to no impact on quality of life (three studies). Combined approaches could be beneficial in reducing the number of people with COPD admitted to hospital for any reason or because of COPD symptoms (two studies). 
There was no difference between combined approaches and in the number of people who had adverse events. 
Take home message 
We could not say for certain that simple approaches are useful to help people with COPD to improve medication use because of very limited information. Combined approaches may help people to take their medication(s) as prescribed and can help to reduce the number of people admitted to hospital, however, more information is needed to help answer this question with confidence.

Review question 
We examined the effect of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen, for people with acute low back pain. Acute low back pain is defined as the presence of pain in the back, below the ribs and above the buttocks, for under 12 weeks. We compared NSAIDs to placebo, paracetamol, other NSAIDs, other drugs, and non‐drug treatments. 
Background 
Acute low back pain is common, and causes pain and disability. Physicians often prescribe NSAIDs to treat acute low back pain. Different types of NSAIDs are available, both over‐the‐counter and as prescription drugs. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials that were published or registered before 7 January 2020. We included 32 trials with 5356 participants. Trial participants were 16 to 78 years old and had acute low back pain. Study length varied from one day to six months. The studies took place in many different countries. More than half of the studies was done in Europe and North‐America. 
Key results 
NSAIDs were slightly more effective than placebo for pain reduction in the first three weeks. On average, the pain intensity decreased by 7.3 points on a 100‐point scale. This means there was a small difference between the two treatments, but it was not clinically relevant. People receiving NSAIDs also scored 2.0 points better on a 24‐point disability scale than those receiving placebo. This is unlikely to be of real‐world benefit. There was a similar number of side effects between people receiving NSAIDs and people receiving placebo. However, the type of studies that we investigated are not designed to find side effects. Therefore, we should be careful about drawing conclusions based upon these findings. 
We also compared two different types of NSAIDs; non‐selective NSAIDs versus COX‐2 inhibitors. We found no clear differences in effect. There was also a similar number of reported side effects of the digestive system, such as abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, or stomach symptoms. 
Quality of the evidence 
There is moderate quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective than placebo for reducing short‐term pain, and high quality evidence that they are slightly more effective than placebo for reducing disability in acute low back pain. The magnitude of the effect is very small.

Do Common Pain Pills Help with New Low Back Pain?

### **Rationale**

Low back pain is a very common problem. The pain is felt in your lower back, below your ribs. It can make it hard to do your daily tasks. When this pain is new and has lasted for less than three months, it is called acute low back pain.

Doctors often suggest anti-inflammatory pain pills to help with this pain. You may know these pills by names like ibuprofen or naproxen. These drugs are meant to fight swelling and ease pain.

We wanted to know if these pain pills really work for new low back pain. We looked at many studies to find a clear answer. This helps both doctors and patients make better choices about treatment.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, we looked at the results of 32 studies that were already finished. Looking at many studies at once gives us a stronger idea of what works.

In total, these studies included more than 5,000 people. The people in the studies were between 16 and 78 years old. They all had new low back pain that had started recently.

The studies we looked at compared the pain pills to a placebo. A placebo is a ""sugar pill"" with no medicine in it. This helps us see if the real medicine is the reason people feel better. The studies lasted for different amounts of time, from one day up to six months.

### **Results**

We found that the pain pills helped a little bit with pain. In the first three weeks, people who took the pain pills had slightly less pain than those who took a sugar pill. But this difference was very small. It was likely not a big enough change for a person to really notice in their daily life.

The pills also helped a little with disability. This means people could move and do things a bit more easily. But like the change in pain, this effect was also very small. It was probably not enough to make a real-world difference for most people.

We also looked at side effects. About the same number of people had side effects whether they took the real pill or the sugar pill. But we must be careful with this finding. The studies were not designed to look for side effects. So, we cannot be sure about the safety of these pills from this review.

Finally, we compared two different types of these anti-inflammatory pain pills. We found no clear difference between them. They seemed to work about the same for pain and caused similar stomach issues. Based on good proof, we learned that while these pills may help a tiny bit, they do not offer a large benefit for people with new low back pain.","Anti‐inflammatory drugs for acute low back pain
Review question 
We examined the effect of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen, for people with acute low back pain. Acute low back pain is defined as the presence of pain in the back, below the ribs and above the buttocks, for under 12 weeks. We compared NSAIDs to placebo, paracetamol, other NSAIDs, other drugs, and non‐drug treatments. 
Background 
Acute low back pain is common, and causes pain and disability. Physicians often prescribe NSAIDs to treat acute low back pain. Different types of NSAIDs are available, both over‐the‐counter and as prescription drugs. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials that were published or registered before 7 January 2020. We included 32 trials with 5356 participants. Trial participants were 16 to 78 years old and had acute low back pain. Study length varied from one day to six months. The studies took place in many different countries. More than half of the studies was done in Europe and North‐America. 
Key results 
NSAIDs were slightly more effective than placebo for pain reduction in the first three weeks. On average, the pain intensity decreased by 7.3 points on a 100‐point scale. This means there was a small difference between the two treatments, but it was not clinically relevant. People receiving NSAIDs also scored 2.0 points better on a 24‐point disability scale than those receiving placebo. This is unlikely to be of real‐world benefit. There was a similar number of side effects between people receiving NSAIDs and people receiving placebo. However, the type of studies that we investigated are not designed to find side effects. Therefore, we should be careful about drawing conclusions based upon these findings. 
We also compared two different types of NSAIDs; non‐selective NSAIDs versus COX‐2 inhibitors. We found no clear differences in effect. There was also a similar number of reported side effects of the digestive system, such as abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, or stomach symptoms. 
Quality of the evidence 
There is moderate quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective than placebo for reducing short‐term pain, and high quality evidence that they are slightly more effective than placebo for reducing disability in acute low back pain. The magnitude of the effect is very small.

Review question 
What is the effectiveness of compression stockings as the only and initial treatment of varicose veins in people without healed or active venous ulceration (leg ulcers)? 
Background 
Varicose veins are widened veins that twist and turn and are visible under the skin of the legs. They generally do not cause medical problems, although many people seek medical advice. Symptoms may include pain, ankle swelling, tired legs, restless legs, night cramps, heaviness, itching and distress from their cosmetic appearance. Complications such as oedema (build‐up of fluid), pigmentation, inflammation (swelling, redness and pain) and ulceration (sores) can also develop. Compression stockings are often the first line of treatment and come in a variety of lengths from knee‐length to full tights, and apply different pressures to support the flow of blood in the veins. 
Study characteristics 
We included 13 studies involving 1021 participants with varicose veins who had not experienced venous ulceration in this review (search run May 2020). Five studies assessed compression stocking versus no compression stocking (for example no treatment or placebo stocking with no graduated elastic). Three of these studies used knee‐length stockings, one used full‐length stockings and one used full tights. Eight studies compared different types or pressures of knee‐length stockings. The stockings used in the studies exerted different levels of pressure. One study included only pregnant women, while other studies included people who had sought medical intervention for their varicose veins by being on surgical waiting lists, or attending vascular surgery or dermatology (skin care) clinics or outpatient departments. 
Key results 
Participants considered their symptoms had improved when stockings were worn in the nine studies that assessed this outcome, but these assessments were not always made by comparing one treatment group of the trial with a control group in the same study and was therefore subject to bias. 
Two studies comparing stockings with placebo stockings measured physical signs; there was no clear difference between baseline and follow‐up for ankle circumference, while oedema was reduced in the stocking group compared with the placebo stocking group. Generally there were no clear differences between studies comparing two types of stockings for volume reduction and change in diameter (ways to measure oedema). 
Complications or side effects ranged from sweating, itching, irritation, skin dryness and a feeling of tightness. There were no severe or long‐lasting side effects. 
Two studies comparing stockings with different stockings, and four studies comparing stockings with placebo/no treatment assessed compliance (whether the person used the stockings as directed). In the stocking versus different stocking studies, there was no clear difference between the stockings, with generally low levels of compliance reported. In the stocking versus placebo/no treatment group, three studies reported results. Of these, one study reported a high initial dropout rate with generally low levels of compliance. The other two studies reported generally good compliance in the stocking group. Some reasons provided for non‐compliance included discomfort, difficulty in putting the stockings on, appearance, not being effective and causing irritation. 
Four studies that compared stockings with different stockings and two studies that compared stockings with placebo/no treatment assessed comfort, tolerance and acceptability of stockings. Comparing stockings with placebo/no treatment, comfort, tolerance and acceptability was affected by the study population. Compression tights were increasingly rejected by pregnant women as their pregnancy progressed, while in a study of non‐pregnant women, the stockings group showed no more hindrance of normal activities and daytime discomfort when compared with placebo stockings. In the stocking versus different stockings studies, two studies reported similar levels of tolerance and discomfort between the types of stocking. Discomfort was the main reason for indicating a preference for one type of stocking over another. 
One study assessed quality of life, showing no clear differences between the stocking and no stocking groups. 
No conclusions regarding the optimum length or pressure of compression stockings could be made as there were no conclusive results from the included studies.  
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence was low or very low because of risk of bias due to poor reporting, not all studies assessed the same outcomes, they assessed them in different ways, or reported them in a way that they could be combined and analysed with other studies. Evidence from available trials is not sufficient to determine if compression stockings as the only and initial treatment are effective in managing and treating varicose veins in the early stages.

A Review of Studies: Do Tight Socks Help with Varicose Veins?

### **Rationale**

**What are varicose veins?**

Varicose veins are veins that have become large and twisted. You can often see them under the skin on your legs. They can look blue or purple and may appear lumpy. For most people, these veins are not a serious health problem.

**How do varicose veins affect people?**

Varicose veins can cause discomfort. Your legs might feel heavy, tired, or achy. Some people get swollen ankles or cramps in their legs, especially at night. The skin over the veins might also feel itchy. Many people do not like how their varicose veins look. In some cases, varicose veins can lead to other problems. These can include skin color changes, swelling, or even open sores on the legs called ulcers.

**Why was this study done?**

Doctors often suggest wearing special tight socks to help with varicose veins. These are called compression stockings. They gently squeeze your legs to help blood flow better in your veins. Researchers wanted to find out if these socks really work as a first treatment for people with varicose veins. They looked at past studies to get a clearer answer. They wanted to know if these socks help with symptoms and stop the veins from getting worse.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this review designed?**

The researchers did not do a new study with patients. Instead, they looked for all the past studies on this topic. They found 13 studies that met their goals and brought all the information together. This type of research is called a review. It helps to give a bigger picture of what we know.

**Who was in the studies?**

In total, the 13 studies included just over 1000 people. All of these people had varicose veins. They did not have any open sores on their legs. One study was just for pregnant women. Other studies included men and women who were waiting for surgery or were visiting a special doctor for their veins or skin.

**What did the studies compare?**

The studies were set up in different ways. Some of the studies compared people wearing the special socks to people not wearing them. In these studies, one group wore the socks. The other group wore no socks or fake socks that did not squeeze the leg. Other studies compared different kinds of special socks. For example, they compared socks that came up to the knee with socks that went all the way up the leg. They also compared socks with different amounts of squeeze.

### **Results**

**What did the studies find about symptoms?**

Many people in the studies said their legs felt better when they wore the socks. But the researchers who did this review were not sure about this finding. The way the studies measured this was not always reliable. This makes it hard to be sure if the socks really helped the symptoms.

**Did the socks reduce swelling?**

One study found that the socks did help reduce leg swelling caused by extra fluid. This was compared to people who wore fake socks with no squeeze. However, there was no clear change in the size of people's ankles. When studies compared two different types of socks, there was no clear winner for reducing swelling.

**Were there any side effects?**

Some people had minor problems with the socks. These included sweating, itching, or dry skin. Some people also felt the socks were too tight and uncomfortable. But there were no serious or long-lasting side effects reported in any of the studies.

**Did people wear the socks as they were told?**

In many studies, people did not wear the socks as often as their doctor told them to. Some reasons for this were that the socks were uncomfortable or hard to put on. Some people did not like how they looked. Others felt the socks were not working. In two other studies, however, people did wear the socks well.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

The team that wrote this review looked at all the information. They said that the proof from the 13 studies was of low quality. This was because the studies were small or were not described very well. Because of this, we still do not have a clear answer. We cannot be sure if wearing compression socks is a good first treatment for varicose veins. We also do not know which length or tightness of sock is best.","Wearing stockings to provide compression for the treatment of varicose veins

10.1002-14651858.CD010789.pub2,"Whole‐body cryotherapy for preventing and treating muscle soreness after exercise
Background and aim of the review 
Delayed onset muscle soreness describes the muscular pain, tenderness and stiffness experienced after high‐intensity or unaccustomed exercise. Various therapies are in use to prevent or reduce muscle soreness after exercise and to enhance recovery. One more recent therapy that is growing in use is whole‐body cryotherapy (WBC). This involves single or repeated exposure(s) to extremely cold dry air (below ‐100°C) in a specialised chamber or cabin for two to four minutes per exposure. This review aimed to find out whether WBC reduced muscle soreness, improved recovery and was safe for those people for whom it can be used. 
Results of the search 
We searched medical databases up to August 2015 for studies that compared WBC with a control intervention such as passive rest or no treatment; or with another active intervention such as cold water immersion. We found four small studies. These reported results for a total of 64 physically active young adults. All but four participants were male. The studies were very varied such as the type, temperature, duration and frequency of the WBC and the exercises used to induce muscle soreness. There were two comparisons: WBC compared with a control intervention; and WBC compared with far‐infrared therapy. 
Key results 
All four studies compared WBC with either passive rest or no treatment. These provided some evidence that WBC may reduce muscle soreness (pain at rest) at 1, 24, 48 and 72 hours after exercise. However, the evidence also included the possibility that WBC may not make a difference or may make the pain worse. There was some weak evidence that WBC may improve well‐being at 24 hours. There was no report and probably no monitoring of adverse events in these four studies. 
One very small study also compared WBC with far‐infrared therapy and reported lower levels of muscle soreness one hour after the treatment. 
Quality of the evidence 
All four studies had aspects that could undermine the reliability of their results. We decided that the evidence was of very low quality for all outcomes. Thus, the findings remain very uncertain and further research may provide evidence that could change our conclusions. 
Conclusions 
The currently available evidence is insufficient to support the use of WBC for preventing and treating muscle soreness after exercise in adults. Furthermore, the best prescription of WBC and its safety are not known.

Does Standing in a Very Cold Room Help Sore Muscles After Exercise?

**Rationale**

Have you ever felt stiff and sore a day or two after a hard workout? This is called delayed onset muscle soreness. This muscle pain can make it hard to move and can stop you from doing your daily tasks. People often look for ways to feel better and help their muscles recover faster.

One treatment that is becoming more popular is called whole-body cryotherapy. This means ""cold therapy for the whole body."" To do this, a person stands in a special, very cold room for a few minutes. The air in the room is extremely cold and dry.

Researchers wanted to find out if this cold therapy really works. They looked at past studies to see if it helps reduce muscle soreness after exercise. They also wanted to know if this treatment is safe for people to use. This review was needed because we do not have a lot of clear information on this topic.

**Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new people. Instead, researchers looked for studies that had already been done. They searched for studies that compared the cold therapy to resting or doing nothing. They also looked for studies that compared it to other treatments.

The researchers found four small studies to look at. In total, these four studies included 64 people. The people in the studies were young, active adults. Almost all of them, 60 out of 64, were men.

Each study was a little different. They used different temperatures for the cold therapy. People also stayed in the cold room for different amounts of time, usually between two and four minutes. The exercises people did to make their muscles sore were also different in each study.

**Results**

The researchers looked at the results from the four studies. All four studies compared the cold therapy to just resting. The results showed that cold therapy might help reduce muscle pain. This was seen at different times after exercise, including one hour, one day, two days, and three days later.

However, the proof for this was not very strong. The results also showed that it is possible the cold therapy does not help at all. It could even make the pain worse. There was also a small sign that people might feel better one day after the cold therapy. The studies did not say if there were any bad side effects or problems from the treatment. It seems they did not check to see if the treatment was safe.

The researchers found that all four studies had problems in how they were done. This means we cannot be very sure about their results. Because of this, the researchers said the proof was of ""very low quality."" This means we cannot trust the results until we have better studies.

The final conclusion is that we do not have enough proof to say that this cold therapy works. More and better studies are needed to find the real answer. For now, there is not enough information to tell people to use whole-body cryotherapy for sore muscles. We also do not know the best way to use it or if it is safe.","Whole‐body cryotherapy for preventing and treating muscle soreness after exercise

Disease recurrence and progression remain major challenges in the treatment of non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Blue light‐enhanced transurethral resection of bladder cancer (TURBT) is an approach to improve staging and achieve a complete resection of NMIBC. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of blue light‐enhanced TURBT compared to white light‐based TURBT in the treatment of NMIBC. 
Search methods
We searched several medical literature databases, including the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Embase, as well as trial registers, including ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We performed a comprehensive search with no restrictions on language of publication or publication status until March 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials using blue light versus white light TURBT. Included participants had a high level of suspicion based on imaging or ‘visible diagnosis’ for primary urothelial carcinoma of the bladder or recurrent urothelial carcinoma of the bladder upon cytoscopy. We excluded studies in which blue light was used in a surveillance setting.  
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Our primary outcomes were time to disease recurrence, time to disease progression, and serious surgical complications. Secondary outcomes were time to death from bladder cancer, any adverse events, and non‐serious complications. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included 16 randomized controlled trials involving a total of 4325 participants in the review. The studies compared blue light versus white light TURBT for treatment of NMIBC.  
Primary outcomes 
Blue light TURBT may reduce the risk of disease recurrence over time (hazard ratio (HR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.81; low‐certainty evidence) depending on baseline risk. For participants with low‐, intermediate‐, and high‐risk NMIBC, this corresponded to 48 (66 fewer to 27 fewer), 109 (152 fewer to 59 fewer), and 147 (211 fewer to 76 fewer) fewer recurrences per 1000 participants when compared to white light TURBT, respectively.  
Blue light TURBT may also reduce the risk of disease progression over time (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.84; low‐certainty evidence) depending on baseline risk. For participants with low‐, intermediate‐, and high‐risk NMIBC, this corresponded to 1 (1 fewer to 0 fewer), 17 (25 fewer to 8 fewer), and 56 (81 fewer to 25 fewer) fewer progressions per 1000 participants when compared to white light TURBT, respectively. 
Blue light TURBT may have little or no effect on serious surgical complications (risk ratio (RR) 0.54, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.14; low‐certainty evidence). This corresponded to 10 fewer (19 fewer to 25 more) surgical complications per 1000 participants with blue light TURBT.  
Secondary outcomes 
Blue light TURBT may have little or no effect on the risk of death from bladder cancer over time (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.61; low‐certainty evidence). This corresponded to 22 deaths per 1000 participants with white light TURBT and 10 fewer (17 fewer to 13 more) deaths per 1000 participants with blue light TURBT.   
We are very uncertain how blue light TURBT affects the outcome adverse events of any grade (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.33; low‐certainty evidence).  
No analysis was possible for the outcome non‐serious surgical complications, as it was not reported by any of the included studies. 
Authors' conclusions
Blue light‐enhanced TURBT for the treatment of non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer compared to white light‐based TURBT may reduce the risk of disease recurrence and disease progression over time depending on baseline risk. There may be little or no effect on serious surgical complications. The certainty of evidence for our findings was low, meaning that future studies are likely change to the reported estimates of effect. Frequent issues that led to downgrading of the certainty of the evidence were study limitations, inconsistency, and imprecision.

### **Plain Title**

Using Blue Light to Help Treat Early-Stage Bladder Cancer

### **Rationale**

**What is bladder cancer?**
The bladder is the part of your body that holds pee. Bladder cancer is a disease where cells in the bladder grow out of control. This summary is about a type of cancer called non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. This means the cancer is on the inner lining of the bladder. It has not grown deep into the bladder muscle.

**What is the problem with this type of cancer?**
Doctors treat this cancer with surgery to remove the tumors. But a big problem is that the cancer often comes back after treatment. Sometimes, the cancer can also get worse and grow deeper into the bladder wall. This can be very hard for patients and may require more treatment.

**Why was this study done?**
Doctors usually use a normal white light to see inside the bladder during surgery. This helps them find and remove the cancer. Researchers wanted to know if a special blue light could work better. They thought that blue light might help doctors see the cancer tumors more clearly. If doctors can see the cancer better, they might be able to remove all of it. This could lower the chance of the cancer coming back.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**
This was not a new study with its own patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of many other studies that were already finished. They found 16 studies that compared the two types of light for bladder cancer surgery. They combined the results from all these studies to get a stronger answer. This type of study is called a review.

**Who was in these studies?**
The 16 studies included a total of over 4,300 adults. All of them had non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. For some people, it was their first time having cancer. For others, their cancer had come back after being treated before.

**What did the studies compare?**
In each study, patients were put into one of two groups by chance.
*   One group had surgery using the standard white light.
*   The other group had surgery using the special blue light.

Doctors in each study then watched the patients over time. They checked to see if their cancer came back or got worse. They also looked at any side effects from the surgery.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**
Researchers found that using blue light during surgery may help patients.

*   **Cancer coming back:** The blue light surgery may lower the chance that the cancer comes back. For every 1,000 people who had surgery, using blue light might stop the cancer from coming back in about 48 to 147 people, compared to using white light. The benefit depended on how serious the cancer was to begin with.

*   **Cancer getting worse:** The blue light surgery may also lower the chance that the cancer gets worse. For every 1,000 people, using blue light might stop the cancer from getting worse in about 1 to 56 people.

*   **Safety and side effects:** Researchers also looked at serious problems that can happen from surgery. They found there was likely no difference in serious problems between the two groups. This suggests that the blue light surgery is about as safe as the standard white light surgery.

**What do these results mean?**
The researchers who did this review have a message of caution. They said the quality of the proof was ""low."" This means we cannot be very sure about these results. It is possible that future studies could find different results. More research is needed to be certain that blue light is better than white light.

**What did the researchers conclude?**
The researchers concluded that using blue light for bladder cancer surgery may be helpful. It may reduce the risk of the cancer coming back or getting worse. However, because the proof is not very strong, we need more studies to know for sure.","Blue light‐enhanced versus white light resection in the treatment of non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer 
Review question 
How does a resection (surgical removal) of bladder cancer supported with a special visualization method (blue light) compare to a standard resection with white light in people in whom a tumor of the inner bladder wall is suspected? 
Background 
In people suspected of having bladder cancer, suspicious tissue is cut from the inner bladder wall using a special instrument inserted through the urethra into the bladder. However, it is sometimes difficult to tell what is normal bladder versus what is cancer. In order to see the tumor better and remove it completely, a substance, or 'contrast agent,' is put into the bladder through a catheter. During surgery, a special light is used that is meant to make the cancerous area light up blue.  
Study characteristics 
We only included randomized controlled trials (a type of study where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) for inclusion in the review, as this type of clinical study is considered to be of the highest quality producing the most reliable results. We included people who were very likely to have had bladder cancer because if had been seen on an imaging study (like a computed tomography (CT) scan) or when looking into the bladder. We included studies of people with newly suspected tumors and those who had been treated for bladder cancer before and there was concern it had come back.  
Key results 
We included 16 studies addressing our review question. Overall, blue light‐enhanced resection of bladder cancer may reduce the risk of disease recurrence over time compared to white light resection (low‐certainty evidence) and may reduce the risk of disease progression over time (low‐certainty evidence). However, whether this effect is big enough to be meaningful to people with bladder cancer depends on whether they belong to the low, intermediate and high risk group for disease recurrence or progression.   
We also found that blue light may have little or no effect on the occurrence of serious surgical complications (low‐certainty evidence) or the risk of death from bladder cancer over time (low‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain as to whether blue light TURBT reduces the incidence of unwanted side effects, as the certainty of the evidence was assessed as low. We do not know how non‐serious surgical complications are affected as no data were reported for this outcome. 
Quality of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence was low, meaning that future research would likely change our results.

Hip fractures are a major healthcare problem, presenting a huge challenge and burden to patients, healthcare systems and society. The increased proportion of older adults in the world population means that the absolute number of hip fractures is rising rapidly across the globe. The majority of hip fractures are treated surgically. This review evaluates evidence for types of internal fixation implants used in joint‐preserving surgery for intracapsular hip fractures. 
Objectives
To determine the relative effects (benefits and harms) of different implants for the internal fixation of intracapsular hip fractures in older adults.

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing implants used for internal fixation of fragility intracapsular proximal femoral fractures in older adults. Types of implants were smooth pins (these include pins with fold‐out hooks), screws, or fixed angle plates. We excluded studies in which all or most fractures were caused by specific pathologies other than osteoporosis or were the result of a high energy trauma. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. One review author extracted data and assessed risk of bias which was checked by a second review author. We collected data for seven outcomes: activities of daily living (ADL), delirium, functional status, health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), mobility, mortality (reported within four months of surgery as early mortality, and at 12 months since surgery), and unplanned return to theatre for treating a complication resulting directly or indirectly from the primary procedure (such as deep infection or non‐union). We assessed the certainty of the evidence for these outcomes using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 38 studies (32 RCTs, six quasi‐RCTs) with 8585 participants with 8590 intracapsular fractures. The mean ages of participants in the studies ranged from 60 to 84 years; 73% were women, and 38% of fractures were undisplaced. 
We report here the findings of the four main comparisons, which were between different categories of implants. 
We downgraded the certainty of the outcomes for imprecision (when data were available from insufficient numbers of participants or the confidence interval (CI) was wide), study limitations (e.g. high or unclear risks of bias), and inconsistency (when we noted substantial levels of statistical heterogeneity). 
Smooth pins versus fixed angle plate (four studies, 1313 participants) 
We found very low‐certainty evidence of little or no difference between the two implant types in independent mobility with no more than one walking stick (1 study, 112 participants), early mortality (1 study, 383 participants), mortality at 12 months (2 studies, 661 participants), and unplanned return to theatre (3 studies, 736 participants). No studies reported on ADL, delirium, functional status, or HRQoL. 
Screws versus fixed angle plates (11 studies, 2471 participants) 
We found low‐certainty evidence of no clinically important differences between the two implant types in functional status using WOMAC (MD ‐3.18, 95% CI ‐6.35 to ‐0.01; 2 studies, 498 participants; range of scores from 0 to 96, lower values indicate better function), and HRQoL using EQ‐5D (MD 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.06; 2 studies, 521 participants; range ‐0.654 (worst), 0 (dead), 1 (best)). We also found low‐certainty evidence showing little or no difference between the two implant types in mortality at 12 months (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.31; 7 studies, 1690 participants), and unplanned return to theatre (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.26; 11 studies, 2321 participants). We found very low‐certainty evidence of little or no difference between the two implant types in independent mobility (1 study, 70 participants), and early mortality (3 studies, 467 participants). No studies reported on ADL or delirium. 
Screws versus smooth pins (seven studies, 1119 participants) 
We found low‐certainty evidence of no or little difference between the two implant types in mortality at 12 months (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.35; 6 studies, 1005 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We found very low‐certainty evidence of little or no difference between the two implant types in early mortality (3 studies, 584 participants) and unplanned return to theatre (5 studies, 862 participants). No studies reported on ADL, delirium, functional status, HRQoL, or mobility. 
Screws or smooth pins versus fixed angle plates (15 studies, 3784 participants) 
In this comparison, we combined data from the first two comparison groups. We found low‐certainty evidence of no or little difference between the two groups of implants in mortality at 12 months (RR 1.04, 95% CI.083 to 1.31; 7 studies, 1690 participants) and unplanned return to theatre (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.18; 14 studies, 3057 participants). We found very low‐certainty evidence of little or no difference between the two groups of implants in independent mobility (2 studies, 182 participants), and early mortality (4 studies, 850 participants). We found no additional evidence to support the findings for functional status or HRQoL as reported in 'Screws versus fixed angle plates'. No studies reported ADL or delirium. 
Authors' conclusions
There is low‐certainty evidence that there may be little or no difference between screws and fixed angle plates in functional status, HRQoL, mortality at 12 months, or unplanned return to theatre; and between screws and pins in mortality at 12 months. The limited and very low‐certainty evidence for the outcomes for which data were available for the smooth pins versus fixed angle plates comparison, as well as the other outcomes for which data were available for the screws and fixed angle plates, and screws and pins comparisons means we have very little confidence in the estimates of effect for these outcomes. Additional RCTs would increase the certainty of the evidence. We encourage such studies to report outcomes consistent with the core outcome set for hip fracture, including long‐term quality of life indicators such as ADL and mobility.

Which Tool Works Best to Fix a Broken Hip in Older Adults?

**Rationale**

A broken hip is a very serious injury, especially for older adults. It can cause a lot of pain. It can also make it hard to walk and do daily tasks. A broken hip can mean a long stay in the hospital and a difficult recovery.

This study looked at a specific type of broken hip. It is a break in the ""ball"" part of the hip joint. This part fits into your hip socket. Doctors often use surgery to fix this type of break. During surgery, they use special tools to hold the broken bone pieces together so they can heal. These tools can be pins, screws, or special metal plates.

Researchers wanted to find out if one of these tools works better than the others. They wanted to know if one tool helps people recover better or causes fewer problems. This study was needed because more people are getting older. This means more people are at risk for a broken hip. Finding the best way to fix a broken hip can help many people live better lives after their injury.

**Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of many studies that were already done. This is called a review. A review helps us see what all the past research says about a topic.

The researchers found 38 studies to review. These studies included more than 8,500 people with a broken hip. The people in these studies were older adults. Their ages were mostly between 60 and 84 years old. About 3 out of every 4 people in the studies were women.

The people in the studies had broken their hip from a simple fall. This is often because their bones were weaker. The researchers looked at how patients were doing up to one year after their surgery.

**Results**

The researchers compared the different tools used in surgery. They looked at how well people could move after surgery. They also looked at their quality of life. They checked if people needed another surgery because of a problem.

The main result was that there was very little or no difference between the tools.
*   When they compared screws to metal plates, they did not find a big difference in how well people recovered.
*   When they compared smooth pins to metal plates, they also found no clear winner.
*   When they compared screws to smooth pins, they again found no big difference.

The researchers said that they are not very sure about these results. This is because many of the studies they reviewed were small or had some weaknesses. They call this ""low-certainty evidence."" This means that future studies could find different results.

In the end, the researchers concluded that we do not have strong proof to say one tool is better than another. Based on the information we have now, pins, screws, and plates seem to work about the same. The researchers said that we need more and better studies to be more certain. Future studies should check on patients for a long time. They should look at how the surgery affects a person’s daily life and ability to move around.","Metal implants used to fix broken bones in the hip joint in older adults
This review assessed evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs, on the relative benefits and harms of different metal implants used to treat one type of hip fracture in older adults (aged 60 years or over). 
Background 
A hip fracture is a break at the top of the leg bone. We included people with a break just below the ball and socket joint. These types of broken hip are common in older adults whose bones may be fragile because of a condition called osteoporosis. They often happen after a fall from a standing or sitting position. A common way of mending this break is to fix the broken parts of bone with metal implants. During an operation, the surgeon may insert a smooth pin or screw through the two parts of broken bone. A smooth pin is not threaded like a screw but may have extra features such as a fold‐out hook. Alternatively, the surgeon may use a 'fixed angle plate' which sits on the outer edge of the broken bone and is attached to the bone with screws or pins. 
Search date 
We searched for RCTs (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), and quasi‐RCTs (in which people are put into groups by a method which is not randomised, such as date of birth or hospital record number), published up to 6 July 2020. 
Study characteristics 
We included 38 studies, involving 8585 adults with 8590 hip fractures. The average age of study participants ranged from 60 to 84 years; 73% were women, which is usual for people who have this type of hip fracture. 
Key results 
Smooth pins compared with fixed angle plates (four studies, 1313 participants): we are uncertain whether there is a difference between these implants in improving a person's ability to walk independently (with no more than one walking stick), in the number of people who die early (within four months of surgery) or up to 12 months after surgery, and in how many people need additional surgery (e.g. because of deep infection around the implant). 
Screws compared with fixed angle plates (11 studies, 2471 participants): we found no evidence of difference between these implants in hip function (ability to use the hip), health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), death at 12 months, and additional surgery. We are uncertain whether there is a difference between these implants in independent walking, and early deaths. 
Screws compared to smooth pins (seven studies, 1119 participants): we found no evidence of difference between these implants in deaths at 12 months. We are uncertain whether there is a difference between these implants in early deaths and additional surgery. 
Screws or pins compared with fixed angle plates (15 studies, 3784 participants): we found no evidence of difference between these implants in deaths at 12 months, or additional surgery. We are uncertain whether there is a difference between implants in independent walking and early death. We found no additional evidence for hip function or HRQoL. 
No studies in the review reported activities of daily living or delirium.
Certainty of the evidence 
Although there were some large studies, most of the evidence for each outcome came from only a few participants. Many older studies were not well reported. It was not possible to hide from the surgeons what type of fixing was used, which might affect a surgeon's decision on whether someone needed additional surgery. Sometimes, we found differences between the findings of individual studies that we could not explain. 
For these reasons, we assessed the evidence for the outcomes as either low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence. This means we had limited confidence or very little confidence in the results. 
Conclusions 
There may be little or no difference between screws and fixed angle plates in hip function, HRQoL, deaths at 12 months, and additional surgery, and between screws and pins in deaths at 12 months. But we are uncertain of the effects for other outcomes, including those for smooth pins versus fixed angle plates, because the evidence was very low‐certainty. More well‐designed RCTs on metal implants will be helpful.

10.1002-14651858.CD013790.pub2,"Background
Heated tobacco products (HTPs) are designed to heat tobacco to a high enough temperature to release aerosol, without burning it or producing smoke. They differ from e‐cigarettes because they heat tobacco leaf/sheet rather than a liquid. Companies who make HTPs claim they produce fewer harmful chemicals than conventional cigarettes. Some people report stopping smoking cigarettes entirely by switching to using HTPs, so clinicians need to know whether they are effective for this purpose and relatively safe. Also, to regulate HTPs appropriately, policymakers should understand their impact on health and on cigarette smoking prevalence. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of HTPs for smoking cessation and the impact of HTPs on smoking prevalence.  
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and six other databases for relevant records to January 2021, together with reference‐checking and contact with study authors and relevant groups. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which people who smoked cigarettes were randomised to switch to exclusive HTP use or a control condition. Eligible outcomes were smoking cessation, adverse events, and selected biomarkers.  RCTs conducted in clinic or in an ambulatory setting were deemed eligible when assessing safety, including those randomising participants to exclusively use HTPs, smoke cigarettes, or attempt abstinence from all tobacco. Time‐series studies were also eligible for inclusion if they examined the population‐level impact of heated tobacco on smoking prevalence or cigarette sales as an indirect measure. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. Our primary outcome measures were abstinence from smoking at the longest follow‐up point available, adverse events, serious adverse events, and changes in smoking prevalence or cigarette sales. Other outcomes included biomarkers of harm and exposure to toxicants/carcinogens (e.g. NNAL and carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb)). We used a random‐effects Mantel‐Haenszel model to calculate risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences on the log‐transformed scale (LMD) with 95% CIs. We pooled data across studies using meta‐analysis where possible. 
Main results
We included 13 completed studies, of which 11 were RCTs assessing safety (2666 participants) and two were time‐series studies. We judged eight RCTs to be at unclear risk of bias and three at high risk. All RCTs were funded by tobacco companies. Median length of follow‐up was 13 weeks. 
No studies reported smoking cessation outcomes. 
There was insufficient evidence for a difference in risk of adverse events between smokers randomised to switch to heated tobacco or continue smoking cigarettes, limited by imprecision and risk of bias (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.15; I2 = 0%; 6 studies, 1713 participants). There was insufficient evidence to determine whether risk of serious adverse events differed between groups due to very serious imprecision and risk of bias (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.94; I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 1472 participants). There was moderate‐certainty evidence for lower NNAL and COHb at follow‐up in heated tobacco than cigarette smoking groups, limited by risk of bias (NNAL: LMD −0.81, 95% CI −1.07 to −0.55; I2 = 92%; 10 studies, 1959 participants; COHb: LMD −0.74, 95% CI −0.92 to −0.52; I2 = 96%; 9 studies, 1807 participants). Evidence for additional biomarkers of exposure are reported in the main body of the review. 
There was insufficient evidence for a difference in risk of adverse events in smokers randomised to switch to heated tobacco or attempt abstinence from all tobacco, limited by risk of bias and imprecision (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.46; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 237 participants). Five studies reported that no serious adverse events occurred in either group (533 participants). There was moderate‐certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, that urine concentrations of NNAL at follow‐up were higher in the heated tobacco use compared with abstinence group (LMD 0.50, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.66; I2 = 0%; 5 studies, 382 participants). In addition, there was very low‐certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision, for higher COHb in the heated tobacco use compared with abstinence group for intention‐to‐treat analyses (LMD 0.69, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.31; 3 studies, 212 participants), but lower COHb in per‐protocol analyses (LMD −0.32, 95% CI −1.04 to 0.39; 2 studies, 170 participants). Evidence concerning additional biomarkers is reported in the main body of the review. 
Data from two time‐series studies showed that the rate of decline in cigarette sales accelerated following the introduction of heated tobacco to market in Japan. This evidence was of very low‐certainty as there was risk of bias, including possible confounding, and cigarette sales are an indirect measure of smoking prevalence. 
Authors' conclusions
No studies reported on cigarette smoking cessation, so the effectiveness of heated tobacco for this purpose remains uncertain. There was insufficient evidence for differences in risk of adverse or serious adverse events between people randomised to switch to heated tobacco, smoke cigarettes, or attempt tobacco abstinence in the short‐term. There was moderate‐certainty evidence that heated tobacco users have lower exposure to toxicants/carcinogens than cigarette smokers and very low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence of higher exposure than those attempting abstinence from  all tobacco. Independently funded research on the effectiveness and safety of HTPs is needed.  
The rate of decline in cigarette sales accelerated after the introduction of heated tobacco to market in Japan but, as data were observational, it is possible other factors caused these changes. Moreover, falls in cigarette sales may not translate to declining smoking prevalence, and changes in Japan may not generalise elsewhere. To clarify the impact of rising heated tobacco use on smoking prevalence, there is a need for time‐series studies that examine this association.

Are Heated Tobacco Products a Safe and Good Way to Quit Smoking? A Review of Studies

### **Rationale**

Many people smoke regular cigarettes. Smoking is very harmful to your health. It can cause serious problems like cancer and heart disease. Because of this, many people want to quit smoking.

New products called heated tobacco products are now sold. These products heat real tobacco to make a mist that people breathe in. They do not burn the tobacco like regular cigarettes do. The companies that make these products say they are less harmful than cigarettes. They say this because heating tobacco may release fewer harmful chemicals than burning it.

Some people have started using these heated tobacco products to try to quit smoking. But doctors and health experts do not know if this is a good idea. They need to know if these products really help people stop smoking. They also need to know if they are safer than regular cigarettes. This review looked at all the studies that have been done to find answers to these important questions.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked for all the good studies on heated tobacco products that had already been done. They wanted to combine the results to get a clearer picture.

The researchers looked at 13 studies. Most of these studies were designed in a special way. People who smoked cigarettes were put into different groups by chance.
*   One group was asked to switch to heated tobacco products.
*   Another group was asked to keep smoking regular cigarettes.
*   A third group was asked to try to quit using all tobacco products.

The people in these studies were adults who smoked. The studies checked them for any new health problems. They also measured the levels of harmful chemicals in their bodies. These studies were short. Most of them lasted for about 3 months. It is important to know that all of these studies were paid for by tobacco companies.

The researchers also looked at two other studies. These studies checked if sales of regular cigarettes changed after heated tobacco products started to be sold in a country.

### **Results**

**Do heated tobacco products help people quit smoking?**
The most important finding was that none of the studies looked at whether heated tobacco products helped people quit smoking regular cigarettes completely. Because of this, we still do not know if they are a good tool to help you quit.

**Are heated tobacco products safer than smoking?**
When researchers compared people using heated tobacco to people smoking regular cigarettes, they did not find a clear difference in short-term health problems. However, there was good evidence that people who switched to heated tobacco products had lower levels of some harmful chemicals in their bodies compared to those who kept smoking.

**Are heated tobacco products as safe as quitting?**
When researchers compared people using heated tobacco to people who tried to quit all tobacco, they again found no clear difference in short-term health problems. But, people using heated tobacco had *higher* levels of harmful chemicals in their bodies than people who quit all tobacco. This shows that quitting all tobacco is the best choice for your health.

**What happened to cigarette sales?**
In Japan, sales of regular cigarettes went down faster after heated tobacco products were introduced. But the researchers are not sure that the new products caused this change. Other things could have led to fewer cigarette sales.

**What did the researchers conclude?**
The researchers who did this review came to a few main conclusions.
1.  We do not know if heated tobacco products can help people stop smoking. No studies have tested this yet.
2.  In the short term, users of heated tobacco are exposed to fewer harmful chemicals than cigarette smokers. But they are exposed to more harmful chemicals than people who quit tobacco completely.
3.  We need new studies to learn about the long-term health effects of these products. These studies should be done by groups that are not paid for by tobacco companies to make sure the results are fair.","Do heated tobacco products help people to quit smoking, are they safe for this purpose, and have they led to falls in smoking rates? 
Key messages 
Heated tobacco probably exposes people to fewer toxins than cigarettes, but possibly more than not using any tobacco. Falls in cigarette sales appeared to speed up following the launch of heated tobacco in Japan, but we are uncertain whether this is caused by people switching from cigarettes to heated tobacco. 
We need more independently funded research into whether heated tobacco helps people stop smoking, whether it results in unwanted effects, and the impact of rising heated tobacco use on smoking rates.  
What are heated tobacco products?  
Heated tobacco products are designed to heat tobacco to a high enough temperature to release vapour, without burning it or producing smoke. They differ from e‐cigarettes because they heat tobacco leaf/sheet rather than a liquid. Many of the harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke are created by burning tobacco. So heating not burning tobacco could reduce the amount of chemicals a user ingests. Some people report stopping smoking cigarettes entirely by switching to using heated tobacco. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review  
Because cigarette smoking is addictive, many people find it difficult to stop despite the harm it causes. We aimed to find out whether trying to switch to heated tobacco helps people stop smoking cigarettes, and whether it results in unwanted effects. We also wanted to find out whether rising heated tobacco use has affected smoking rates or cigarette sales. 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies that reported on the use of heated tobacco for stopping smoking, and on unwanted effects and toxin exposure in people asked to use heated tobacco. Here we only included randomised controlled trials, where treatments were given to people at random. This type of study is considered the most reliable way of determining if a treatment works. Finally, we searched for studies looking at changes in smoking rates and cigarette sales following the launch of heated tobacco to market. We included studies published up to January 2021. 
What we found 
Our search found 13 relevant studies. No studies reported whether heated tobacco helps people stop smoking cigarettes. Eleven trials, all funded by tobacco companies and with 2666 adult smokers, compared unwanted effects and toxin levels in people randomly assigned to use heated tobacco or to continue smoking cigarettes or abstain from tobacco use. 
Two studies looked at how trends in cigarette sales changed following the launch of heated tobacco in Japan. 
What are the results of our review?  
We do not know whether using heated tobacco helps people to stop smoking cigarettes (no studies measured this). 
We are uncertain whether the chances of getting unwanted symptoms from being asked to use heated tobacco are different compared with cigarettes (6 studies, 1713 participants) or no tobacco (2 studies, 237 participants). Serious unwanted symptoms in the short time period studied (average 13 weeks) were rare in all groups, which means we are uncertain about any differences. Toxin levels were probably lower in people using heated tobacco than those smoking cigarettes (10 studies, 1959 participants), but may be higher than in people not using any tobacco products (5 studies, 382 participants). 
The launch of heated tobacco products in Japan may have caused the decline in cigarette sales to speed up over time (two studies), but it is unclear whether the fall in the percentage of people who smoke also sped up because no studies looked at this.  
How reliable are these results? 
Results are based on data from a small number of studies, most of which were funded by tobacco companies.  
Results on unwanted effects are likely to change as more evidence becomes available. However, we are moderately confident that levels of measured toxins are lower in people using heated tobacco than smoking cigarettes, but less confident that levels were higher than in people not using any tobacco. We are also less confident that the launch of heated tobacco caused the fall in cigarette sales to speed up, as results came from a single country.

10.1002-14651858.CD013273,"Background
Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is vastly recommended as the first‐line analgesic for osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. However, there has been controversy about this recommendation given recent studies have revealed small effects of paracetamol when compared with placebo. Nonetheless, past studies have not systematically reviewed and appraised the literature to investigate the effects of this drug on specific osteoarthritis sites, that is, hip or knee, or on the dose used. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of paracetamol compared with placebo in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, CINAHL, Web of Science, LILACS, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts to 3 October 2017, and ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal on 20 October 2017. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials comparing paracetamol with placebo in adults with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. Major outcomes were pain, function, quality of life, adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and abnormal liver function tests. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors used standard Cochrane methods to collect data, and assess risk of bias and quality of the evidence. For pooling purposes, we converted pain and physical function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function) scores to a common 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst possible pain or disability) scale. 
Main results
We identified 10 randomised placebo‐controlled trials involving 3541 participants with hip or knee osteoarthritis. The paracetamol dose varied from 1.95 g/day to 4 g/day, and the majority of trials followed participants for three months only. Most trials did not clearly report randomisation and concealment methods and were at unclear risk of selection bias. Trials were at low risk of performance, detection, and reporting bias. 
At 3 weeks' to 3 months' follow‐up, there was high‐quality evidence that paracetamol provided no clinically important improvements in pain and physical function. Mean reduction in pain was 23 points (0 to 100 scale, lower scores indicated less pain) with placebo and 3.23 points better (5.43 better to 1.02 better) with paracetamol, an absolute reduction of 3% (1% better to 5% better, minimal clinical important difference 9%) and relative reduction of 5% (2% better to 8% better) (seven trials, 2355 participants). Physical function improved by 12 points on a 0 to 100 scale (lower scores indicated better function) with placebo and was 2.9 points better (0.95 better to 4.89 better) with paracetamol, an absolute improvement of 3% (1% better to 5% better, minimal clinical important difference 10%) and relative improvement of 5% (2% better to 9% better) (7 trials, 2354 participants). 
High‐quality evidence from eight trials indicated that the incidence of adverse events was similar between groups: 515/1586 (325 per 1000) in the placebo group versus 537/1666 (328 per 1000, range 299 to 360) in the paracetamol group (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.11). There was less certainty (moderate‐quality evidence) around the risk of serious adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, and the rate of abnormal liver function tests, due to wide CIs or small event rates, indicating imprecision. Seventeen of 1480 (11 per 1000) people treated with placebo and 28/1729 (16 per 1000, range 8 to 29) people treated with paracetamol experienced serious adverse events (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.53; 6 trials). The incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 65/1000 participants in with placebo and 77/1000 (range 59 to 100) participants with paracetamol (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.55; 7 trials). Abnormal liver function occurred in 18/1000 participants treated with placebo and 70/1000 participants treated with paracetamol (RR 3.79, 95% CI 1.94 to 7.39), but the clinical importance of this effect was uncertain. None of the trials reported quality of life. 
Subgroup analyses indicated that the effects of paracetamol on pain and function did not differ according to the dose of paracetamol (3.0 g/day or less versus 3.9 g/day or greater). 
Authors' conclusions
Based on high‐quality evidence this review confirms that paracetamol provides only minimal improvements in pain and function for people with hip or knee osteoarthritis, with no increased risk of adverse events overall. Subgroup analysis indicates that the effects on pain and function do not differ according to the dose of paracetamol. Due to the small number of events, we are less certain if paracetamol use increases the risk of serious adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, and rate of abnormal liver function tests. 
Current clinical guidelines consistently recommend paracetamol as the first‐line analgesic medication for hip or knee osteoarthritis, given its low absolute frequency of substantive harm. However, our results call for reconsideration of these recommendations.

Does Paracetamol Help with Joint Pain in the Hip or Knee?

### **Rationale**

Many people have a condition called osteoarthritis. This is a common type of joint pain that often affects the hips and knees. It happens when the soft cushion at the end of the bones wears down over time. This can cause pain, swelling, and stiffness in the joints. This pain can make it hard to do daily tasks like walking or climbing stairs.

Doctors often suggest a pain reliever called paracetamol as the first treatment for this pain. You may know this medicine by brand names like Tylenol or Panadol. But some recent studies have raised questions about how well it works. They found that paracetamol may not help much more than a fake pill with no medicine in it.

This study was done to get a clear answer. Researchers wanted to combine the results from many past studies. Their goal was to find out if paracetamol really helps reduce pain and improve movement for people with hip or knee osteoarthritis. They also wanted to see if it was safe to use for this condition.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers did a review of older studies to find the best evidence. They looked for a specific type of study called a ""randomised controlled trial.""

In these types of studies, people are put into groups by chance, like flipping a coin. One group gets the real medicine, in this case, paracetamol. The other group gets a ""placebo."" A placebo is a fake pill, like a sugar pill, that has no medicine in it. This helps researchers see if the real medicine works better than just thinking you are getting a treatment.

The researchers found 10 good studies to include in their review. In total, these studies had about 3,500 adult men and women. All of them had pain from osteoarthritis in their hip or knee. Most of the studies lasted for 3 months. During this time, people took either paracetamol or a placebo pill each day.

### **Results**

The main results of this review showed that paracetamol gave very little help for pain or movement.

For pain, the difference between paracetamol and the fake pill was very small. On a pain scale from 0 to 100, people who took the fake pill said their pain got better by about 23 points. People who took paracetamol said their pain got better by about 26 points. This tiny 3-point difference is not large enough for most people to notice in their daily life.

The results were similar for movement and daily function. People in both groups were able to move a little better. But again, the difference between the paracetamol group and the fake pill group was too small to make a real change in their lives. The dose of paracetamol did not seem to matter. People who took higher doses did not get any more relief than people who took lower doses.

The study also looked at side effects. About the same number of people had side effects in both groups. This means that overall, paracetamol was not more likely to cause problems than the fake pill. There was a small chance that paracetamol could cause unusual results on liver tests. The researchers were not sure if this was a serious health risk because it did not happen to many people.

The researchers concluded that paracetamol does not provide important benefits for people with hip or knee osteoarthritis. Because it helps so little, they suggest that doctors should rethink the advice to use paracetamol as the first-choice treatment for this type of joint pain.","Paracetamol for treating people with hip or knee osteoarthritis
Background 
Osteoarthritis of the hip or knee is a progressive disabling disease affecting many people worldwide. Although paracetamol is widely used as a treatment option for this condition, recent studies have called into question how effective this pain relief medication is. 
Search date 
This review includes all trials published up to 3 October 2017.
Study characteristics 
We included randomised clinical trials (where people are randomly put into one of two treatment groups) looking at the effects of paracetamol for people with hip or knee pain due to osteoarthritis against a placebo (a 'sugar tablet' that contains nothing that could act as a medicine). We found 10 trials with 3541 participants. On average, participants in the study were aged between 55 and 70 years, and most presented with knee osteoarthritis. The treatment dose ranged from 1.95 g/day to 4 g/day of paracetamol and participants were followed up between one and 12 weeks in all but one study, which followed people up for 24 weeks. Six trials were funded by companies that produced paracetamol. 
Key results 
Compared with placebo tablets, paracetamol resulted in little benefit at 12 weeks.
Pain (lower scores mean less pain) 
Improved by 3% (1% better to 5% better), or 3.2 points (1 better to 5.4 better) on a 0‐ to 100‐point scale. 
• People who took paracetamol reported that their pain improved by 26 points.
• People who took placebo reported that their pain improved by 23 points.
Physical function (lower scores mean better function) 
Improved by 3% (1% better to 5% better), or 2.9 points (1.0 better to 4.9 better) on a 0‐ to 100‐point scale. 
• People who took paracetamol reported that their function improved by 15 points.
• People who had placebo reported that their function improved by 12 points.
Side effects (up to 12 to 24 weeks) 
No more people had side effects with paracetamol (3% less to 3% more), or 0 more people out of 100. 
• 33 out of 100 people reported a side effect with paracetamol.
• 33 out of 100 people reported a side effect with placebo.
Serious side effects (up to 12 to 24 weeks) 
1% more people had serious side effects with paracetamol (0% less to 1% more), or one more person out of 100. 
• Two out of 100 people reported a serious side effect with paracetamol.
• One out of 100 people reported a serious side effect with placebo.
Withdrawals due to adverse events (up to 12 to 24 weeks) 
1% more people withdrew from treatment with paracetamol (1% less to 3% more), or one more person out of 100. 
• Eight out of 100 people withdrew from paracetamol treatment.
• Seven out of 100 people withdrew from placebo treatment.
Abnormal liver function tests (up to 12 to 24 weeks): 
5% more people had abnormal liver function tests (meaning there was some inflammation or damage to the liver) with paracetamol (1% more to 10% more), or five more people out of 100. 
• Seven out of 100 people had an abnormal liver function test with paracetamol.
• Two out of 100 people had an abnormal liver function test with placebo.
Quality of the evidence 
High‐quality evidence indicated that paracetamol provided only minimal improvements in pain and function for people with hip or knee osteoarthritis, with no increased risk of adverse events overall. None of the studies measured quality of life. Due to the small number of events, we were less certain if paracetamol use increased the risk of serious side effects, increased withdrawals due to side effects, and changed the rate of abnormal liver function tests. However, although there may be more abnormal liver function tests with paracetamol, the clinical implications are unknown.

The balance of benefits and harms associated with enteral tube feeding for people with severe dementia is not clear. An increasing number of guidelines highlight the lack of evidenced benefit and potential risks of enteral tube feeding. In some areas of the world, the use of enteral tube feeding is decreasing, and in other areas it is increasing. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of enteral tube feeding for people with severe dementia who develop problems with eating and swallowing or who have reduced food and fluid intake. 
Search methods
We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases and two trials registers on 14 April 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), or controlled non‐randomised studies. Our population of interest was adults of any age with a diagnosis of primary degenerative dementia of any cause, with severe cognitive and functional impairment, and poor nutritional intake. Eligible studies evaluated the effectiveness and complications of enteral tube feeding via a nasogastric or gastrostomy tube, or via jejunal post‐pyloric feeding, in comparison with standard care or enhanced standard care, such as an intervention to promote oral intake. Our primary outcomes were survival time, quality of life, and pressure ulcers. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors screened citations and two review authors assessed full texts of potentially eligible studies against inclusion criteria. One review author extracted data, which were then checked independently by a second review author. We used the 'Risk Of Bias In Non‐randomised Studies of Interventions' (ROBINS‐I) tool to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. Risk of confounding was assessed against a pre‐agreed list of key potential confounding variables. Our primary outcomes were survival time, quality of life, and pressure ulcers. Results were not suitable for meta‐analysis, so we presented them narratively. We presented results separately for studies of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding, nasogastric tube feeding and studies using mixed or unspecified enteral tube feeding methods. We used GRADE methods to assess the overall certainty of the evidence related to each outcome for each study. 
Main results
We found no eligible RCTs. We included fourteen controlled, non‐randomised studies. All the included studies compared outcomes between groups of people who had been assigned to enteral tube feeding or oral feeding by prior decision of a healthcare professional. Some studies controlled for a range of confounding factors, but there were high or very high risks of bias due to confounding in all studies, and high or critical risks of selection bias in some studies. 
Four studies with 36,816 participants assessed the effect of PEG feeding on survival time. None found any evidence of effects on survival time (low‐certainty evidence). 
Three of four studies using mixed or unspecified enteral tube feeding methods in 310 participants (227 enteral tube feeding, 83 no enteral tube feeding) found them to be associated with longer survival time. The fourth study (1386 participants: 135 enteral tube feeding, 1251 no enteral tube feeding) found no evidence of an effect. The certainty of this body of evidence is very low. 
One study of PEG feeding (4421 participants: 1585 PEG, 2836 no enteral tube feeding) found PEG feeding increased the risk of pressure ulcers (moderate‐certainty evidence). Two of three studies reported an increase in the number of pressure ulcers in those receiving mixed or unspecified enteral tube feeding (234 participants: 88 enteral tube feeding, 146 no enteral tube feeding). The third study found no effect (very‐low certainty evidence).  
Two studies of nasogastric tube feeding did not report data on survival time or pressure ulcers. 
None of the included studies assessed quality of life.
Only one study, using mixed methods of enteral tube feeding, reported on pain and comfort, finding no difference between groups. In the same study, a higher proportion of carers reported very heavy burden in the enteral tube feeding group compared to no enteral tube feeding. 
Two studies assessed the effect of nasogastric tube feeding on mortality (236 participants: 144 nasogastric group, 92 no enteral tube feeding). One study of 67 participants (14 nasogastric, 53 no enteral tube feeding) found nasogastric feeding was associated with increased mortality risk. The second study found no difference in mortality between groups. The certainty of this evidence is very low. Results on mortality for those using PEG or mixed methods of enteral tube feeding were mixed and the certainty of evidence was very low. There was some evidence from two studies for enteral tube feeding improving nutritional parameters, but this was very low‐certainty evidence. Five studies reported a variety of harm‐related outcomes with inconsistent results. The balance of evidence suggested increased risk of pneumonia with enteral tube feeding. 
None of the included studies assessed behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia.
Authors' conclusions
We found no evidence that tube feeding improves survival; improves quality of life; reduces pain; reduces mortality; decreases behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia; leads to better nourishment; improves family or carer outcomes such as depression, anxiety, carer burden, or satisfaction with care; and no indication of harm. We found some evidence that there is a clinically significant risk of pressure ulcers from enteral tube feeding. Future research should focus on better reporting and matching of control and intervention groups, and clearly defined interventions, measuring all the outcomes referred to here.

Is Tube Feeding Helpful for People with Severe Dementia?

### **Rationale**

Dementia is a health problem that affects the brain. It can make it hard to think and remember. When dementia is severe, people may have a hard time eating or swallowing. This can cause them to lose weight and have other health problems.

To help, doctors sometimes use a feeding tube. A feeding tube is a soft tube that carries liquid food right to the stomach. But we do not know if tube feeding is truly helpful for people with severe dementia. Some people think it helps them live longer and be more comfortable. Others worry it could cause harm, like pain or sores.

Doctors around the world have different ideas about using feeding tubes. This study was done to look at all the past research on this topic. The goal was to find out if tube feeding helps or hurts people with severe dementia.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with patients. Instead, the researchers looked for and reviewed studies that were already done. This is called a research review. They looked for studies about adults who had severe dementia and problems eating.

The studies they reviewed compared two groups of people. One group got food through a feeding tube. The other group got regular care, which often included help with eating by mouth.

The researchers wanted to see if there were differences between the two groups. They looked at how long people lived. They also looked for harms, like getting painful skin sores called pressure sores. Because this was a review of past studies, people did not have to join a new trial or spend any extra time in a study.

### **Results**

The researchers found 14 studies to review. They found no strong proof that tube feeding helps people with severe dementia. The results from these studies were not very certain.

The review showed that tube feeding did not seem to help people live longer. None of the studies looked at whether tube feeding made a person’s quality of life better or worse. This means we do not know if it made people feel more comfortable.

The review did find some possible harms. People with feeding tubes seemed to have a higher chance of getting pressure sores. These are also known as bedsores. There was also some proof that tube feeding could raise the risk of a lung infection called pneumonia.

One study showed that family members who cared for a person with a tube felt a heavier burden. The researchers concluded that there is no good proof that tube feeding helps. They found that it might cause harm, like pressure sores. They believe we need better studies in the future to find the best way to care for people with severe dementia who have trouble eating.","Enteral tube feeding for people with severe dementia
What are the advantages and problems of tube feeding people with severe dementia?  
Key messages 
Tube feeding may not increase the length of time people with severe dementia live compared to no tube feeding. The risk of developing a pressure sore is probably higher with a feeding tube than with no tube. No studies looked at quality of life.We need more and better studies to investigate tube feeding people with severe dementia. Future studies should focus on a broader range of outcomes including, pain, quality of life and the impact on carers 
What is tube feeding? 
Somebody who can’t eat or drink through their mouth may be given liquid food through a tube into their stomach. This is called enteral tube feeding. The tube passes through their nose into their stomach (a nasogastric tube), or is inserted into the stomach through a small cut in their belly (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy or PEG).  
Why is this important for people with dementia? 
People with dementia often have difficulties eating and drinking. During the early stages of dementia, they may forget to eat, chew food without swallowing, or be confused at mealtimes. Some people experience changes in the taste and smell of food. In the later stages of dementia, people often have difficulties swallowing.  It can be difficult to ensure they receive appropriate food and fluids.  
People with severe dementia need full‐time care, and it is often their families who care for them. It is difficult to decide whether or not to tube‐feed someone with dementia because the feeding tube can be uncomfortable or even painful, and may cause other unwanted effects such as pneumonia, worsen bowel or bladder control, as well as bleeding, swelling and infection. People with severe dementia may be confused or distressed by the tube and may try to remove it.  
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether tube feeding helps people with severe dementia who have problems with eating and swallowing.  
We were interested in the effect of tube feeding on:
how long people lived; 
their quality of life (well‐being); and 
the development or healing of pressure sores (also known as bed sores).
What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated whether: 
PEG compared to no tube; a nasogastric tube compared to no tube; orPEG, nasogastric and other types of tube feeding compared to no tube 
was effective and whether tube feeding caused any unwanted effects in adults of any age with severe dementia and poor intake of food and drink.  
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find?  
We included 14 studies that included 49,714 participants. Of these, 6203 were tube‐fed and 43,511 were not. Participants with no feeding tube were given standard care or standard care with extra treatments to encourage eating and drinking. 
Main results 
In people with severe dementia, compared to no tube feeding:
PEG may make no difference to how long people live (4 studies, 36,816 people), and leads to a small increase in the chance of developing pressure sores (1 study, 4421 people). we don’t know if nasogastric tube feeding increases the length of time people live or increases their chance of developing pressure sores, because none of our included studies gave information about these points. Studies of people with either PEG or nasogastric tubes showed tube feeding may increase the length of time people live (4 studies, 1696 people), and may slightly increase the chance of developing pressure sores (3 studies, 351 people).  
None of our included studies reported quality of life.
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We have moderate confidence in our finding that pressure ulcers were more common in people who were fed with a PEG tube. However, we have little to very little confidence for our other findings.  
Three main factors reduced our confidence in the evidence. Firstly, people in the studies were not randomly placed into different treatment groups. This means that differences between the groups could be due to differences between people rather than between the treatments. However, due to ethical considerations it would be very difficult to do this in future studies. Secondly, results were very inconsistent across the different studies. Finally, some studies were very small.  
The results of further research could differ from the results of this review.
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to 14 April 2021.

What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
Overall, we did not identify any evidence of an effect of mindfulness‐based interventions on anxiety or depression symptoms. However, mindfulness‐based interventions appeared to have a small positive effect on stress and a borderline positive effect on burnout. We were unable to report if mindfulness‐based interventions had any effect on deliberate self‐harm, suicidal ideation or suicidal behaviour as no studies examined these outcomes.

Can Learning Mindfulness Help Medical Students and New Doctors with Stress?

### **Rationale**

Being a doctor is a hard job. People who are training to be doctors often feel a lot of stress. This can affect their mental health and make them feel unwell. It is very important to support these students and new doctors. When they feel well, they can take better care of their patients.

Students and new doctors are also very busy. They do not have a lot of free time. This study wanted to find out if learning mindfulness is a good use of their time to help them feel better. Mindfulness is a practice of paying attention to the present moment without judgment. It is thought to help people manage stress.

Researchers wanted to bring together all the past studies on this topic. By looking at all the studies at once, they hoped to get a clear answer. This would help schools and hospitals know if they should offer mindfulness training.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers did a review. This means they searched for and looked at studies that were already completed.

The researchers looked for a special kind of study called a randomized controlled trial. In these types of studies, people are put into groups by chance, like flipping a coin. One group learns mindfulness. The other group does not. Then, the researchers compare the two groups to see if mindfulness made a difference. This is a fair way to test if a treatment works.

This review included 10 different studies. A total of 731 people took part in those studies. The people in the studies were all medical students or doctors in their first three years of training. The review included people of any age or background from studies published up to October 2021.

### **Results**

The review found that mindfulness training did not seem to help lower feelings of anxiety or depression in students and new doctors.

However, the training did seem to have a small positive effect on stress. People who learned mindfulness felt a little less stressed. The training may have also helped a little with feelings of burnout. Burnout is when you feel very worn out and emotionally tired from your job.

The researchers could not find out if mindfulness helps with very serious problems, like self-harm or thoughts of suicide. This is because none of the studies they looked at collected this information. Also, most studies did not check in with people a long time after the training ended. Because of this, we do not know if the good effects of mindfulness last over time.

The researchers concluded that the proof from these studies was not very strong. They said the quality of the evidence was ""low"" or ""very low."" They believe that more research is needed. Future studies should be designed very carefully. They should also follow people for a longer time to see what happens in the long run.","Mindfulness for improving mental well‐being in medical students and junior doctors

Background 
In vitro fertilisation (IVF) with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is a commonly used treatment for subfertile couples. It is thought that the selection of high‐quality sperm may improve outcomes for these couples. Advanced sperm selection techniques use complex methods to select healthy, mature, and structurally sound sperm for fertilisation. Despite the use of these techniques in many centres worldwide, their effectiveness is unclear.

We included eight randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) with a total of 4147 women. Four studies evaluated sperm selection by their ability to bind to hyaluronic acid during the ICSI process (HA‐ICSI) against ICSI. One study compared HA‐ICSI versus SpermSlow. One study compared HA‐ICSI versus magnetic‐activated cell sorting (MACS) versus ICSI. Three studies compared MACS versus ICSI. One study compared sperm selection by surface charge Zeta potential versus ICSI. Six of the included studies reported rates of live birth; seven reported clinical pregnancy; six reported miscarriage per clinical pregnancy and per woman randomly assigned; and none reported on foetal abnormalities. 
Key results 
The current evidence suggests that advanced sperm selection strategies in assisted reproductive technologist (ART) may not result in an increase in the likelihood of live birth. The only sperm selection technique that potentially increases live birth and clinical pregnancy rates is Zeta sperm selection, yet these results were of very low quality and derived from a single study, therefore we are uncertain of the effect. There is low‐quality evidence that HA‐ICSI decreases miscarriage rates when compared with ICSI. We are uncertain whether the other sperm selection techniques alter clinical pregnancy or miscarriage rates. No studies reported on foetal abnormalities, and further studies of suitable quality are required before any of these advanced sperm selection techniques can be recommended for use in clinical practice.

Choosing the Best Sperm for Fertility Treatments: Do New Methods Help?

### **Rationale**

Some couples have trouble getting pregnant. They may need medical help to have a baby. One type of help is called in vitro fertilization, or IVF. In IVF, doctors join a woman’s egg with a man’s sperm in a lab.

Doctors believe that picking the healthiest sperm could improve the chance of having a baby. There are new, advanced ways to pick the best sperm. But we are not sure if these new ways work better than the standard method.

This review looked at past studies to find out. The main question was: Do these new ways of picking sperm help more people have a live baby? Researchers also wanted to know if these methods changed the number of pregnancies or miscarriages.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new medical study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at studies that were already done. They combined the results to get a clearer answer.

They found 8 studies to review. In total, these studies included 4,147 women who were getting help to become pregnant. The studies were set up to be fair. Women were put into different groups by chance.

Some groups used the standard way to prepare sperm for IVF. Other groups used one of the new, advanced ways to pick sperm. These new ways included:

*   Using a sticky gel that healthy sperm stick to.
*   Using tiny magnets to remove unhealthy sperm.
*   Using an electric charge to find the best sperm.

The researchers then compared the results from all the groups.

### **Results**

The review found that most of the new ways of picking sperm did not seem to help. Overall, they did not increase the chance of having a live baby.

One method, which uses an electric charge, might increase the chance of having a baby. But this was seen in only one small study. The proof was not very strong, so we cannot be sure about this result.

The method that uses a sticky gel might lower the chance of a miscarriage. A miscarriage is when a pregnancy ends on its own. But the proof for this was also not very strong. For the other new methods, we are not sure if they help at all.

None of the studies reported if the babies born had any health problems. This is very important information that is still missing.

The researchers who did the review came to a clear conclusion. The studies they looked at were small or had other problems. This means we cannot be sure about the results. We need bigger and better studies before doctors can recommend using these new sperm selection methods in their clinics.","Advanced sperm selection techniques for assisted reproduction

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome was the number of participants in each arm achieving at least 50% pain relief over a four‐ and six‐hour period.Our secondary outcomes were time to and number of participants using rescue medication; withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, adverse events (AEs), and for any other cause; and number of participants experiencing any AE, serious AEs (SAEs), and NSAID‐related or opioid‐related AEs.For subgroup analysis, we planned to analyze different doses of parenteral ketorolac separately and to analyze results based on the type of surgery performed.We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 12 studies, involving 1905 participants undergoing various surgeries (pelvic/abdominal, dental, and orthopedic), with 17 to 83 participants receiving intravenous ketorolac in each study. Mean study population ages ranged from 22.5 years to 67.4 years. Most studies administered a dose of ketorolac of 30 mg; one study assessed 15 mg, and another administered 60 mg. 
Most studies had an unclear risk of bias for some domains, particularly allocation concealment and blinding, and a high risk of bias due to small sample size. The overall certainty of evidence for each outcome ranged from very low to moderate. Reasons for downgrading certainty included serious study limitations, inconsistency and imprecision. 
Ketorolac versus placebo 
Very low‐certainty evidence from eight studies (658 participants) suggests that ketorolac results in a large increase in the number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief over four hours compared to placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 2.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.80 to 4.37). The number needed to treat for one additional participant to benefit (NNTB) was 2.4 (95% CI 1.8 to 3.7). Low‐certainty evidence from 10 studies (914 participants) demonstrates that ketorolac may result in a large increase in the number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief over six hours compared to placebo (RR 3.26, 95% CI 1.93 to 5.51). The NNTB was 2.5 (95% CI 1.9 to 3.7). 
Among secondary outcomes, for time to rescue medication, moderate‐certainty evidence comparing intravenous ketorolac versus placebo demonstrated a mean median of 271 minutes for ketorolac versus 104 minutes for placebo (6 studies, 633 participants). For the number of participants using rescue medication, very low‐certainty evidence from five studies (417 participants) compared ketorolac with placebo. The RR was 0.60 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.00), that is, it did not demonstrate a difference between groups. 
Ketorolac probably results in a slight increase in total adverse event rates compared with placebo (74% versus 65%; 8 studies, 810 participants; RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.19; number needed to treat for an additional harmful event (NNTH) 16.7, 95% CI 8.3 to infinite, moderate‐certainty evidence). Serious AEs were rare. Low‐certainty evidence from eight studies (703 participants) did not demonstrate a difference in rates between ketorolac and placebo (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.13 to 3.03). 
Ketorolac versus NSAIDs Ketorolac was compared to parecoxib in four studies and diclofenac in two studies. For our primary outcome, over both four and six hours there was no evidence of a difference between intravenous ketorolac and another NSAID (low‐certainty and moderate‐certainty evidence, respectively). Over four hours, four studies (337 participants) produced an RR of 1.04 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.21) and over six hours, six studies (603 participants) produced an RR of 1.06 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.19). 
For time to rescue medication, low‐certainty evidence from four studies (427 participants) suggested that participants receiving ketorolac waited an extra 35 minutes (mean median 331 minutes versus 296 minutes). For the number of participants using rescue medication, very low‐certainty evidence from three studies (260 participants) compared ketorolac with another NSAID. The RR was 0.90 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.40), that is, there may be little or no difference between groups.   
Ketorolac probably results in a slight increase in total adverse event rates compared with another NSAID (76% versus 68%, 5 studies, 516 participants; RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.23; NNTH 12.5, 95% CI 6.7 to infinite, moderate‐certainty evidence). Serious AEs were rare. Low‐certainty evidence from five studies (530 participants) did not demonstrate a difference in rates between ketorolac and another NSAID (RR 3.18, 95% CI 0.13 to 76.99). Only one of the five studies reported a single serious AE. 
Authors' conclusions
The amount and certainty of evidence for the use of intravenous ketorolac as a treatment for postoperative pain varies across efficacy and safety outcomes and amongst comparators, from very low to moderate. The available evidence indicates that postoperative intravenous ketorolac administration may offer substantial pain relief for most patients, but further research may impact this estimate. Adverse events appear to occur at a slightly higher rate in comparison to placebo and to other NSAIDs. Insufficient information is available to assess whether intravenous ketorolac has a different rate of gastrointestinal or surgical‐site bleeding, renal dysfunction, or cardiovascular events versus other NSAIDs. There was a lack of studies in cardiovascular surgeries and in elderly populations who may be at increased risk for adverse events.

### **Plain Title**

Does a single shot of the pain drug ketorolac work well for pain after surgery? A review of studies.

### **Rationale**

**What is the problem?**
Many people have pain after an operation. Sometimes, this pain can be very bad. Doctors often use strong pain drugs called opioids to treat this pain. But opioids can cause problems. They can make you feel sick, sleepy, or cause other side effects.

**Why did we do this study?**
We wanted to see if another type of pain drug could help. These drugs are called NSAIDs. Ketorolac is an NSAID. We think that giving patients ketorolac after surgery can help control their pain. If their pain is controlled, they may need fewer opioids. This could mean they have fewer side effects from the opioids.

This study looked at past research to find out how well a single shot of ketorolac works. We wanted to see if it was better than a fake shot with no medicine in it, called a placebo. We also wanted to see how it compared to other similar NSAID pain drugs.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**
We did not do a new study with new patients. Instead, we looked for all the best studies that were already done. We gathered the results from 12 different studies.

In these studies, patients were put into groups by chance. Neither the doctors nor the patients knew who got the real drug. Some patients got a shot of ketorolac. Other patients got a fake shot (placebo) or a shot of a different NSAID pain drug.

**Who was in the studies?**
In total, the 12 studies included 1,905 adults. These were men and women who had different kinds of surgery. Some had surgery on their teeth. Others had surgery on their bones or in their stomach area. The average age of people in the studies was between 22 and 67 years old.

**What did the studies measure?**
The studies checked how much pain relief people felt in the first 4 to 6 hours after getting the shot. They also watched to see if people needed more pain medicine and what side effects they had. Side effects are any unwanted problems a drug may cause.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**
We compared the results from the different groups in the studies. Here is what we found.

**Ketorolac compared to a fake shot (placebo)**
*   **Pain Relief:** Ketorolac helped reduce pain much more than a fake shot. For every 4 people who got ketorolac, about 3 had their pain cut in half. For every 4 people who got the fake shot, only 1 had their pain cut in half.
*   **Need for more pain medicine:** People who got ketorolac could wait longer before needing more pain medicine. They waited about 4 and a half hours on average. People who got the fake shot needed more pain medicine in less than 2 hours.
*   **Side Effects:** People who got ketorolac had a slightly higher chance of having side effects. For every 17 people who got ketorolac, 1 extra person had a side effect compared to the group that got the fake shot. Very serious side effects were rare in both groups.

**Ketorolac compared to other similar pain drugs (NSAIDs)**
*   **Pain Relief:** Ketorolac worked about the same as other NSAID pain drugs. There was no real difference in how many people felt good pain relief.
*   **Need for more pain medicine:** There was also little to no difference in how long people could wait before needing more pain medicine.
*   **Side Effects:** Ketorolac may have caused slightly more side effects than other NSAIDs. For every 13 people who got ketorolac, 1 extra person had a side effect compared to those who got other NSAIDs. Serious side effects were very rare.

**What do these results mean?**
A single shot of ketorolac after surgery can give good pain relief to most patients. It works better than no medicine at all. It works about as well as other similar pain drugs.

However, ketorolac may have a slightly higher chance of causing side effects. Also, the studies we looked at were not all perfect. Some were small, which makes us less sure about the results. We need more and better research. We especially need to know if ketorolac is safe for older adults or for people having heart surgery.","What are the benefits and risks of a single injection of ketorolac (an anti‐inflammation medicine) for relieving short‐term pain after surgery in adults? 
Key messages 
· Ketorolac may reduce short‐term pain after surgery by 50% (half) or more in more people than a placebo (dummy treatment).· There may be little to no difference between ketorolac and other anti‐inflammation medicines in the number of people whose pain is reduced by half or more.· Ketorolac probably causes slightly more unwanted effects than placebo and other anti‐inflammation medicines; more evidence is required to establish if it causes serious unwanted effects. 
Treating short‐term pain after surgery 
It is common for people to feel pain in the short term (within six hours) after surgery. Often, medicines called non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are given to relieve this pain. 
NSAIDS work by stopping the body’s production of chemicals that cause inflammation and pain. A potential advantage of using NSAIDs is that they may limit the need for stronger pain‐relief medicine such as opioids. Opioids can cause unwanted (adverse) events such as nausea and vomiting, constipation, breathing problems and allergic reactions. People may become addicted to opioids if they take a lot of them. 
NSAIDs can also cause unwanted effects. These include bleeding at the site of the surgical wound, and potential injury to the kidneys and gut. It is therefore important to weigh the benefits and risks of NSAIDs when considering using them to reduce pain shortly after surgery. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out about the benefits and risks of using a specific NSAID, ketorolac, for relief of short‐term pain after surgery. Ketorolac can be given as an injection, which may be useful when patients cannot take medicines by mouth. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that involved adults (aged over 18) and compared a single injection of ketorolac against: 
· a placebo (dummy treatment); or· another treatment. 
We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found 12 studies that involved 1905 people in total. The studies investigated the treatment of pain after surgery on the abdomen, pelvis, teeth, bones, joints and muscles. Most studies (10) treated people with a dose of 30 milligrams of ketorolac. They compared ketorolac against: 
· a placebo;· another NSAID; or· an opioid. 
Here we present the findings from comparisons between ketorolac and placebo or other NSAIDs. 
Pain reduction 
The evidence suggests that:
· around three times more people may have their pain reduced by 50% (half) or more within six hours of surgery when treated with ketorolac rather than placebo; and· there could be little to no difference between ketorolac and other NSAIDS in the number of people with pain reduced by 50% or more within four or six hours of surgery. 
Need for extra pain medicines (rescue medication) 
Ketorolac could delay the need for rescue medication compared to placebo or other NSAIDs. The evidence is not robust enough to show if fewer people need rescue medicine when treated with ketorolac. 
Adverse effects 
Ketorolac probably causes slightly more adverse effects than placebo and other NSAIDS. Serious adverse effects (such as blood collecting in the muscles around the abdomen, causing severe pain) were rare in the studies we found; the evidence suggested there may be little to no difference in the number of serious adverse events between ketorolac and placebo or other NSAIDS. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Studies were small, and most may have been conducted in ways that could introduce errors into their results. This limited our confidence in the evidence. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to April 2020.

Delirium is an acute neuropsychological disorder that is common in hospitalised patients. It can be distressing to patients and carers and it is associated with serious adverse outcomes. Treatment options for established delirium are limited and so prevention of delirium is desirable. Non‐pharmacological interventions are thought to be important in delirium prevention.  
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of non‐pharmacological interventions designed to prevent delirium in hospitalised patients outside intensive care units (ICU). 
Search methods
We searched ALOIS, the specialised register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, with additional searches conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization Portal/ICTRP to 16 September 2020. There were no language or date restrictions applied to the electronic searches, and no methodological filters were used to restrict the search. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of single and multicomponent non‐pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised adults cared for outside intensive care or high dependency settings. We only included non‐pharmacological interventions which were designed and implemented to prevent delirium.  
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently examined titles and abstracts identified by the search for eligibility and extracted data from full‐text articles. Any disagreements on eligibility and inclusion were resolved by consensus. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. The primary outcomes were: incidence of delirium; inpatient and later mortality; and new diagnosis of dementia. We included secondary and adverse outcomes as pre‐specified in the review protocol. We used risk ratios (RRs) as measures of treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes and between‐group mean differences for continuous outcomes. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. A complementary exploratory analysis was undertaker using a Bayesian component network meta‐analysis fixed‐effect model to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the individual components of multicomponent interventions and describe which components were most strongly associated with reducing the incidence of delirium. 
Main results
We included 22 RCTs that recruited a total of 5718 adult participants. Fourteen trials compared a multicomponent delirium prevention intervention with usual care. Two trials compared liberal and restrictive blood transfusion thresholds. The remaining six trials each investigated a different non‐pharmacological intervention. Incidence of delirium was reported in all studies.  
Using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, we identified risks of bias in all included trials. All were at high risk of performance bias as participants and personnel were not blinded to the interventions. Nine trials were at high risk of detection bias due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors and three more were at unclear risk in this domain.  
Pooled data showed that multi‐component non‐pharmacological interventions probably reduce the incidence of delirium compared to usual care (10.5% incidence in the intervention group, compared to 18.4% in the control group, risk ratio (RR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.71, I2 = 39%; 14 studies; 3693 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence, downgraded due to risk of bias).  
There may be little or no effect of multicomponent interventions on inpatient mortality compared to usual care (5.2% in the intervention group, compared to 4.5% in the control group, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.74, I2 = 15%; 10 studies; 2640 participants; low‐certainty evidence downgraded due to inconsistency and imprecision).  
No studies of multicomponent interventions reported data on new diagnoses of dementia. 
Multicomponent interventions may result in a small reduction of around a day in the duration of a delirium episode (mean difference (MD) ‐0.93, 95% CI ‐2.01 to 0.14 days, I2 = 65%; 351 participants; low‐certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of multicomponent interventions on delirium severity (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.49, 95% CI ‐1.13 to 0.14, I2=64%; 147 participants; very low‐certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and serious imprecision). Multicomponent interventions may result in a reduction in hospital length of stay compared to usual care (MD ‐1.30 days, 95% CI ‐2.56 to ‐0.04 days, I2=91%; 3351 participants; low‐certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and inconsistency), but little to no difference in new care home admission at the time of hospital discharge (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.07; 536 participants; low‐certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision). Reporting of other adverse outcomes was limited.  
Our exploratory component network meta‐analysis found that re‐orientation (including use of familiar objects), cognitive stimulation and sleep hygiene were associated with reduced risk of incident delirium. Attention to nutrition and hydration, oxygenation, medication review, assessment of mood and bowel and bladder care were probably associated with a reduction in incident delirium but estimates included the possibility of no benefit or harm.  Reducing sensory deprivation, identification of infection, mobilisation and pain control all had summary estimates that suggested potential increases in delirium incidence, but the uncertainty in the estimates was substantial.  
Evidence from two trials suggests that use of a liberal transfusion threshold over a restrictive transfusion threshold probably results in little to no difference in incident delirium (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.36; I2 = 9%; 294 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias).  
Six other interventions were examined, but evidence for each was limited to single studies and we identified no evidence of delirium prevention.  
Authors' conclusions
There is moderate‐certainty evidence regarding the benefit of multicomponent non‐pharmacological interventions for the prevention of delirium in hospitalised adults, estimated to reduce incidence by 43% compared to usual care. We found no evidence of an effect on mortality. There is emerging evidence that these interventions may reduce hospital length of stay, with a trend towards reduced delirium duration, although the effect on delirium severity remains uncertain. Further research should focus on implementation and detailed analysis of the components of the interventions to support more effective, tailored practice recommendations.

### **Plain Title**

Can care without medicine help stop confusion for people in the hospital?

### **Rationale**

Some people get a condition called delirium when they are in the hospital. Delirium is a state of sudden confusion. It can make people feel scared and upset. It can also cause other health problems.

There are not many good medicines to treat delirium once it starts. Because of this, doctors and nurses think it is very important to try to stop delirium from happening at all.

This study looked at ways to prevent delirium that do not use medicine. These treatments are simple things that hospital staff can do to help patients. Researchers wanted to know if these treatments could help lower the number of people who get delirium in the hospital.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of 22 studies that were already done. Looking at many studies together can give a stronger answer.

The studies they looked at were a special type called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, people are put into groups by chance. One group gets special care to prevent delirium. The other group gets the normal care that everyone gets in the hospital.

The review included over 5,700 adults who were in the hospital. These patients were not in the intensive care unit, or ICU, which is for the sickest patients. The studies compared people who got the special care with people who got the usual hospital care.

### **Results**

The researchers found that care without medicine can help prevent delirium.

In the studies, about 18 out of every 100 people who got usual care got delirium. But only about 10 out of every 100 people who got the special treatments got delirium. This means the special care cut the risk of getting delirium by almost half.

The special care was a mix of many things done at once. These included:
*   Helping patients know where they were and what time it was.
*   Giving patients mind exercises, like puzzles.
*   Making sure patients could see and hear well, with glasses or hearing aids.
*   Helping patients get a good night's sleep.
*   Encouraging patients to move around as much as possible.

The researchers also looked at other things. The special care did not seem to change the number of people who died in the hospital. But, people who got the special treatments were able to go home from the hospital about one day sooner.

The researchers concluded that using a mix of treatments without medicine is a good way to prevent delirium for adults in the hospital. They believe more work is needed to find out which parts of the special care are the most helpful for patients.","Non‐drug approaches for preventing delirium in adults receiving care in hospital outside of intensive care and high dependency units 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for non‐pharmacological (non‐medication‐based) approaches to prevent delirium in adults in hospital, not including those treated in intensive care units (ICU, specialised wards for the care of critically ill patients). 
Background 
Delirium is an important illness which is common among adults, especially older adults who are in hospital. It is sometimes referred to as an 'acute confusional state'. Typically, a person with delirium has sudden onset of confusion, which fluctuates, and often includes impaired concentration, memory and thinking skills; reduced awareness of surroundings; drowsiness or agitation and restlessness; and hallucinations, which are usually visual (seeing things which are not really there). It can be distressing for the individual with delirium and their family. It is also associated with increased risks of complications, such as dying in hospital, having a longer hospital stay, and requiring more care after discharge. Increasingly, there is evidence that delirium is associated with an increased risk of permanent worsening of memory and thinking skills, including development or worsening of dementia.  
Non‐pharmacological approaches are approaches which do not use medications, but which focus on other aspects of care. They are already recognised as important in reducing the risk of delirium, particularly multicomponent interventions which target several of the common risk factors for delirium. It is not known which components of these complex interventions are most important in preventing delirium and this was something we wanted to find out.  
Study characteristics 
We searched up to 16 September 2020 for reports of studies in which people in hospital were randomly allocated to a non‐pharmacological intervention intended to prevent delirium or to usual hospital care.  We found 22 studies with 5718 participants. Fourteen of the studies were of multicomponent approaches; two studies looked at different cut‐offs for giving a blood transfusion after an orthopaedic operation; the remaining six studies all considered different approaches. 
Key findings 
Multicomponent approaches probably reduce occurrence of delirium by 43% compared to usual hospital care. This means that two in five cases of delirium in adults in hospital wards (other than ICU) can be prevented by multicomponent, non‐pharmacological approaches. These interventions may also reduce the length of time people stay in hospital and, if delirium does occur, they may reduce the duration of the delirium episode by about a day. However, these approaches may have little or no effect on the risk of dying in hospital. The studies did not investigate the effect of multicomponent interventions on the development or worsening of dementia. There was little information about whether the interventions had any harmful effects.  
Using a new statistical technique, we found  that the following components within each intervention were most important for preventing delirium:  (a) trying to keep people well‐oriented to their surroundings and making their surroundings more familiar, (b) providing stimulation to memory and thinking skills, and (c) trying to improve sleep (through sleep hygiene measures). We could not be so certain about the effect of other components, largely because not enough evidence was available. More research is needed comparing the specific components included in multicomponent interventions to help determine the most effective and efficient ways to prevent delirium.  
The evidence for other, single‐component, non‐pharmacological interventions was very limited.  
Certainty of the evidence 
There were some limitations in the studies which may affect the results. In many included studies the people in the study and sometimes researchers were aware of who was and was not receiving the intervention.  
There was very little information about people living with dementia, who are at greater risk of experiencing delirium.

Funding to support researchers to undertake this review was received from the National Institute for Health Research (Incentive Award 130725) and Medical Research Scotland (Vacation Scholarship).

Plasmodium vivax (P vivax) is a focus of malaria elimination. It is important because P vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection are co‐endemic in some areas. There are asymptomatic carriers of P vivax, and the treatment for P vivax and Plasmodium ovale malaria differs from that used in other types of malaria. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) will help distinguish P vivax from other malaria species to help treatment and elimination. There are RDTs available that detect P vivax parasitaemia through the detection of P vivax‐specific lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) antigens. 
Objectives
To assess the diagnostic accuracy of RDTs for detecting P vivax malaria infection in people living in malaria‐endemic areas who present to ambulatory healthcare facilities with symptoms suggestive of malaria; and to identify which types and brands of commercial tests best detect P vivax malaria. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases up to 30 July 2019: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase (OVID); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI‐EXPANDED) and Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science (CPCI‐S), both in the Web of Science. 
Selection criteria
Studies comparing RDTs with a reference standard (microscopy or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) in blood samples from patients attending ambulatory health facilities with symptoms suggestive of malaria in P vivax‐endemic areas. 
Data collection and analysis
For each included study, two review authors independently extracted data using a pre‐piloted data extraction form. The methodological quality of the studies were assessed using a tailored Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies‐2 (QUADAS‐2) tool. We grouped studies according to commercial brand of the RDT and performed meta‐analysis when appropriate. The results given by the index tests were based on the antibody affinity (referred to as the strength of the bond between an antibody and an antigen) and avidity (referred to as the strength of the overall bond between a multivalent antibody and multiple antigens). All analyses were stratified by the type of reference standard. The bivariate model was used to estimate the pooled sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), this model was simplified when studies were few. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included 10 studies that assessed the accuracy of six different RDT brands (CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test, Falcivax Device Rapid test, Immuno‐Rapid Malaria Pf/Pv test, SD Bioline Malaria Ag Pf/Pv test, OnSite Pf/Pv test and Test Malaria Pf/Pv rapid test) for detecting P vivax malaria. One study directly compared the accuracy of two RDT brands. Of the 10 studies, six used microscopy, one used PCR, two used both microscopy and PCR separately and one used microscopy corrected by PCR as the reference standard. Four of the studies were conducted in Ethiopia, two in India, and one each in Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia and Sudan. 
The studies often did not report how patients were selected. In the patient selection domain, we judged the risk of bias as unclear for nine studies. We judged all studies to be of unclear applicability concern. In the index test domain, we judged most studies to be at low risk of bias, but we judged nine studies to be of unclear applicability concern. There was poor reporting on lot testing, how the RDTs were stored, and background parasitaemia density (a key variable determining diagnostic accuracy of RDTs). Only half of the included studies were judged to be at low risk of bias in the reference standard domain, Studies often did not report whether the results of the reference standard could classify the target condition or whether investigators knew the results of the RDT when interpreting the results of the reference standard. All 10 studies were judged to be at low risk of bias in the flow and timing domain. 
Only two brands were evaluated by more than one study. Four studies evaluated the CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test against microscopy and two studies evaluated the Falcivax Device Rapid test against microscopy. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 99% (95% CI 94% to 100%; 251 patients, moderate‐certainty evidence) and 99% (95% CI 99% to 100%; 2147 patients, moderate‐certainty evidence) for CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test. 
For a prevalence of 20%, about 206 people will have a positive CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test result and the remaining 794 people will have a negative result. Of the 206 people with positive results, eight will be incorrect (false positives), and of the 794 people with a negative result, two would be incorrect (false negative). 
For the Falcivax Device Rapid test, the pooled sensitivity was 77% (95% CI: 53% to 91%, 89 patients, low‐certainty evidence) and the pooled specificity was 99% (95% CI: 98% to 100%, 621 patients, moderate‐certainty evidence), respectively. For a prevalence of 20%, about 162 people will have a positive Falcivax Device Rapid test result and the remaining 838 people will have a negative result. Of the 162 people with positive results, eight will be incorrect (false positives), and of the 838 people with a negative result, 46 would be incorrect (false negative). 
Authors' conclusions
The CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test was found to be highly sensitive and specific in comparison to microscopy for detecting P vivax in ambulatory healthcare in endemic settings, with moderate‐certainty evidence. The number of studies included in this review was limited to 10 studies and we were able to estimate the accuracy of 2 out of 6 RDT brands included, the CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test and the Falcivax Device Rapid test. Thus, the differences in sensitivity and specificity between all the RDT brands could not be assessed. More high‐quality studies in endemic field settings are needed to assess and compare the accuracy of RDTs designed to detect P vivax.

Testing the Quick Tests for a Type of Malaria called P. vivax

### **Rationale**

Malaria is a serious sickness spread by mosquito bites. There are different types of malaria. One type is called *Plasmodium vivax*, or P. vivax for short. This type of malaria is a problem in many parts of the world. To get rid of malaria completely, we must be able to treat the P. vivax type.

Some people can have P. vivax malaria but not feel sick. They can still spread it to others. Also, the medicine for P. vivax is different from the medicine for other types of malaria. So, it is very important for doctors to know exactly which type of malaria a person has.

Quick blood tests can help. These are called rapid diagnostic tests, or RDTs. They can give results in a few minutes. These tests can help doctors find out if a person has P. vivax malaria. This helps them choose the right medicine right away. This study was done to see how well these quick tests work. The researchers wanted to find out which brands of tests are the best at finding P. vivax malaria.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked for all the past studies that had already been done on this topic. They gathered the information from these studies to get a bigger picture of how well the tests work. This is called a review.

The researchers looked for studies that included people who lived in areas where malaria is common. The people in these studies went to a clinic with symptoms of malaria, like a fever. The studies compared the results from a quick test to the results from a standard test. The standard tests were either looking at the person’s blood under a microscope or a lab test called a PCR test.

The researchers found 10 studies to include in their review. These studies looked at 6 different brands of quick tests. The studies took place in several countries, including Ethiopia, India, Brazil, and Sudan.

### **Results**

The researchers found that the quality of the 10 studies was not always clear. Many studies did not share all the details about how they were done. This made it hard for the researchers to be completely sure about the results.

There was enough information to look closely at two of the six test brands.

The first test was the **CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test**.
*   This test was very good at finding people who had P. vivax malaria. If 100 people had this malaria, the test correctly found 99 of them.
*   This test was also very good at finding people who did not have P. vivax malaria. If 100 people did not have this malaria, the test correctly found 99 of them.
*   This means the test gives very few wrong results. The researchers were fairly certain about these findings.

The second test was the **Falcivax Device Rapid test**.
*   This test was not as good at finding people who had P. vivax malaria. If 100 people had this malaria, the test only found 77 of them. It missed 23 people who were sick.
*   This test was very good at finding people who did not have P. vivax malaria. If 100 people did not have this malaria, the test correctly found 99 of them.
*   The researchers were not very certain about how well this test finds malaria. But they were more certain that it works well for people who are not sick.

Based on this review, the CareStart test works much better than the Falcivax test. The researchers concluded that the CareStart test is a very good tool for doctors to use in places where P. vivax malaria is common. However, because they only had enough information to check two of the six tests, more good studies are needed. More studies will help us compare all the different brands of quick tests and find the best ones to help fight malaria.","Rapid tests for diagnosing malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax in people living in areas where malaria is very common 
What is the aim of the review? 
Malaria infection is caused mainly by two species of malaria parasite: Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. The aim of this review was to evaluate rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to diagnose P vivax infection. 
Why are rapid tests for P vivax malaria important? 
For clinical management, knowing which parasite species is causing the malaria is important as the drug treatments differ. For P vivax infection, an additional drug is required to eliminate the infection from the liver. For public health control of malaria, we know that P falciparum is declining over the previous 15 years, and infections from P vivax have therefore increased in importance. 
What was studied in this review? 
RDTs provide results quickly and are often as a dipstick. We studied RDTs that specifically test for P vivax malaria. RDTs are simple to use, point‐of‐care tests. They are suitable for use in rural settings by primary healthcare workers, using drop of blood on the dipstick that causes colour change and a distinct line that indicates a positive test result. Healthcare workers in rural areas can perform RDTs for P vivax without needing a laboratory or special equipment. We wanted to find out which brands of RDTs were the most accurate for diagnosing P vivax malaria. We compared the new tests against the standard form of diagnosis with microscopy, and also more recent methods polymerase chain reaction (PCR): a molecular method to identify P vivax DNA in blood samples. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We included 10 studies that looked at the accuracy of six diagnostic test brands for detecting P vivax malaria in people with suspected malaria symptoms. The studies were conducted in Ethiopia (four studies), India (two studies) and Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, and Sudan (one study each). 
Compared with microscopy, the Care Start Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test performed well with 99% sensitivity and specificity (four studies). This means that: 
• for every 100 people tested who have P vivax malaria, one person will have a negative test result, and might not receive the right treatment soon enough; 
• for every 100 people tested who do not have P vivax malaria, one will have a positive result, and might receive unnecessary treatment. 
Compared with microscopy, the Falcivax Device Rapid test had a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 99% (two studies). This means that: 
• For every 100 people tested who have P vivax malaria, 23 people will have a negative test result; and, 
• for every 100 people tested who do not have P vivax malaria, one person will have a positive result. 
We are moderately confident (certain) in the accuracy results for the Care Start Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test. The results are from a small number of studies (four), so our findings may change when results from further studies become available. 
We are less confident in the accuracy results for the Falcivax Device Rapid test, because these came from only two studies. Our findings for this test will probably change when results from further studies become available. 
Our results are based on a small number of studies, so we could not reliably assess all six brands of antibody test or compare their accuracy. Most studies included in this review had limitations: it was not clear how people were selected for testing, or how the study results were assessed and checked, which could have affected the results. Some rapid antibody tests were investigated by only one study. Some studies did not report clearly how common P malaria was in the area where the study was done. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for studies published up to 30 July 2019.

People with dementia in nursing homes often experience pain, but often do not receive adequate pain therapy. The experience of pain has a significant impact on quality of life in people with dementia, and is associated with negative health outcomes. Untreated pain is also considered to be one of the causes of challenging behaviour, such as agitation or aggression, in this population. One approach to reducing pain in people with dementia in nursing homes is an algorithm‐based pain management strategy, i.e. the use of a structured protocol that involves pain assessment and a series of predefined treatment steps consisting of various non‐pharmacological and pharmacological pain management interventions. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of algorithm‐based pain management interventions to reduce pain and challenging behaviour in people with dementia living in nursing homes. 
To describe the components of the interventions and the content of the algorithms.
Search methods
We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization's meta‐register the International Clinical Trials Registry Portal on 30 June 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials investigating the effects of algorithm‐based pain management interventions for people with dementia living in nursing homes. All interventions had to include an initial pain assessment, a treatment algorithm (a treatment plan consisting of at least two different non‐pharmacological or pharmacological treatment steps to reduce pain), and criteria to assess the success of each treatment step. The control groups could receive usual care or an active control intervention. Primary outcomes for this review were pain‐related outcomes, e.g. the number of participants with pain (self‐ or proxy‐rated), challenging behaviour (we used a broad definition that could also include agitation or behavioural and psychological symptoms assessed with any validated instrument), and serious adverse events. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected the articles for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of all included studies. We reported results narratively as there were too few studies for a meta‐analysis. We used GRADE methods to rate the certainty of the results. 
Main results
We included three cluster‐randomised controlled trials with a total of 808 participants (mean age 82 to 89 years). In two studies, participants had severe cognitive impairment and in one study mild to moderate impairment. The algorithms used in the studies varied in the number of treatment steps. The comparator was pain education for nursing staff in two studies and usual care in one study. 
We judged the risk of detection bias to be high in one study. The risk of selection bias and performance bias was unclear in all studies. 
Self‐rated pain (i.e. pain rated by participants themselves) was reported in two studies. In one study, all residents in the nursing homes were included, but fewer than half of the participants experienced pain at baseline, and the mean values of self‐rated and proxy‐rated pain at baseline and follow‐up in both study groups were below the threshold of pain that may require treatment. We considered the evidence from this study to be very low‐certainty and therefore are uncertain whether the algorithm‐based pain management intervention had an effect on self‐rated pain intensity compared with pain education (MD ‐0.27, 95% CI ‐0.49 to ‐0.05, 170 participants; Verbal Descriptor Scale, range 0 to 3). In the other study, all participants had mild to moderate pain at baseline. Here, we found low‐certainty evidence that an algorithm‐based pain management intervention may have little to no effect on self‐rated pain intensity compared with pain education (MD 0.4, 95% CI ‐0.58 to 1.38, 246 participants; Iowa Pain Thermometer, range 0 to 12). 
Pain was rated by proxy in all three studies. Again, we considered the evidence from the study in which mean pain scores indicated no pain, or almost no pain, at baseline to be very low‐certainty and were uncertain whether the algorithm‐based pain management intervention had an effect on proxy‐rated pain intensity compared with pain education. For participants with mild to moderate pain at baseline, we found low‐certainty evidence that an algorithm‐based pain management intervention may reduce proxy‐rated pain intensity in comparison with usual care (MD ‐1.49, 95% CI ‐2.11 to ‐0.87, 1 study, 128 participants; Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia Scale‐Chinese version, range 0 to 10), but may not be more effective than pain education (MD ‐0.2, 95% CI ‐0.79 to 0.39, 1 study, 383 participants; Iowa Pain Thermometer, range 0 to 12). 
For challenging behaviour, we found very low‐certainty evidence from one study in which mean pain scores indicated no pain, or almost no pain, at baseline. We were uncertain whether the algorithm‐based pain management intervention had any more effect than education for nursing staff on challenging behaviour of participants (MD ‐0.21, 95% CI ‐1.88 to 1.46, 1 study, 170 participants; Cohen‐Mansfield Agitation Inventory‐Chinese version, range 7 to 203). 
None of the studies systematically assessed adverse effects or serious adverse effects and no study reported information about the occurrence of any adverse effect. None of the studies assessed any of the other outcomes of this review. 
Authors' conclusions
There is no clear evidence for a benefit of an algorithm‐based pain management intervention in comparison with pain education for reducing pain intensity or challenging behaviour in people with dementia in nursing homes. We found that the intervention may reduce proxy‐rated pain compared with usual care. However, the certainty of evidence is low because of the small number of studies, small sample sizes, methodological limitations, and the clinical heterogeneity of the study populations (e.g. pain level and cognitive status). The results should be interpreted with caution. Future studies should also focus on the implementation of algorithms and their impact in clinical practice.

Does a Step-by-Step Plan Help Manage Pain for People with Dementia in Nursing Homes?

**Rationale**

People with dementia who live in nursing homes often have pain. This pain is not always treated well. When pain is not treated, it can make a person’s life harder. It can also cause them to feel upset, restless, or angry. This is sometimes called ""challenging behavior.""

Researchers wanted to find a better way to manage pain for these individuals. One idea is to use a step-by-step plan. This plan helps nurses check for pain in a structured way. If they find pain, the plan gives them clear steps to treat it. These steps can include comfort care without medicine, as well as pain medicine.

This review looked at past studies to see if these step-by-step plans work. The main goal was to find out if the plans could reduce pain and challenging behaviors for people with dementia.

**Trial Design**

This was a review of other studies. The researchers looked for the best studies they could find on this topic. They found 3 good studies to include.

A total of 808 people took part in these 3 studies. The people in the studies were, on average, between 82 and 89 years old. They all lived in nursing homes and had dementia, which affects a person’s memory and thinking.

In each study, nursing homes were split into at least two groups.
*   One group of nursing homes used the step-by-step pain management plan.
*   The other group was a comparison group. In one study, this group received the usual care they always got. In the other two studies, the nurses in the comparison group got extra education about pain, but did not use the step-by-step plan.

**Results**

The results of this review were not clear. The proof for the benefits of the step-by-step plan was weak.

*   **Pain reported by the person with dementia:** The step-by-step plan did not seem to reduce the amount of pain that people reported themselves.
*   **Pain reported by caregivers:** Sometimes, a nurse or caregiver rated how much pain they thought the person was in. The step-by-step plan *might* have helped reduce this type of pain when compared to usual care. However, the plan did not seem to work any better than just giving nurses extra training on pain.
*   **Challenging behaviors:** The review found no clear proof that the step-by-step plan helped reduce behaviors like being upset or angry. The researchers are uncertain if the plan had any effect on this.
*   **Side effects:** The studies did not report on any side effects from the treatments. Because of this, we do not know if the step-by-step plan caused any other problems for the people in the studies.

In conclusion, the researchers who wrote this review found no strong proof that a step-by-step pain plan works better than giving nurses extra pain education. The plan might be a little better than usual care. But because there were only a few small studies, more research is needed to be sure. The researchers say we should be careful when looking at these results.","Step‐by‐step (algorithm‐based) pain management for people with dementia living in nursing homes 
What is the aim of this review? 
We were interested in how nurses can best manage pain in people with dementia living in nursing homes. Pain management involves measuring pain and providing pain treatment if necessary. We aimed to find out whether step‐by‐step guidance (an algorithm) for nurses on how to manage pain can reduce pain or behaviours that may indicate someone is in distress (such as hitting, shouting or wandering). 
What was studied in the review? 
People with dementia in nursing homes often experience pain. However, they cannot always tell their caregivers if they are in pain, so it can be difficult to recognise, and we know that nursing home residents with dementia receive less pain medication than those without dementia. Untreated pain can have a negative impact on well‐being and health, and can also be one reason for challenging behaviour, such as aggression. The use of detailed step‐by‐step guidance for nursing staff, in this review called an algorithm, is designed to improve pain management. Algorithms start with a structured pain assessment and then set out different treatment steps, which can be non‐medication or medication treatments for reducing pain. If pain is detected, the treatment described in the first step is applied. If this treatment does not reduce pain, the treatment from the next step is applied, and so on. 
Studies included in the review 
In June 2021 we searched for trials that investigated pain management based on the use of an algorithm. We found three studies including 808 participants. Two of these studies compared algorithm‐based pain management with education for the nursing staff on pain and dementia, and one study compared algorithm‐based pain management with usual care. 
The level of pain and the severity of the participants' dementia differed in the three studies. One study included all the residents in the nursing homes, most of whom had no pain, or almost no pain, at the start of the study (fewer than half of the included people experienced pain), and two studies included only people with mild to moderate pain. In one study the participants' dementia was of mild or moderate severity and in two studies the participants had severe dementia. 
In two studies, those people with dementia who were able to do so reported on their own pain and the nursing staff also judged whether the participants showed signs of pain. In the third study, pain was rated by members of the research team, but not by the participants themselves. The nurses and the researchers used observations of things like facial expressions, gestures and breathing to judge whether someone was in pain. 
What are the key findings? 
When we looked at the study in which people started out on average with no pain, or almost no pain, we could not be certain whether algorithm‐based pain management had an effect on the intensity of pain they experienced during the study. This was true whether the study participants reported on their own pain or whether nurses judged pain intensity. We also could not tell from this study whether algorithm‐based pain management reduced challenging behaviour. 
For people who started out with mild to moderate pain, we found that, compared to education for nursing staff, algorithm‐based pain management may have little or no effect on pain intensity reported by the people themselves (based on the results from one study). When the pain was rated by somebody else (a 'proxy', who was a nurse or research assistant), we found that algorithm‐based pain management may be better than usual care, although it may not be more effective than pain education. However, it is difficult to be sure about the accuracy of pain ratings made by other people. 
Our confidence in the results was limited because of the small number of included studies, the variation in the intensity of pain and in the severity of the participants' dementia at the start of the trials, and the quality of the studies. 
No study looked for harmful effects, and no study described that any harmful effects occurred. 
What is the conclusion? 
We found no good evidence that introducing an algorithm to guide pain management for people with dementia in nursing homes is any better than education for nursing staff for reducing pain or challenging behaviours, but it may be better than usual care at reducing pain (rated by observers). The amount of evidence was small, and we could not be certain of the results. More research in this area would be valuable.

10.1002-14651858.CD013240.pub2,"Background
Endometriosis is known to have an impact on fertility and it is common for women affected by endometriosis to require fertility treatments, including in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), to improve the chance of pregnancy. It has been postulated that long‐term gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy prior to IVF or ICSI can improve pregnancy outcomes. This systematic review supersedes the previous Cochrane Review on this topic (Sallam 2006). 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of long‐term gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy (minimum 3 months) versus no pretreatment or other pretreatment modalities, such as long‐term continuous combined oral contraception (COC) or surgical therapy of endometrioma, before standard in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in women with endometriosis. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases from their inception to 8 January 2019: Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, CENTRAL via the Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Studies ONLINE (CRSO), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). We searched trial registries to identify unpublished and ongoing trials. We also searched DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects), Web of Knowledge, OpenGrey, Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database (LILACS), PubMed, Google and reference lists from relevant papers for any other relevant trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving women with surgically diagnosed endometriosis that compared use of any type of GnRH agonist for at least three months before an IVF/ICSI protocol to no pretreatment or other pretreatment modalities, specifically use of long‐term continuous COC (minimum of 6 weeks) or surgical excision of endometrioma within six months prior to standard IVF/ICSI. The primary outcomes were live birth rate and complication rate per woman randomised. 
Data collection and analysis
Two independent review authors assessed studies against the inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A third review author was consulted, if required. We contacted the study authors, as required. We analysed dichotomous outcomes using Mantel‐Haenszel risk ratios (RRs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and a fixed‐effect model. For small numbers of events, we used a Peto odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI instead. We analysed continuous outcomes using the mean difference (MD) between groups and presented with 95% CIs. We studied heterogeneity of the studies via the I2 statistic. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE criteria. 
Main results
We included eight parallel‐design RCTs, involving a total of 640 participants. We did not assess any of the studies as being at low risk of bias across all domains, with the main limitation being lack of blinding. Using GRADE methodology, the quality of the evidence ranged from very low to low quality. 
Long‐term GnRH agonist therapy versus no pretreatment 
We are uncertain whether long‐term GnRH agonist therapy affects the live birth rate (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.87; 1 RCT, n = 147; I2 not calculable; very low‐quality evidence) or the overall complication rate (Peto OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.37; to 4.14; 3 RCTs, n = 318; I2 = 73%; very low‐quality evidence) compared to standard IVF/ICSI. Further, we are uncertain whether this intervention affects the clinical pregnancy rate (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.41; 6 RCTs, n = 552, I2 = 66%; very low‐quality evidence), multiple pregnancy rate (Peto OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.56; 2 RCTs, n = 208, I2 = 0%; very low‐quality evidence), miscarriage rate (Peto OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.00; 2 RCTs, n = 208; I2 = 0%; very low‐quality evidence), mean number of oocytes (MD 0.72, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.38; 4 RCTs, n = 385; I2 = 81%; very low‐quality evidence) or mean number of embryos (MD ‐0.76, 95% CI ‐1.33 to ‐0.19; 2 RCTs, n = 267; I2 = 0%; very low‐quality evidence). 
Long‐term GnRH agonist therapy versus long‐term continuous COC 
No studies reported on this comparison.
Long‐term GnRH agonist therapy versus surgical therapy of endometrioma 
No studies reported on this comparison.
Authors' conclusions
This review raises important questions regarding the merit of long‐term GnRH agonist therapy compared to no pretreatment prior to standard IVF/ICSI in women with endometriosis. Contrary to previous findings, we are uncertain as to whether long‐term GnRH agonist therapy impacts on the live birth rate or indeed the complication rate compared to standard IVF/ICSI. Further, we are uncertain whether this intervention impacts on the clinical pregnancy rate, multiple pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, mean number of oocytes and mean number of embryos. In light of the paucity and very low quality of existing data, particularly for the primary outcomes examined, further high‐quality trials are required to definitively determine the impact of long‐term GnRH agonist therapy on IVF/ICSI outcomes, not only compared to no pretreatment, but also compared to other proposed alternatives to endometriosis management.

Does a Long-Term Hormone Drug Before Fertility Treatment Help Women with Endometriosis Have a Baby? A Review of Studies

### **Rationale**

**What is endometriosis?**
Endometriosis is a health problem that affects women. It happens when tissue that is like the lining of the womb grows in other places in the body. This can cause pain. It can also make it very hard for a woman to get pregnant.

Many women with endometriosis need help to have a baby. They may use fertility treatments. One type of treatment is called IVF. IVF is when doctors take eggs from a woman and mix them with sperm in a lab to make a baby.

**Why did researchers do this study?**
Some doctors believe that a certain drug may help women with endometriosis get pregnant with IVF. This drug is a type of hormone treatment. Women would take this drug for at least 3 months *before* starting their IVF treatment. The idea was that this drug could improve the chance of having a baby.

Researchers wanted to know if this was true. They looked at all the past studies on this topic. They wanted to bring all the information together. This would help them see if the drug really works and if it is safe for women.

### **Trial Design**

**How did the researchers look for an answer?**
This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, the researchers did a review. They searched for and looked at studies that were already done. This helps get a bigger and clearer picture.

They looked at 8 studies. A total of 640 women with endometriosis took part in these studies.

In these studies, women were put into different groups by chance.
*   One group of women took the hormone drug for 3 months or more before their IVF treatment.
*   Another group of women had their IVF treatment with no drug treatment beforehand.

The researchers wanted to compare the two groups. They wanted to see which group had a better chance of having a baby. They also looked for any health problems or side effects.

### **Results**

**What did the researchers find?**
After looking at all the studies, the researchers were not sure if the hormone drug helps. The studies they found were not of very good quality. This means the results were not very clear or certain.

Here is what the researchers could not tell for sure:
*   **Having a baby:** They were not sure if taking the drug before IVF treatment helped more women have a baby.
*   **Health problems:** They were not sure if the drug caused more or fewer health problems.
*   **Getting pregnant:** They were not sure if the drug helped more women get pregnant.
*   **Miscarriage:** They were not sure if the drug changed the chance of having a miscarriage.

The researchers also looked at the number of eggs that were collected from the women. They also looked at the number of early babies, called embryos, that were made in the lab. They were not sure if the drug changed these numbers either.

**What does this mean?**
The researchers concluded that we do not have enough good information. We cannot say for sure that taking this long-term hormone drug before IVF is helpful.

This review shows that we need more and better studies. Future studies should be larger and well-designed. These new studies will help us get a clear answer. Then, women with endometriosis and their doctors can make the best choices about their fertility treatment.","Long‐term pituitary down‐regulation before in vitro fertilisation (IVF) for women with endometriosis 
Review question 
We reviewed the efficacy and safety of treating women with known endometriosis (a disease characterised by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the cavity of the womb) with gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist medication for a period of three to six months prior to in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). We aimed to compare this intervention to no treatment prior to IVF/ICSI, pretreatment with long‐term continuous combined oral contraception (COC) or surgical treatment to remove endometriomas (cysts forming in the ovaries as a consequence of endometriosis). 
Background 
Many women affected by endometriosis suffer with infertility and may, as a result, seek IVF/ICSI treatment. IVF/ICSI is known to be less successful in women with endometriosis and a variety of interventions prior to IVF/ICSI have been proposed to try and improve outcomes. These include long‐term GnRH agonist therapy, long‐term continuous COC therapy or surgery to remove endometriomas. 
Study characteristics 
We found eight randomised controlled trials comparing long‐term GnRH agonist therapy with no pretreatment including a total of 640 women with endometriosis prior to IVF/ICSI. The evidence is current to January 2019. 
Key results 
Compared to no pretreatment, we are uncertain whether long‐term GnRH agonist therapy prior to IVF/ICSI in women with endometriosis affects the live birth rate. The evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth rate is assumed to be 36% with no pretreatment, the chance following long‐term GnRH agonist therapy would be between 9% and 31%. We are also uncertain whether this intervention affects complication rate, clinical pregnancy rate, multiple pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, mean number of oocytes and mean number of embryos. No studies compared long‐term GnRH agonist therapy to long‐term continuous COC therapy or surgery to remove endometriomas. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of very low quality. The main limitations in the evidence were lack of blinding (the process where the women participating in the trial, as well as the research staff, are not aware of the intervention used), inconsistency (differences between different studies) and imprecision (random error and small size of each study). 
"
10.1002-14651858.CD013376.pub2,"Background
Aflatoxins are carcinogenic mycotoxins that contaminate many food crops. Maize and groundnuts are prone to aflatoxin contamination, and are the major sources of human exposure to aflatoxins, due to their high intake as staple foods, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs). Observational studies suggest an association between dietary exposure to aflatoxins during pregnancy and early childhood and linear growth in infants and young children. 
Objectives
To assess the effects on pre‐ and postnatal growth outcomes when agricultural and nutritional education interventions during the post‐harvest period that aim to reduce aflatoxin exposure are compared to usual support or no intervention. We assessed this in infants, children, and pregnant and lactating women at the household or community level in LMICs. 
Search methods
In July and August 2019, we searched: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science Core Collection, Africa‐Wide, LILACS, CAB Abstracts, Agricola, and two trials registers. We also checked the bibliographies of the included studies and contacted relevant mycotoxin organisations and researchers for additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster‐RCTs of agricultural education and nutritional education interventions of any duration, at the household or community level, aimed at reducing aflatoxin intake by infants, children, and pregnant and lactating women, in LMICs during the post‐harvest period, compared to no intervention or usual support. We excluded studies that followed participants for less than four weeks. We assessed prespecified prenatal (at birth) and postnatal growth outcomes (during infancy, childhood, and adolescence), with linear growth (as the primary outcome), infectious disease morbidity, and unintended consequences. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed study eligibility using prespecified criteria, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias of included RCTs. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE, and presented the main results in a 'Summary of findings' table. 
Main results
We included three recent cluster‐RCTs reporting the effects of agricultural education plus post‐harvest technologies, compared to usual agricultural support or no intervention. The participants were pregnant women and their children, lactating women and their infants (< 6 months), women of childbearing age, and young children (< 59 months), from rural, subsistence maize‐farming communities in Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania. 
Two trials randomised villages to the intervention and control groups, including a total of at least 979 mother‐child pairs from 60 villages. The third trial randomised 420 households, including 189 mother‐child pairs and 231 women of childbearing age. Duration of the intervention and follow‐up ranged between five and nine months. Due to risk of attrition bias, the overall risk of bias was unclear in one trial, and high in the other two trials. 
None of the included studies addressed the effects of nutritional education on pre‐ and postnatal growth. 
One trial reported outcomes not prespecified in our review, and we were unable to obtain unpublished growth data from the second trial, even after contacting the authors. The third trial, in lactating women and their infants in Tanzania, reported on the infants' weight‐for‐age z‐score (WAZ) after six months. This trial found that providing agricultural education aimed at changing farmers' post‐harvest practices to reduce aflatoxin exposure, by using demonstrations (e.g. handsorting, de‐hulling of maize, drying sheets, and insecticides), may improve WAZ in infants from these farmers' households, on average, by 0.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.98; 1 study; 249 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), compared to infants from households where the farmers received routine agricultural extension services. 
Another way of reporting the effect on WAZ is to compare the proportion of underweight infants (WAZ > 2 SD below the reference median value) per group. This trial found that the intervention may reduce the proportion of underweight infants in the intervention households by 6.7% (95% CI ‐12.6 to ‐1.4; 249 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) compared to control households. 
No studies reported on unintended effects of agricultural and nutritional education.
Authors' conclusions
Evidence on the effects on child growth in LMICs of agricultural or nutritional education interventions that reduce aflatoxin exposure was very limited; no included study reported on linear growth. Very low‐certainty evidence suggested that agricultural education aimed at changing farmers' post‐harvest practices to reduce aflatoxin exposure by using demonstrations, may result in an increase in WAZ, when compared to usual or no education.

Helping Babies Grow: A Study on Food Safety Education for Farmers

### **Rationale**

A type of poison made by mold can grow on food. This poison is called aflatoxin. This mold often grows on foods like corn and peanuts. In some parts of the world, people eat a lot of corn and peanuts as their main food. This means they can eat this poison without knowing it.

This is a special concern for pregnant women and young children. Doctors think this mold poison might stop children from growing well. They believe it might make them shorter and not weigh enough.

This study looked at whether teaching farmers about food safety could help. Researchers wanted to know if this teaching would lower the amount of mold poison in food. The main goal was to see if this would help babies and children grow bigger and healthier.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study. Instead, researchers looked for all the best studies that were already done on this topic. They searched for studies that tried to answer their question. They found three main studies to look at.

The people in these studies were families from farming towns. They lived in the countries of Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania. The studies included pregnant women, new mothers with their babies, and other young children.

In these studies, some whole villages were chosen to get special training. Other villages did not get the training. This helps to compare the results. The training taught farmers better ways to handle their crops after they picked them from the fields. Families were in these studies for about five to nine months.

### **Results**

The researchers found very little information to answer their main question. The main question was whether the training helped children grow taller. None of the studies they found had information about how tall the children grew.

One study in Tanzania did look at how much babies weighed. In this study, farmers learned new ways to handle their corn. They learned to sort it by hand and use special sheets to dry it. This study found that this teaching might have helped babies gain more weight.

The babies in the group that got the teaching had better weight scores. The study also found that fewer babies were underweight in the group that got the teaching. However, the researchers said this proof is not very strong. This means we cannot be sure about these results. More studies are needed to know for sure.

The researchers concluded that there is not enough proof to say that this type of teaching helps children grow. But, one small study showed it might help babies gain a healthy amount of weight. No bad side effects from the teaching were reported in any of the studies.","Reducing aflatoxin intake with agricultural and nutritional education to improve growth of infants and children in low‐ and middle‐income countries 
Review question 
Does providing agricultural and nutritional education about how to reduce the intake of aflatoxins (from contaminated food crops) in households and communities in low and middle‐income countries (LMICs) improve the growth of infants and children compared to usual or no education? 
Background 
Aflatoxins are toxins produced by moulds that contaminate food crops. Maize and groundnuts are the major dietary sources of aflatoxins, as they are eaten in large amounts by many people living in LMICs. Some research from LMICs suggests that there may be a link between aflatoxin intake during pregnancy and early childhood, and growth in infants and young children. 
Study Characteristics 
We included three trials, conducted in pregnant and breastfeeding women (1168 mother‐child pairs), women of childbearing age (N = 231), and infants and young children (< 59 months old), from rural, subsistence maize‐farming communities in Kenya, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. One trial in Tanzania, at unclear risk of bias overall, provided data for this review, since one trial did not report any outcomes relevant to this review, and we were unable to obtain unpublished growth data for another, even after contacting the study authors. 
The trial, conducted in breastfeeding women and their babies, studied the effects of agricultural education (demonstrations to change farmers' practices after harvesting their maize crops to reduce aflatoxins (for example, by handsorting and de‐hulling the maize, using drying sheets and insecticides) on the babies' weight, standardised for age (weight‐for‐age z‐score (WAZ)), after six months (the z‐score measures the difference between these babies and the median of a population of similar babies). Farmers in the control group received routine services from agriculture extension workers. 
Key results 
Very low‐certainty evidence from one trial suggested that the WAZ of 128 children from farmers' households who received agricultural education may improve by a z‐score of 0.57, compared to 121 children from households where farmers only received routine services. This means that a baby girl in the intervention group, with a healthy weight, would gain about 450 to 690 grams more weight between three to nine months, compared to a baby girl in the control group. This is a meaningful difference. 
Another way of measuring the effect is to compare the proportion of underweight infants (WAZ ≥ 2 standard deviations below the reference median value) per group, after the intervention. In this case, agricultural education may reduce the proportion of underweight children, on average, by 6.7% (very low‐certainty evidence), compared to routine services. 
None of the included studies addressed the effects of nutritional education on length of height, or on unintended effects of agricultural or nutritional education. 
Evidence about the effects on child growth of agricultural or nutritional education interventions that reduce aflatoxin exposure in LMICs was very limited. Data from one trial suggested that agricultural education, aimed at changing farmers' post‐harvest practices to reduce aflatoxin exposure, may result in the babies' increased weight‐for‐age, compared to usual or no education. 
The literature was searched to August 2019.
Quality of the evidence 
We have very little confidence in the results. The true effect may be substantially different.

Looking for Medicines to Help Hearts Damaged by Childhood Cancer Drugs

### **Rationale**

**Why did we do this study?**

Some strong drugs are used to treat cancer in children. These drugs are a type of medicine called chemotherapy. They are very good at fighting cancer. One group of these drugs is called anthracyclines.

While these drugs save lives, they can sometimes hurt the heart. This damage can happen during the cancer treatment or many years later. Sometimes, a person can feel the effects of the heart damage, like getting tired easily or having trouble breathing. Other times, the damage is silent, and the person does not feel sick at all.

For adults with heart problems, doctors have many medicines that can help. But we do not know if these same medicines can help children or adult survivors of childhood cancer whose hearts were hurt by cancer drugs.

Doctors need to know the best way to treat this heart damage. This study was done to find out what the research says. We looked for studies that tested medicines for these heart problems to see if they work and if they are safe.

### **Trial Design**

**How did we do this study?**

This was not a study where we gave medicine to patients. Instead, we did a review. A review means we looked for all the studies that have already been done on this topic. We searched for studies that tested drugs to treat heart problems caused by cancer drugs in children.

We looked for a special type of study called a randomized study. In these studies, some people get the real medicine. Other people get a pretend medicine, like a sugar pill. This is called a placebo. This helps researchers see if the real medicine is the reason people get better.

The people in the studies we looked for were children with cancer or adults who had cancer as a child. All of them had heart problems that were caused by the cancer drugs called anthracyclines.

### **Results**

**What did we find?**

After looking everywhere, we only found two studies that matched what we were looking for.

One study looked at a drug called enalapril. It was given to survivors of childhood cancer. These survivors had heart damage but did not feel sick from it. The study found that enalapril helped the heart work a little better over a short time. But, the drug did not seem to help with other important health measures. It also caused side effects for some people, like feeling dizzy or tired. We thought this study was of good quality.

The other study we found was not of very good quality. It tested a drug called phosphocreatine. This drug was given to children with a type of cancer called leukemia who had heart problems. This study found no proof that the drug helped the heart at all.

**What does this mean?**

Right now, there is not enough information to know the best way to treat heart problems caused by cancer drugs in children. The two studies we found do not give us a clear answer.

This means we need more and better studies. Future studies should include more people and watch them for a longer time. This will help doctors and families make the best choices to keep the hearts of childhood cancer survivors healthy.","Treatment for cardiac problems caused by anthracycline chemotherapy for childhood cancer

Injury to the ligaments of the middle joint (proximal interphalangeal joint) of a finger may occur as a result of the finger being forced backwards. This is known as a hyperextension injury. Characteristically, this occurs in sporting accidents, such as where a football strikes an outstretched hand. These injuries are common and typically affect people of working age. Usually, these patients are treated without surgery using a combination of support (splinting/strapping to the adjacent finger) and exercise advice. Use of the hand is commonly encouraged but restricted to some degree by the severity of the injury. By examining the evidence from randomised controlled trials, this review aimed to assess which treatment for hyperextension injuries of the proximal interphalangeal joints of the fingers results in the best outcome for patients. The outcomes examined included function (including return to work), pain and joint movement. 
Three small studies including a total of 366 patients met the inclusion criteria for the review. The studies, which were all over 15 years old, were prone to bias. None of the studies reported any self assessment of function by participants. One study compared unrestricted mobility with immobilisation. One trial compared protected mobilisation (using a removable support in combination with exercise) with immobilisation. The remaining study compared immobilisation for one week versus three weeks. None of these trials found important differences between their intervention groups in various measures of poor outcome, pain and range of movement at six months follow‐up.

Studying the Best Ways to Treat a Jammed Middle Finger Joint

**Rationale**

You can hurt the middle joint of your finger. This often happens if the finger is bent too far backward. Many people call this a ‘jammed finger’. This type of injury is very common, especially during sports when a ball hits your hand.

These injuries can be painful. They can make it hard to use your hand for work or for daily tasks. This can be a problem for many working adults who get this injury.

Doctors usually treat a jammed finger without surgery. They may use a splint to keep the finger from moving. Sometimes they tape the hurt finger to the one next to it for support. Doctors also suggest exercises to help the finger heal. But we are not sure which of these treatments works best. Researchers did this study to find out. They looked at past research to see which treatment helps people get better faster and have the best results.

**Trial Design**

This was a review study. This means the researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they gathered and looked at studies that were already done. They wanted to combine the results from these past studies. This can help find a clear answer about the best way to treat an injury.

The researchers found three small studies to review. In total, 366 people were in these studies. The people in the studies had all hurt their middle finger joint.

The studies compared different treatments for this injury.
*   One study compared letting the finger move freely with keeping it still in a splint.
*   Another study compared using a splint with exercise versus keeping the finger still all the time.
*   The last study looked at the difference between keeping the finger in a splint for one week versus three weeks.

The studies checked on how patients were doing for up to six months after their injury.

**Results**

The review of these studies showed that no single treatment was clearly better than the others. People in the different treatment groups seemed to get better in about the same way. This was true for pain, finger movement, and how well the finger worked.

The researchers did find some problems with the old studies. The studies were all more than 15 years old. They did not include very many people. This makes it hard to be fully sure of the results. Also, the studies did not ask patients to report on how well their own finger was working.

The main conclusion from this review is that we need more and better research. There is not enough good proof to say for sure what the best way to treat a jammed middle finger joint is. We still do not know if keeping the finger still with a splint is needed. If it is needed, we do not know how long is the right amount of time. This review is important because it shows doctors where new studies are needed to help people with these common injuries.","Splints and other non‐surgical methods for treating common injuries of the middle joints of the fingers

10.1002-14651858.CD013505,"Background
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterised by infrequent or absent ovulation, and high levels of androgens and insulin (hyperinsulinaemia). Hyperinsulinaemia occurs secondary to insulin resistance and is associated with an increased biochemical risk profile for cardiovascular disease and an increased prevalence of diabetes mellitus. Insulin‐sensitising agents such as metformin may be effective in treating PCOS‐related anovulation. This is an update of Morley 2017 and only includes studies on metformin. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of metformin in combination with or in comparison to clomiphene citrate (CC), letrozole and laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) in improving reproductive outcomes and associated gastrointestinal side effects for women with PCOS undergoing ovulation induction. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases from inception to December 2018: Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL. We searched registers of ongoing trials and reference lists from relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials of metformin compared with placebo, no treatment, or in combination with or compared with CC, letrozole and LOD for women with PCOS subfertility. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility and bias. Primary outcomes were live birth rate and gastrointestinal adverse effects. Secondary outcomes included other pregnancy outcomes and ovulation. We combined data to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I2 statistic and reported quality of the evidence for primary outcomes and reproductive outcomes using GRADE methodology. 
Main results
We included 41 studies (4552 women). Evidence quality ranged from very low to moderate based on GRADE assessment. Limitations were risk of bias (poor reporting of methodology and incomplete outcome data), imprecision and inconsistency. 
Metformin versus placebo or no treatment 
The evidence suggests that metformin may improve live birth rates compared with placebo (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.51; I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 435 women; low‐quality evidence). For a live birth rate of 19% following placebo, the live birth rate following metformin would be between 19% and 37%. The metformin group probably experiences more gastrointestinal side effects (OR 4.00, 95% CI 2.63 to 6.09; I2 = 39%; 7 studies, 713 women; moderate‐quality evidence). With placebo, the risk of gastrointestinal side effects is 10% whereas with metformin this risk is between 22% and 40%. There are probably higher rates of clinical pregnancy (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.65; I2 = 30%; 11 studies, 1213 women; moderate‐quality evidence). There may be higher rates of ovulation with metformin (OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.85 to 3.75; I2 = 61%; 13 studies, 684 women; low‐quality evidence). We are uncertain about the effect on miscarriage rates (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.35; I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 748 women; low‐quality evidence). 
Metformin plus CC versus CC alone 
We are uncertain if metformin plus CC improves live birth rates compared to CC alone (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.65; I2 = 28%; 10 studies, 1219 women; low‐quality evidence), but gastrointestinal side effects are probably more common with combined therapy (OR 4.26, 95% CI 2.83 to 6.40; I2 = 8%; 6 studies, 852 women; moderate quality evidence). The live birth rate with CC alone is 24%, which may change to between 23% to 34% with combined therapy. With CC alone, the risk of gastrointestinal side effects is 9%, which increases to between 21% to 37% with combined therapy. The combined therapy group probably has higher rates of clinical pregnancy (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.99; I2 = 31%; 19 studies, 1790 women; moderate‐quality evidence). The combined group may have higher rates of ovulation (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.03; I2 = 63%;21 studies, 1568 women; low‐quality evidence). There was no clear evidence of an effect on miscarriage (OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.00; I2 = 0%; 10 studies, 1206 women; low‐quality evidence). 
Metformin versus CC 
When all studies were combined, findings for live birth were inconclusive and inconsistent (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.01; I2 = 86%; 5 studies, 741 women; very low‐quality evidence). In subgroup analysis by obesity status, obese women had a lower birth rate in the metformin group (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.52; 2 studies, 500 women), while the non‐obese group showed a possible benefit from metformin, with high heterogeneity (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.94; I2 = 78%, 3 studies, 241 women; very low‐quality evidence). However, due to the very low quality of the evidence we cannot draw any conclusions. Among obese women taking metformin there may be lower rates of clinical pregnancy (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.55; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 500 women; low‐quality evidence) and ovulation (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.43; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 500 women; low‐quality evidence) while among non‐obese women, the metformin group may have more pregnancies (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.29; I2 = 26%; 6 studies, 530 women; low‐quality evidence) and no clear difference in ovulation rates (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.25; I2 = 0%; 5 studies, 352 women; low‐quality evidence). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in miscarriage rates between the groups (overall: OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.66; I2 = 36%; 6 studies, 781 women; low‐quality evidence) and no studies reported gastrointestinal side effects. 
Authors' conclusions
Our updated review suggests that metformin may be beneficial over placebo for live birth however, more women probably experience gastrointestinal side effects. We are uncertain if metformin plus CC improves live birth rates compared to CC alone, but gastrointestinal side effects are probably increased with combined therapy. When metformin was compared with CC, data for live birth were inconclusive, and the findings were limited by lack of evidence. Results differed by body mass index (BMI), emphasising the importance of stratifying results by BMI. No studies reported gastrointestinal side effects in this comparison. Due to the low quality of the evidence, we are uncertain of the effect of metformin on miscarriage in all three comparisons.

### **Plain Title**

Does the drug metformin help women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) have a baby?

### **Rationale**

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, or PCOS, is a health problem that affects some women. It can make it hard for a woman to get pregnant. This is because PCOS can stop the body from releasing an egg each month, which is needed to start a pregnancy.

PCOS can also cause problems with a hormone in the body called insulin. The body may not use insulin well. This can lead to other health issues, like a higher risk for heart problems or diabetes.

Researchers wanted to know if a drug called metformin could help women with PCOS. Metformin helps the body use insulin in a better way. The researchers thought that if metformin fixed the insulin problems, it might also help women release an egg and get pregnant. This study was done to see if metformin works for this reason.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a single new study. Instead, researchers looked at the results of many past studies to get a bigger picture. This is called a review.

The researchers looked at 41 different studies. These studies included a total of 4,552 women. All the women in the studies had PCOS and were trying to have a baby.

The studies compared metformin to other treatments. Some women took metformin. Some women took a fake pill with no medicine in it, called a placebo. Others took a different drug called clomiphene citrate (or CC) to help them get pregnant. Some women took both metformin and CC.

### **Results**

Here is what the researchers found when they combined the results from all the studies.

**Metformin compared to a fake pill**

*   Metformin may help more women have a baby than a fake pill. For every 100 women who took a fake pill, about 19 had a baby. For every 100 women who took metformin, between 19 and 37 had a baby.
*   However, metformin was more likely to cause side effects. These were mostly stomach problems like an upset stomach or diarrhea. About 1 in 10 women who took a fake pill had stomach problems. For women who took metformin, between 2 and 4 in 10 had these problems.

**Adding metformin to another drug (CC)**

*   The researchers also looked at what happened when women took CC by itself, or CC together with metformin.
*   It was not clear if adding metformin to CC helped more women have a baby. The results were uncertain.
*   Adding metformin to CC did cause more stomach problems. About 1 in 10 women who took CC alone had stomach issues. This went up to between 2 and 4 in 10 women who took both drugs.

**Metformin compared to CC**

*   When researchers compared metformin directly to CC, the results for having a baby were not clear. It was hard to say if one drug was better than the other.
*   The results seemed to be different depending on a woman’s weight. For women with obesity, CC seemed to work better than metformin for getting pregnant and having a baby.
*   For women who did not have obesity, metformin might have worked better. But the proof for this was very weak.

**What the study leaders concluded**

The researchers who led this review came to a few main conclusions. Metformin might be better than a fake pill for helping women with PCOS have a baby. But, it also causes more stomach problems.

Adding metformin to the drug CC did not clearly help more women have a baby, and it led to more side effects. When comparing metformin to CC, a woman’s weight seems to be important, but more research is needed to be sure. The proof from many of the studies was not very strong, so it is hard to be certain about these results.","Metformin for ovulation induction in women with a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome and subfertility 
Review question 
Researchers reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of metformin compared with other ovulation induction agents, for inducing ovulation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Of interest were live birth rate, gastrointestinal side effects and additional reproductive outcomes. 
Background 
Women with PCOS often have infrequent or no periods because they do not ovulate (release an egg), which can result in infertility. They may also develop problems such as obesity and diabetes. High levels of insulin, a hormone that allows the body to use sugar for energy, may be a cause of PCOS and levels are generally higher in obese women. Metformin helps the body use insulin more effectively and improves ovulation in women with PCOS. However, metformin may cause side effects such as nausea, diarrhoea or constipation (gastrointestinal side effects). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies in women with PCOS that compared metformin alone or with CC, letrozole or LOD, against CC, letrozole, LOD, placebo (sham treatment) or no treatment. This review updates the previous version of the review. We included 41 randomised controlled trials (where women were randomly allocated to a treatment) with 4552 women. 13 studies are new for this update. We combined results from the studies and assessed the quality of the studies to judge how confident we could be in their results. The evidence is current up to December 2018. 
Key results 
Metformin versus placebo/no treatment 
Metformin may increase the chances of having a live birth compared with no treatment or placebo, however women taking metformin probably experience more gastrointestinal side effects. With placebo, the live birth rate is 19%, and it would be between 19% and 37% with metformin. The risk of gastrointestinal side effects is 10% with placebo, but higher with metformin, between 22% and 40%. Women taking metformin are probably more likely to get pregnant and may be more likely to ovulate. We are uncertain about the effect of metformin compared to placebo or no treatment on miscarriage. 
Metformin plus CC versus CC alone 
We are uncertain if metformin plus CC improves live birth rate compared to CC alone, but gastrointestinal side effects are probably more common. The live birth rate with CC alone is 24% which may change to between 23% to 34% with metformin and CC combined. With CC alone, the risk of gastrointestinal side effects is 9%, which increases to between 21% to 37% with metformin and CC combined. However, pregnancy rate is probably improved with metformin and CC. Ovulation rates may be improved with metformin and CC. There was no clear evidence of an effect on miscarriage. 
Metformin versus CC 
We combined all the studies and found that the quality of evidence was very low, results were inconsistent, and we could not confidently draw conclusions. Obese women had a lower birth rate with metformin, while non‐obese women showed a possible benefit from metformin. The live birth rate of non‐obese women with CC is 26%, which may increase to between 26% and 50% with metformin. However, in obese women, the live birth rate is 22% which may decrease to between 5% to 13% with metformin. Similarly, among obese women taking metformin there may be lower rates of clinical pregnancy and ovulation while, non‐obese women taking metformin may have more pregnancies; there was no clear difference in ovulation rates. We are uncertain whether there is a difference in miscarriage rates between women taking metformin or CC. No studies reported gastrointestinal side effects. It is possible that a woman's body mass index (a measure of healthy weight based on height and weight) affects which treatment she should take, although further research is required to establish this. The limited improvement in outcomes such as diabetes with metformin highlights the importance of weight loss and lifestyle adjustment, particularly in overweight women with PCOS. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main problems were that the studies’ methods were poor or unclear, or they did not report all their results (risk of bias), or they were inaccurate and inconsistent.

Pneumonia is a serious lung infection and is usually treated with antibiotics. Bacteria which cause community‐acquired pneumonia (CAP, pneumonia contracted outside healthcare settings) are traditionally divided into 'typical' and 'atypical', each dictating a different antibiotic treatment. Atypical bacteria include, Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae). The main 'typical' agent causing CAP is Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae). It is usually not possible to determine which of the many potential agents is the cause of CAP, so that antibiotic treatment is empirical, customarily covering both typical and atypical bacteria. While typical coverage is essential, the necessity of the atypical coverage has not been proven. In the previous version of this review we showed that there was no advantage to the atypical arm. Given the persisting inconsistency between current guidelines for treatment of pneumonia and the available evidence, we undertook to update this systematic review. 
This Cochrane review looked at trials comparing antibiotic regimens with atypical coverage to those without, limited to hospitalized adults with CAP. We included 28 trials, involving 5939 patients. For the regimens tested, no advantage was found for regimens covering atypical bacteria in the major outcomes tested ‐ mortality and clinical efficacy. There was no significant difference between the groups in the frequency of total adverse events, or those requiring discontinuation of treatment. However, gastrointestinal events were less common in the atypical arm.

Do Special Antibiotics Help Adults in the Hospital with Pneumonia?

**Rationale**

Pneumonia is a serious infection in the lungs. It can make you feel very sick and you may need to go to the hospital. Doctors use strong medicines called antibiotics to fight the germs, or bacteria, that cause pneumonia.

There are two main types of germs that cause pneumonia. One type is called ‘typical’ germs. The other type is called ‘atypical’ germs. Each type of germ is best fought by a different kind of antibiotic.

When you first get to the hospital, doctors often do not know which type of germ is making you sick. To be safe, they may give you antibiotics that fight both typical and atypical germs. But these extra medicines can cause side effects. Researchers wanted to know if giving the special antibiotic for atypical germs is really needed. This study looked at past research to see if using these special antibiotics helped people get better.

**Trial Design**

This was not a new study with its own patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of many past studies to find an answer. This is called a review. It helps to bring all the information together in one place.

The researchers found 28 studies to review. These studies included about 6,000 adults in total. All these adults were in the hospital because of pneumonia. They got sick with pneumonia while living at home or in their community, not in a hospital or nursing home.

In the studies, patients were put into two groups. One group got antibiotics that only fought typical germs. The other group got antibiotics that fought atypical germs. Researchers then compared the results from the two groups to see which treatment worked better.

**Results**

The researchers found that giving the special antibiotics for atypical germs did not help most patients.

People who got the special antibiotics did not have a better chance of survival. The number of people who died was about the same in both groups. People who got the special antibiotics also did not get better any faster than the other group.

The researchers also looked at side effects, which are unwanted problems from a medicine. Overall, the number of side effects was about the same for both groups. However, people who took the special antibiotics for atypical germs had fewer stomach problems, like feeling sick or having diarrhea.

The researchers said that the studies they reviewed had some weak points. In many studies, both the doctors and the patients knew which medicine they were getting. This can sometimes change the results. Also, drug companies that make the special antibiotics paid for most of the studies. The researchers said this could have affected the results.

Based on all the information, the researchers concluded that for adults in the hospital with pneumonia, adding a special antibiotic to kill atypical germs may not be needed.","Initial antibiotic treatment for coverage of 'atypical' pathogens for community‐acquired pneumonia in hospitalized adults

What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to determine whether mindfulness‐based interventions (MBIs) i.e. interventions involving training in mindfulness meditation improve symptoms of substance use disorders (SUDs) (i.e. alcohol and/or drug use, but excluding tobacco use disorders). Cochrane researchers searched, selected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer this question. We found 40 randomized controlled trials,that assessed MBI as a treatment for SUDs. 
Key messages 
SUD outcomes were monitored at different time points: directly following completion of the MBIs, and at follow‐up time points, which ranged from 3 months to 10 months after the MBI ended. Relative to other interventions (standard of care, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychoeducation, support group, physical exercise, medication), MBIs may slightly reduce days with substance use, but it is very uncertain whether they reduce other SUD‐related outcomes. The effects of MBIs relative to no treatment was very uncertain across all SUD‐assessed outcomes, as was the risk for adverse events. 
What was studied in this review? 
SUDs are very common and associated with negative physical and psychological health outcomes. Although evidence‐based interventions exist for treating SUDs, the standard treatments may not be sufficient and many individuals relapse to substance use. In the past several decades, MBIs have been examined for the treatment of SUDs. MBIs involve training in mindfulness meditation practice, which emphasizes the cultivation of present‐moment, non‐judgmental awareness. MBIs may improve many of the psychological variables involved in substance use and relapse (i.e. depression, anxiety, stress, attention). We studied whether MBIs benefit individuals with SUDs. 
We searched for studies that compared an MBI to no treatment or to another treatment (e.g. cognitive behavior therapy, psychoeducation). We studied the results at the end of the intervention and at follow‐up assessments, which occurred 3 to 10 months following the end of the intervention. 
What are the main results of this review? 
The review authors found 40 relevant studies, of which 45% were focused on individuals with various SUDs with the remaining studies including participants using a specific substance (e.g. alcohol, opioids). Of these 40 studies, 23 were conducted in the USA, 11 were conducted in Iran, two were conducted in Thailand, one was conducted in Brazil, one was conducted in China, one was conducted in Taiwan, and one was conducted in both Spain and the USA. We were able to analyze results of 35 studies composed of 2825 participants; the other five did not report usable results, and requests to the authors for more information were unsuccessful. 
When MBIs were compared with other treatments, our review and analysis showed that MBIs may slightly reduce days with substance use at post‐treatment and follow‐up, and show similar study retention. The evidence is uncertain for other SUD‐related outcomes we assessed (continuous abstinence, consumed amount, craving intensity). When MBIs were compared with no treatment, the evidence was uncertain for all SUD‐related outcomes, although MBIs showed similar treatment retention. Adverse effects were only reported on in four studies. However, the available evidence did not suggest MBIs result in adverse events or serious adverse events.

Can Mindfulness Training Help People with Drug or Alcohol Problems?

### **Rationale**

Using too much alcohol or drugs can cause serious health problems. This is called a substance use disorder. It can harm a person’s body and mind. It can also make life very difficult for them and their families.

Many people find it very hard to stop using drugs or alcohol, even with current treatments. Sometimes, even when people do stop, they may start using again later. Because of this, doctors and researchers are always looking for new ways to help.

This study looked at a type of training called mindfulness. Mindfulness teaches you how to pay attention to the present moment. You learn to notice your thoughts, feelings, and what is happening in your body without judging them. Researchers thought this training might help with feelings like stress, worry, and sadness. These feelings can often lead people to use drugs or alcohol. The main idea was to see if mindfulness training could help people use drugs or alcohol less often.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of many past studies to get a bigger and clearer picture. This is called a review.

The researchers found 40 different studies that had already been completed. In total, these studies included more than 2,800 people who had problems with using alcohol or drugs. The studies took place in many different countries, including the United States, Iran, and Thailand.

In each of these studies, people were split into different groups by chance. One group received mindfulness training. The other groups received a different kind of help. This other help could be standard treatments, talk therapy, or a support group. Some studies also compared mindfulness training to getting no treatment at all.

Researchers looked at how people were doing right after their training or treatment ended. They also checked on them again several months later. This follow-up time ranged from 3 to 10 months after the training finished.

### **Results**

The researchers combined the results from all the studies to see what they showed overall.

When they compared mindfulness training to other treatments, they found that mindfulness training might help a little. People who had mindfulness training used drugs or alcohol on slightly fewer days than people who had other treatments. For other goals, like quitting completely or having fewer cravings, the results were not clear. The researchers are very unsure if mindfulness helped with those things.

When they compared mindfulness training to getting no treatment, the evidence was also very uncertain. This means we do not know if mindfulness was better than getting no help at all.

Very few studies talked about bad side effects. From the small amount of information they had, it does not seem that mindfulness training causes serious harm. People in the mindfulness groups were just as likely to finish the study as people in other treatment groups.

The researchers concluded that mindfulness training might be a small help for people with drug or alcohol problems. But the evidence is not very strong. We need more and better studies to be sure about the benefits of mindfulness. The information in this review included studies published up to April 2021.","Mindfulness‐based interventions for substance use disorders

Although corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission of Crohn's disease, many patients relapse when steroids are withdrawn or become steroid dependent. Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant side effects. Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug that is used to treat active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. This review includes seven randomized trials with a total of 495 participants. There is evidence from one large study which suggests that methotrexate (25 mg/week) injected intramuscularly for 16 weeks among patients with active treatment resistant Crohn's disease may provide a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids. This reduction in steroid use could reduce steroid‐induced side effects for people with chronic Crohn's disease. Although side effects are more common with high dose methotrexate therapy, no serious side effects have been observed. Common side effects associated with methotrexate therapy include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash and headache. Studies comparing lower dose oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) to placebo (e.g. sugar pill) or other active drugs (e.g. azathioprine or 6‐mercaptopurine) indicate that lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any benefit for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. However, these trials were small in size and further studies of oral methotrexate may be justified. Two studies looked at the combination of methotrexate and infliximab (a biological drug) compared to infliximab therapy alone. These studies indicated that the addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infiximab. However these studies were relatively small and further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies.

A study of the drug methotrexate for Crohn's disease that is hard to treat

### **Rationale**

Crohn’s disease is a long-term health problem. It causes swelling and pain in the gut, which is the tube that carries food through your body. This can make people feel very sick.

Doctors often use strong medicines called steroids to treat Crohn’s disease. Steroids can help people feel better at first. But for many people, the sickness comes back when they stop taking steroids. Some people must keep taking steroids to stay well. This can be a problem because using steroids for a long time can cause other health issues.

This study looked at a different medicine called methotrexate. This drug works by calming down your body’s defense system. The body’s defense system is what normally fights off germs. In Crohn's disease, this system attacks the gut by mistake. Researchers wanted to know if methotrexate could help control Crohn’s disease. They hoped it would let people stop taking steroids and avoid their side effects.

### **Trial Design**

This report is a review. This means researchers looked at the results of many studies all at once. This helps them get a bigger, clearer picture. They looked at 7 different studies. A total of 495 people with Crohn's disease took part in these studies.

All the people in the studies had active Crohn’s disease. This means they were having symptoms. Their sickness was also hard to treat with other medicines.

The studies were designed in different ways to answer different questions:
*   One large study compared a high dose of methotrexate with a placebo. A placebo is a dummy treatment, like a shot with no medicine in it. People got the shot in their muscle once a week for 16 weeks.
*   Other smaller studies looked at a lower dose of methotrexate taken as a pill. They compared it to a sugar pill or to other medicines for Crohn’s disease.
*   Two studies looked at what happened when people took methotrexate together with another drug called infliximab. They compared this group to people who only took infliximab.

### **Results**

Here is what the researchers found when they looked at all the studies together.

The large study showed that a high-dose shot of methotrexate helped. More people who got the methotrexate shot went into remission. Remission is a time when the symptoms of a sickness get much better or go away. These people were also able to stop taking steroids completely. This is a key benefit because it can lower the chance of having side effects from steroids.

The studies that looked at a lower dose of methotrexate taken as a pill did not show a benefit. The drug did not seem to work better than a sugar pill. However, these studies were very small. More research may be needed to be sure about the pill form of methotrexate.

When methotrexate was used with another drug called infliximab, it did not seem to add any extra benefit. People who took both drugs did not do better than people who only took infliximab. These studies were also small, so more research is needed here too.

Like all medicines, methotrexate can have side effects. The most common ones were feeling sick to your stomach, throwing up, belly pain, diarrhea, skin rashes, or headaches. In these studies, no one had any very serious side effects from the drug.

The main conclusion from this review is that high-dose methotrexate, given as a shot, can help people with hard-to-treat Crohn’s disease. It can help them feel better and stop using steroids.","Methotrexate for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease

Review question 
Phototherapy is a pain‐free method of treatment that uses light to treat various medical conditions. We reviewed the evidence about phototherapy for foot ulcers in people with diabetes. We wanted to find out whether phototherapy speeds up wound healing and improves patients' quality of life, and whether there are any side effects. 
Background 
Foot ulcers are a disabling complication of diabetes that affect 15% to 25% of people with diabetes at some time in their lives. Diabetic foot ulcers are painful and prone to infection. Not all diabetic foot ulcers can be healed, which can ultimately lead to surgical removal of a limb. Phototherapy involves exposing the affected area to ultraviolet light, sometimes using lasers. This is thought to help ulcers heal through multiple mechanisms such as increased cell growth and blood vessel activity. It has been used as an alternative approach for healing foot ulcers in people with diabetes. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing different phototherapies, or comparing phototherapy with other treatments or a placebo (sham treatment), for foot ulcers in adults with diabetes in October 2016. We included eight trials (316 participants). Most studies were undertaken in clinics or hospitals and had small numbers of participants (14 to 84). The average age in the included studies was from 53 to 68 years, and the ratio of females to males was 0.46 to 1.88. The included studies compared phototherapy with placebo or no phototherapy, on top of usual care (usual care could include treatments such as dressings, antibiotics, or wound cleaning). Treatment times ranged from 15 days to 20 weeks. 
Key results 
The results suggested that phototherapy, when compared to no phototherapy or a placebo, may increase the proportion of wounds completely healed during follow‐up and reduce wound size. However, as the included studies involved small numbers of participants and had drawbacks in study methods, our confidence in these results is limited. We did not find sufficient evidence that the potential harms or incidence of amputations differed between the phototherapy group and the no phototherapy/placebo group. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the quality of the evidence to be low due to a lack of data and risk of the study results being biased. Further high‐quality studies are needed to confirm the benefits and harms of phototherapy.

Using Light to Treat Foot Sores in People with Diabetes

**Rationale**
People with diabetes can get sores on their feet. These sores are called foot ulcers. Foot sores can be a big problem. They can be very painful and can get infected easily.

When a sore gets infected or does not heal, it can become very serious. In some cases, a doctor may need to remove a foot or part of a leg to stop the infection from spreading. This is a surgery called an amputation. Because foot sores can lead to these serious problems, doctors are always looking for better ways to treat them.

One possible treatment is called phototherapy. This is a treatment that uses special light to help the body heal. It does not cause any pain. A special light is aimed at the foot sore. Doctors think this light may help new skin cells grow. It may also help more blood flow to the sore, which brings what the body needs to heal.

This study looked at past research on light therapy. We wanted to see if it is a good treatment for foot sores in people with diabetes. We wanted to know if it helps sores heal faster and if it is safe to use.

**Trial Design**
This was not a new study with patients. Instead, our team looked at the results of other studies that were already completed. This is called a review. A review helps us see what all the research on a topic says when looked at together.

We searched for studies in October 2016. We found eight different studies to review. In total, 316 people with diabetes and foot sores took part in these studies. The studies were mostly done in clinics and hospitals.

The people in these studies were adults, with an average age between 53 and 68 years old. There were both men and women in the studies. In the studies we looked at, some people got the real light therapy. Other people were in a group that got no light therapy or a fake light therapy. A fake therapy, called a placebo, looks like the real treatment but does nothing. This helps researchers know if the real treatment is actually working.

Everyone in all the groups still received the normal care for their foot sores. This normal care included things like wound cleaning and fresh bandages. The amount of time people received treatment was different in each study, from about two weeks to 20 weeks.

**Results**
After looking at all eight studies, we found that light therapy might help heal foot sores. The results showed that more sores seemed to heal completely in the groups that got light therapy. The sores also seemed to get smaller in size compared to the groups that did not get light therapy.

However, we cannot be very sure about these results. The studies we reviewed were small. Some of them only had a few dozen people. The studies also had some problems with how they were designed and run. Because of these issues, our trust in the results is low.

We also looked to see if light therapy caused any harm or side effects. We did not find enough information to say if light therapy was safer or more dangerous than normal care. We also could not tell if it changed the number of people who needed to have a leg or foot removed.

In conclusion, there is not enough good proof right now to know for sure if light therapy helps. We need more and better studies with more people. These future studies will help us understand the real benefits and any possible harms of using light therapy for foot sores.","Phototherapy for treating foot ulcers in people with diabetes

10.1002-14651858.CD008685.pub2,"The optimal warfarin dose for patients beginning therapy
Warfarin is commonly prescribed to prevent blot clots in patients with medical conditions such as atrial fibrillation, heart valve replacement or previous blood clots. Warfarin is an effective treatment which has been used for many years but needs to be closely monitored, especially at the beginning of treatment, as there is a wide variation in response to dose. Monitoring of the response to dose is done using an International Normalized Ratio (INR) and it is important that patients remain within a narrow range (typically 2 to 3 INR) due to the need to balance the goal of preventing blood clots with the risk of causing excessive bleeding. 
This review included 12 randomised controlled trials comparing different warfarin doses given to patients beginning warfarin treatment. Most of the studies had a high risk of bias so the results were interpreted with caution. 
Those trials that were included compared loading doses in several different situations. The review authors divided the trials into four categories, 5 mg versus 10 mg initial doses (four studies), 5 mg versus other doses (two studies), 5 mg or 10 mg versus age adjusted doses (two studies), 5 mg or 10 mg versus genotype adjusted doses (four studies). 
The review authors concluded that there is still considerable uncertainty between the use of a 5 mg and a 10 mg loading dose for the initiation of warfarin. In the elderly, there is some evidence that lower initiation doses or age adjusted doses are more appropriate. However, there is insufficient evidence to warrant genotype adjusted dosing. We also found no data to suggest that any one method was safer than another.

Finding the Best Starting Dose for the Blood Thinner Warfarin

**Rationale**

Some health problems can cause harmful blood clots to form in the body. These problems include an uneven heartbeat or having a new heart valve. Blood clots can be very dangerous. They can travel to the brain and cause a stroke. They can also travel to the lungs.

Doctors often give a medicine called warfarin to stop these clots from forming. Warfarin is a type of medicine called a blood thinner. It has been used for many years.

Finding the right dose of warfarin can be tricky. Each person needs a different amount. Too much warfarin can cause serious bleeding. Too little may not stop clots. When you start taking warfarin, your doctor will check your blood often. This is to find the dose that is right for you. A blood test called the INR measures how fast your blood clots. Your doctor uses this test to see if your dose is safe and working well.

Because it is hard to find the right starting dose, researchers wanted to help. They looked at past studies to see if there was a best way to start people on warfarin. They wanted to find out which starting dose works best for most people.

**Trial Design**

This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of 12 older studies. This is called a review. The 12 studies they looked at were called randomized controlled trials. This means that in each study, people were put into groups by chance to try different treatments.

All the people in these studies were adults who were starting warfarin for the first time. The researchers put the 12 studies into four groups to compare them.

*   One group of studies compared a 5 milligram (mg) starting dose to a 10 mg dose.
*   Another group compared a 5 mg dose to other different doses.
*   A third group compared a 5 mg or 10 mg dose to doses based on a person’s age.
*   The last group compared a 5 mg or 10 mg dose to doses based on a person’s genes. Genes are the instructions inside our bodies.

The researchers read these studies to find patterns. They wanted to see if one starting dose was better or safer than another.

**Results**

The researchers found that we still do not know the best starting dose for everyone.

For most adults, there was no clear proof that starting with a 10 mg dose was better than starting with a 5 mg dose. More research is needed to know for sure. The researchers also noted that some of the studies they reviewed had flaws. This means the results should be viewed with care.

For older adults, the results were a bit different. The review found some proof that lower starting doses are a better choice for them. Doses based on a person’s age may also work well for older adults.

The researchers also looked at using a person's genes to pick a dose. They found that there was not enough proof to say this is a good way to choose a starting dose.

Finally, the study did not find that any one starting dose was safer than another. No method seemed to lower the risk of serious bleeding. The researchers concluded that we are still not sure what the best way is to start warfarin. But, for older people, a lower dose or one based on age may be best.","The optimal warfarin dose for patients beginning therapy
Warfarin is commonly prescribed to prevent blot clots in patients with medical conditions such as atrial fibrillation, heart valve replacement or previous blood clots. Warfarin is an effective treatment which has been used for many years but needs to be closely monitored, especially at the beginning of treatment, as there is a wide variation in response to dose. Monitoring of the response to dose is done using an International Normalized Ratio (INR) and it is important that patients remain within a narrow range (typically 2 to 3 INR) due to the need to balance the goal of preventing blood clots with the risk of causing excessive bleeding. 
This review included 12 randomised controlled trials comparing different warfarin doses given to patients beginning warfarin treatment. Most of the studies had a high risk of bias so the results were interpreted with caution. 
Those trials that were included compared loading doses in several different situations. The review authors divided the trials into four categories, 5 mg versus 10 mg initial doses (four studies), 5 mg versus other doses (two studies), 5 mg or 10 mg versus age adjusted doses (two studies), 5 mg or 10 mg versus genotype adjusted doses (four studies). 
The review authors concluded that there is still considerable uncertainty between the use of a 5 mg and a 10 mg loading dose for the initiation of warfarin. In the elderly, there is some evidence that lower initiation doses or age adjusted doses are more appropriate. However, there is insufficient evidence to warrant genotype adjusted dosing. We also found no data to suggest that any one method was safer than another.

Loss of olfactory function is well recognised as a symptom of COVID‐19 infection, and the pandemic has resulted in a large number of individuals with abnormalities in their sense of smell. For many, the condition is temporary and resolves within two to four weeks. However, in a significant minority the symptoms persist. At present, it is not known whether early intervention with any form of treatment (such as medication or olfactory training) can promote recovery and prevent persisting olfactory disturbance. This is an update of the 2021 review with four studies added. 
Objectives
1) To evaluate the benefits and harms of any intervention versus no treatment for people with acute olfactory dysfunction due to COVID‐19 infection.  
2) To keep the evidence up‐to‐date, using a living systematic review approach. 
Search methods
The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the latest search was 20 October 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people with COVID‐19 related olfactory disturbance, which had been present for less than four weeks. We included any intervention compared to no treatment or placebo.  
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were the presence of normal olfactory function, serious adverse effects and change in sense of smell. Secondary outcomes were the prevalence of parosmia, change in sense of taste, disease‐related quality of life and other adverse effects (including nosebleeds/bloody discharge). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.  
Main results
We included five studies with 691 participants. The studies evaluated the following interventions: intranasal corticosteroid sprays, intranasal corticosteroid drops, intranasal hypertonic saline and zinc sulphate.  
Intranasal corticosteroid spray compared to no intervention/placebo  
We included three studies with 288 participants who had olfactory dysfunction for less than four weeks following COVID‐19. 
Presence of normal olfactory function 
The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of intranasal corticosteroid spray on both self‐rated recovery of olfactory function and recovery of olfactory function using psychophysical tests at up to four weeks follow‐up (self‐rated: risk ratio (RR) 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.68; 1 study; 100 participants; psychophysical testing: RR 2.3, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.63; 1 study; 77 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).  
Change in sense of smell 
The evidence is also very uncertain about the effect of intranasal corticosteroid spray on self‐rated change in the sense of smell (at less than 4 weeks: mean difference (MD) 0.5 points lower, 95% CI 1.38 lower to 0.38 higher; 1 study; 77 participants; at > 4 weeks to 3 months: MD 2.4 points higher, 95% CI 1.32 higher to 3.48 higher; 1 study; 100 participants; very low‐certainty evidence, rated on a scale of 1 to 10, higher scores mean better olfactory function). Intranasal corticosteroids may make little or no difference to the change in sense of smell when assessed with psychophysical testing (MD 0.2 points, 95% CI 2.06 points lower to 2.06 points higher; 1 study; 77 participants; low‐certainty evidence, 0‐ to 24‐point scale, higher scores mean better olfactory function).  
Serious adverse effects 
The authors of one study reported no adverse effects, but their intention to collect these data was not pre‐specified so we are uncertain if these were systematically sought and identified. The remaining two studies did not report on adverse effects.  
Intranasal corticosteroid drops compared to no intervention/placebo  
We included one study with 248 participants who had olfactory dysfunction for ≤ 15 days following COVID‐19. 
Presence of normal olfactory function 
Intranasal corticosteroid drops may make little or no difference to self‐rated recovery at > 4 weeks to 3 months (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.11; 1 study; 248 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No other outcomes were assessed by this study.  
Data on the use of hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and the use of zinc sulphate to prevent persistent olfactory dysfunction are included in the full text of the review. 
Authors' conclusions
There is very limited evidence available on the efficacy and harms of treatments for preventing persistent olfactory dysfunction following COVID‐19 infection. However, we have identified a number of ongoing trials in this area. As this is a living systematic review we will update the data regularly, as new results become available.

Looking at Early Treatments for Loss of Smell from COVID-19

### **Rationale**

Many people who get sick with COVID-19 lose their sense of smell. For most people, their sense of smell comes back on its own in a few weeks. This is a good thing, and they recover fully.

But for some people, the problem can last for a long time. Not being able to smell can be very hard. It can change how food tastes and make it hard to enjoy meals. It can also be unsafe. For example, a person might not be able to smell smoke from a fire or food that has gone bad.

Doctors want to find ways to help people get their smell back faster. They wonder if using a treatment right after someone gets sick can help. They think that treating the problem early might stop the smell loss from becoming a long-term issue.

Right now, we do not have clear proof about what works best. This study was done to look at all the research that has been done so far. The main goal was to find out if any treatments are helpful and safe for people who have just lost their sense of smell from COVID-19.

### **Trial Design**

This study was a special type of review. The researchers did not work with patients directly. Instead, they looked for all the best studies that had already been finished on this topic. This is called a ""systematic review."" This type of study helps to bring all the information from many different studies together in one place.

The researchers looked for studies called ""randomized controlled trials."" These are studies where people are put into groups by chance. One group gets a real treatment. The other group gets a fake treatment, which is called a placebo, or they get no treatment at all. This is the best way to see if a treatment really works.

The researchers found five studies to include in their review. These studies had a total of 691 people. All of these people had lost their sense of smell from COVID-19. They had only had the problem for less than four weeks when they joined their studies.

The studies they found tested a few different treatments. Some studies looked at steroid nose sprays or steroid nose drops. Other studies looked at salt water rinses for the nose or a pill called zinc. The studies checked to see if people who got a treatment did better than people who got no treatment.

### **Results**

The researchers looked at the results from the five studies they found. They wanted to know if the treatments helped people get their sense of smell back. They also looked to see if the treatments caused any harm or side effects.

Three of the studies tested steroid nose sprays. After looking at the results, the researchers could not be sure if the sprays helped. The proof was not strong enough to say yes or no. The researchers called the evidence ""very uncertain."" The studies also did not report clearly about side effects, so it is hard to know if the sprays were safe.

One study looked at steroid nose drops. The results from this study showed that the drops may make little or no difference. People who used the drops were not more likely to get their sense of smell back compared to those who did not use them.

The researchers noted that other treatments were studied, like salt water rinses and zinc. But the main summary did not give details on the results for these treatments. Overall, the researchers could not find good proof that any early treatment helps people get their sense of smell back after COVID-19.

This review shows that we still do not know the best way to treat smell loss right after a person gets COVID-19. The studies that have been done so far are not enough to give a clear answer. We need more and better research to be sure what works and what is safe.

The researchers who did this review concluded that there is very little proof right now for these treatments. The good news is that many new studies on this topic are being done. The researchers plan to keep this review up to date. As new studies are finished, they will add the new results. This will help us learn more in the future.","Interventions for the prevention of persistent smell disorders (olfactory dysfunction) after COVID‐19 infection 
Why this is important 
COVID‐19 has been found to cause problems with the sense of smell. Sometimes this is a reduction in the ability to smell things, and sometimes it is a complete loss of the sense of smell. For many people this recovers in a short time, but for others it may last for weeks or months. This review considers whether there are treatments that people might take as soon as they have lost their sense of smell (within four weeks of the symptoms starting), to try and stop this becoming a long‐standing problem. 
How we identified and assessed the evidence 
We searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature to summarise the results. We also looked at how certain the evidence was, considering things like the size of the studies and how they were carried out. Based on this, we classed the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. 
What we found 
We found five studies that had been completed. 
Intranasal corticosteroids compared to no treatment  
Three studies looked at this treatment. 
Nasal corticosteroid spray might make little or no difference to the sense of smell when measured with specific tests (rather than when asking people about their sense of smell). 
The rest of the evidence was of very low certainty, so we do not know whether a nasal corticosteroid spray is better or worse than no treatment at: 
‐ helping the sense of smell get back to normal (either people feeling that their sense of smell is back to normal, or having a normal sense of smell according to specific tests); 
‐ making people feel that their sense of smell has improved;
‐ causing any unwanted side effects.
Intranasal corticosteroid drops compared to placebo (dummy treatment) 
One study looked at this treatment.
Intranasal corticosteroid drops might not make any difference to the number of people who think their sense of smell has recovered at 30 days.  
We did find a number of other studies that are being carried out, but no results from these studies were available yet to be included in this review. 
What this means 
We do not know whether using a nasal corticosteroid spray or nasal drops has any benefit in preventing longer‐term loss of the sense of smell that is related to COVID‐19, or whether they may cause any harm. This review is a 'living systematic review' ‐ meaning that we will keep checking for new studies that might be relevant, and the review will be continually updated when any extra results are available. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to October 2021.

Previous Cochrane Reviews have shown that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is effective in treating childhood anxiety disorders. However, questions remain regarding the following: up‐to‐date evidence of the relative efficacy and acceptability of CBT compared to waiting lists/no treatment, treatment as usual, attention controls, and alternative treatments; benefits across a range of outcomes; longer‐term effects; outcomes for different delivery formats; and amongst children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and children with intellectual impairments. 
Objectives
To examine the effect of CBT for childhood anxiety disorders, in comparison with waitlist/no treatment, treatment as usual (TAU), attention control, alternative treatment, and medication. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (all years to 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO (each to October 2019), international trial registries, and conducted grey literature searches. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials of CBT that involved direct contact with the child, parent, or both, and included non‐CBT comparators (waitlist/no treatment, treatment as usual, attention control, alternative treatment, medication). Participants were younger than age 19, and met diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder diagnosis. Primary outcomes were remission of primary anxiety diagnosis post‐treatment, and acceptability (number of participants lost to post‐treatment assessment), and secondary outcomes included remission of all anxiety diagnoses, reduction in anxiety symptoms, reduction in depressive symptoms, improvement in global functioning, adverse effects, and longer‐term effects. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 87 studies and 5964 participants in quantitative analyses.
Compared with waitlist/no treatment, CBT probably increases post‐treatment remission of primary anxiety diagnoses (CBT: 49.4%, waitlist/no treatment: 17.8%; OR 5.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.90 to 7.60; n = 2697, 39 studies, moderate quality); NNTB 3 (95% CI 2.25 to 3.57) and all anxiety diagnoses (OR 4.43, 95% CI 2.89 to 6.78; n = 2075, 28 studies, moderate quality). 
Low‐quality evidence did not show a difference between CBT and TAU in post‐treatment primary anxiety disorder remission (OR 3.19, 95% CI 0.90 to 11.29; n = 487, 8 studies), but did suggest CBT may increase remission from all anxiety disorders compared to TAU (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.16 to 6.46; n = 203, 5 studies). 
Compared with attention control, CBT may increase post‐treatment remission of primary anxiety disorders (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.33 to 3.89; n = 822, 10 studies, low quality) and all anxiety disorders (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.22 to 6.17; n = 378, 5 studies, low quality). 
There was insufficient available data to compare CBT to alternative treatments on post‐treatment remission of primary anxiety disorders, and low‐quality evidence showed there may be little to no difference between these groups on post‐treatment remission of all anxiety disorders (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.23; n = 401, 4 studies) 
Low‐quality evidence did not show a difference for acceptability between CBT and waitlist/no treatment (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.41; n=3158, 45 studies), treatment as usual (OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.56; n = 441, 8 studies), attention control (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.49; n = 797, 12 studies) and alternative treatment (OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.13; n=515, 7 studies). 
No adverse effects were reported across all studies; however, in the small number of studies where any reference was made to adverse effects, it was not clear that these were systematically monitored. 
Results from the anxiety symptom outcomes, broader outcomes, longer‐term outcomes and subgroup analyses are provided in the text. 
We did not find evidence of consistent differences in outcomes according to delivery formats (e.g. individual versus group; amount of therapist contact time) or amongst samples with and without ASD, and no studies included samples of children with intellectual impairments. 
Authors' conclusions
CBT is probably more effective in the short‐term than waiting lists/no treatment, and may be more effective than attention control. We found little to no evidence across outcomes that CBT is superior to usual care or alternative treatments, but our confidence in these findings are limited due to concerns about the amount and quality of available evidence, and we still know little about how best to efficiently improve outcomes.

A Review of Studies on a Talk Therapy for Children with Anxiety

### **Rationale**

Many children feel worried or scared sometimes. This is a normal part of growing up. But for some children, these feelings can be very strong. They can get in the way of school, fun, and making friends. When this happens, it is called an anxiety disorder.

A type of talk therapy called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT, can help. CBT helps children understand their anxious thoughts. It teaches them new ways to think and act. This helps them feel less worried and more in control.

Past studies have shown that CBT helps children with anxiety. But researchers wanted to find out more. They wanted to know if CBT works better than other options. These options include getting no treatment, getting the usual care from a doctor, or trying other types of therapy. This review was done to bring all the information together. This helps doctors and families make the best choices for treating childhood anxiety.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, the researchers looked at many studies that were already done. This is called a review. By looking at many studies together, researchers can get a stronger answer.

They searched for the best type of studies. These are called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, people are put into different groups by chance. This helps make the results more fair and reliable.

The researchers found 87 different studies to include in their review. These studies involved almost 6,000 children and teens in total. All the young people in these studies were under 19 years old. They had all been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder by a doctor.

In the studies, some children got CBT. The researchers compared them to children in other groups. These other groups included children who were on a waiting list for treatment, children getting the usual care from their doctor, or children getting a different kind of therapy.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The researchers wanted to know if CBT helped children’s anxiety get better. They also wanted to see if children were able to stick with the therapy.

**Does CBT work better than no treatment?**
Yes, it seems to work better. The review showed that CBT helped more children get better than being on a waiting list with no treatment.
*   For every 100 children who got CBT, about 49 of them got better from their main anxiety problem.
*   For every 100 children on a waiting list, only about 18 of them got better.

**Is CBT better than the usual care?**
The researchers also compared CBT to the usual care a child might get from their regular doctor. They did not find a clear difference between these two groups for the main anxiety problem. The proof they found for this was not very strong.

**What about other therapies?**
CBT seemed to work better than therapies where children just got general attention from a therapist. There was not enough information to know if CBT works better than other specific types of talk therapy.

**Did children stick with the therapy?**
The researchers checked how many children left the studies early. They found no real difference between the children who got CBT and those who got other treatments. This suggests that children and their families found CBT to be an acceptable treatment.

**Were there any bad side effects?**
None of the studies reported any bad side effects from CBT. But, the researchers who did the review said it was not clear if the studies looked for side effects carefully.

**What did the researchers conclude?**
The team that did this review concluded that CBT is a helpful treatment for children with anxiety. It is likely better than getting no treatment at all. We still need more good studies to know for sure if CBT is better than usual care or other types of therapy for children with anxiety.","Cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety in children and young people
Why is this review important? 
Many children and young people experience problems with anxiety. Children and young people with anxiety disorders are more likely than their peers to have difficulty with friendships, family life, and school, and to develop mental health problems later in life. Therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can help children and young people to overcome difficulties with anxiety by using new ways of thinking and facing their fears. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
Parents, children, and young people; people working in education and mental health services for children and young people; and general practitioners. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
This review updates and replaces previous Cochrane Reviews from 2005 and 2015, which showed that CBT is an effective treatment for children and young people with anxiety disorders. 
This review aimed to answer the following questions:
• Is CBT more effective than a waiting list or no treatment?
• Is CBT more effective than other treatments and medication?
• Does CBT help to reduce anxiety for children and young people in the longer term?
• Are some types of CBT more effective than others? (e.g. individual versus group therapy) 
• Is CBT effective for specific groups? (e.g. children with autism)
Which studies were included in the review? 
We searched the databases to find all studies of CBT for anxiety disorders in children and young people published up to October 2019. In order to be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) and had to include young people under 19 years of age with an anxiety disorder diagnosis. We included 87 studies with a total of 5964 participants in the analysis. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
We rated the overall quality of the evidence as 'moderate’ or 'low'. There is evidence that CBT is more effective than a waiting list or no treatment in reducing anxiety in children and young people, although the findings did vary across studies. There is no clear evidence that CBT is more effective than other treatments. A small number of studies looked at outcomes six months after CBT was given and showed that reductions in anxiety continued. We found no clear evidence that one way of providing CBT is more effective than another (e.g. in a group, longer treatments, with parents) or that CBT is more or less effective for any specific group of children (e.g. children with autism spectrum disorders). 
What should happen next? 
Future research should compare CBT to alternative treatments and medication; identify who does and does not benefit from CBT and what those who do not benefit need; establish how to make CBT more accessible; and give far more consideration to neglected populations, including children and young people from low‐ and middle‐income countries.

10.1002-14651858.CD010382.pub2,"Non‐drug management of breathing problems for children with severe physical and intellectual impairment 
Background For a variety of reasons, some children live with very severe intellectual and physical problems; they are unable to walk or talk and require a lot of care. In this study we refer to them as children with severe global developmental delay (SGDD); this is not a specific diagnosis but is rather an 'umbrella term' used to describe a group of children with similar problems. These children may have weak or stiff muscles and deformities of their skeleton; often they have problems with swallowing, resulting in food or saliva going into their lungs. Frequently they have a poor cough reflex and lack the strength required to expel secretions when they do cough. When we sleep, our breathing becomes shallower; for some children with SGDD whose breathing is already shallow when awake, falling asleep means that they do not breathe sufficiently deeply to take in enough oxygen and breathe out enough carbon dioxide. The consequence of these problems is that their respiratory system becomes weakened; they are more likely to develop chest infections, and relatively minor infections can make them very unwell. This can result in their spending a lot of time in hospital. This affects the quality of life for these children and families and is very expensive. Many types of treatment could help, but no good summary of studies has been prepared to tell healthcare professionals which treatments are best and when they should be used; this is the reason for this review. 
Review question The aim of our review was to discover how effective each type of treatment is for managing breathing problems in children with severe global developmental delay. As so many treatments are available, we decided to look only at treatments that do not involve drugs. 
Study characteristics We carried out a wide database search to look for studies of interventions for the management of breathing problems in children with severe neurological impairment. We found 15 studies of interest, which included a number of different types of treatment. 
Key results The results showed that several different treatments provided potential benefits, and for most interventions no serious adverse effects were reported. However, the quality of the studies was not good enough to inspire confidence in the findings. Night‐time positioning equipment and spinal bracing were shown to have a potentially negative effect in some participants. Although some studies looked at the same type of treatment, they used it in different ways or used different measures to assess effectiveness, so we could not put the results together. 
Quality of the evidence Of the 15 studies included here, only four used the 'gold standard' study design for health interventions. The remainder of the studies used less robust study designs, which limits the strength of the results. Further well‐designed randomised studies including larger numbers of participants are required to guide healthcare professionals to select the most effective treatments. 
This plain‐language summary is current to November 2013.  We updated searches in November 2019 and July 2020 and added six studies to awaiting classification, but these results have not been fully incorporated into the review.

Helping Children with Severe Health Problems Breathe Better Without Using Drugs

**Rationale**

Some children are born with or develop very serious problems with their bodies and brains. These children may not be able to walk or talk. They need a lot of care from their families and doctors.

These children often have weak muscles. This can make it hard for them to breathe well. Sometimes, food or spit can go down the wrong way into their lungs. This can be very dangerous. They may also have a weak cough. This means they cannot clear out mucus from their lungs easily.

When we sleep, we do not breathe as deeply. For these children, their breathing can become too low during sleep. They might not get enough of the good air, called oxygen. This can make their lungs weak over time.

Because of these problems, children can get sick with lung infections more often. A simple cold can become a serious illness for them. This can lead to many hospital visits, which is hard for the children and their families.

Doctors want to help these children breathe better. There are many treatments that do not use drugs. But we do not have good information about which treatments are the best. This study was done to look at all the past research on this topic. The goal was to find out which treatments work well and are safe.

**Trial Design**

This was not a study where children received a new treatment. Instead, the doctors did a review. This means they searched for and looked at studies that had already been done. They wanted to bring all the information together in one place.

The doctors looked for studies about treatments for breathing problems. They focused on studies that included children with severe problems in their brain and body. They only looked at treatments that did not use any drugs.

After a wide search, the doctors found 15 studies that fit what they were looking for. These 15 studies looked at a few different kinds of treatments to help with breathing.

**Results**

The review of the 15 studies found that some treatments might help children breathe better. For most of the treatments, there were no serious bad side effects reported. This is good news.

However, there was a big problem. The doctors who did the review found that the studies were not of high quality. This means we cannot be fully sure about their results. It is like getting advice from someone who is not an expert. You cannot trust the advice completely.

The review also found that some treatments could cause problems. Special pillows used to position a child at night and back braces may have had bad effects on some children. It is important for families and doctors to know about this risk.

It was also hard to compare the studies. Even when studies looked at the same type of treatment, they used it in different ways. They also measured if the treatment worked in different ways. This made it impossible for the doctors to combine the results to get one strong, clear answer.

The main conclusion is that we need better studies. Doctors need new studies that are very well-designed and include more children. This is the only way to get clear answers. This will help doctors and families choose the best and safest treatments to help these children live better and healthier lives.","Non‐drug management of breathing problems for children with severe physical and intellectual impairment 
Background For a variety of reasons, some children live with very severe intellectual and physical problems; they are unable to walk or talk and require a lot of care. In this study we refer to them as children with severe global developmental delay (SGDD); this is not a specific diagnosis but is rather an 'umbrella term' used to describe a group of children with similar problems. These children may have weak or stiff muscles and deformities of their skeleton; often they have problems with swallowing, resulting in food or saliva going into their lungs. Frequently they have a poor cough reflex and lack the strength required to expel secretions when they do cough. When we sleep, our breathing becomes shallower; for some children with SGDD whose breathing is already shallow when awake, falling asleep means that they do not breathe sufficiently deeply to take in enough oxygen and breathe out enough carbon dioxide. The consequence of these problems is that their respiratory system becomes weakened; they are more likely to develop chest infections, and relatively minor infections can make them very unwell. This can result in their spending a lot of time in hospital. This affects the quality of life for these children and families and is very expensive. Many types of treatment could help, but no good summary of studies has been prepared to tell healthcare professionals which treatments are best and when they should be used; this is the reason for this review. 
Review question The aim of our review was to discover how effective each type of treatment is for managing breathing problems in children with severe global developmental delay. As so many treatments are available, we decided to look only at treatments that do not involve drugs. 
Study characteristics We carried out a wide database search to look for studies of interventions for the management of breathing problems in children with severe neurological impairment. We found 15 studies of interest, which included a number of different types of treatment. 
Key results The results showed that several different treatments provided potential benefits, and for most interventions no serious adverse effects were reported. However, the quality of the studies was not good enough to inspire confidence in the findings. Night‐time positioning equipment and spinal bracing were shown to have a potentially negative effect in some participants. Although some studies looked at the same type of treatment, they used it in different ways or used different measures to assess effectiveness, so we could not put the results together. 
Quality of the evidence Of the 15 studies included here, only four used the 'gold standard' study design for health interventions. The remainder of the studies used less robust study designs, which limits the strength of the results. Further well‐designed randomised studies including larger numbers of participants are required to guide healthcare professionals to select the most effective treatments. 
This plain‐language summary is current to November 2013.  We updated searches in November 2019 and July 2020 and added six studies to awaiting classification, but these results have not been fully incorporated into the review.

Background 
Acute high altitude illness, also known as acute mountain sickness, may present with a variety of symptoms. It is caused by the decreasing level of oxygen at increasingly high altitudes; and it can be experienced when reaching a high altitude when travelling, hiking or climbing mountains or other elevated areas. People going to altitudes over 4000 metres, females, people younger than mid‐adulthood , and people with a history of migraine are at greater risk of suffering from altitude sickness. The most common symptoms are headache, loss of appetite , insomnia, and nausea. However, severe forms can include confusion, difficulty walking, progressive cough, shortness of breath, and even death. 
Review question 
What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for people suffering from high altitude illness? 
Study characteristics 
We included 13 studies with a total of 468 participants. Most studies included participants with mild or moderate forms of mountain sickness, and only one study included the severe neurological (disorder of the nervous system) form. Follow‐up was usually less than one day. We also identified two ongoing studies. 
Key results 
We found studies evaluating the following interventions: simulated descent with a hyperbaric chamber (medical use of oxygen in a special chamber at greater than atmospheric pressure to increase the availability of oxygen in the body); oxygen; medicines: acetazolamide, dexamethasone, ibuprofen, paracetamol, gabapentin, sumatriptan, nitric oxide, and magnesium sulphate. None of the studies reported the effects of these interventions on all‐cause mortality. The report of complete relief from acute mountain sickness symptoms, and adverse events was infrequent. Studies related to simulated descent with the use of a hyperbaric chamber did not find additional benefits or harms related to this intervention (3 studies, 124 participants). In addition, studies related to administration of medicines found some benefits in terms of reduction of symptoms with the use of acetazolamide (2 studies, 25 participants), and dexamethasone (1 study, 35 participants), without an increase in side effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence we found was low, and thus our certainty in the findings is limited. There was insufficient information on how the studies were conducted, and in some cases there was evidence of tampering at some stages of the trials. Furthermore, the number of persons in each study was very small (< 30 participants), and therefore the results were not clear (imprecise). Some studies were not blinded (that is, participants knew what experimental treatment they were receiving), and this could have affected how the participants evaluated their own symptoms.

A Look at a Study of Treatments for Mountain Sickness

**Rationale**

When people travel to high places like mountains, they can get sick. This is called high altitude illness or mountain sickness. It happens because there is less oxygen in the air the higher you go. Anyone can get it, but some people have a higher risk. This includes women, younger people, and people who get migraine headaches.

Mountain sickness can make you feel bad. Common signs are a headache, not feeling hungry, and feeling sick to your stomach. You may also have a hard time sleeping. In some people, the sickness can get very serious. It can cause confusion, trouble walking, and shortness of breath. It is important to find good treatments for mountain sickness.

Researchers wanted to know what treatments work best for mountain sickness. They also wanted to know if the treatments were safe. They looked at past studies to find answers. This information can help doctors and people who travel to high places.

**Trial Design**

This was not a new medical study. Instead, researchers looked at the results of 13 studies that were already done. This is called a review. By putting the results together, researchers hoped to get a clearer picture.

A total of 468 people were in these 13 studies. Most of them had mild to medium mountain sickness. Only one study looked at people with a severe sickness that affects the brain and nerves.

The studies were very short. After getting a treatment, people were checked on for less than one day. This means we only know about the short-term effects of the treatments.

**Results**

The researchers looked at several different treatments. These included breathing oxygen from a tank and using a special high-pressure oxygen chamber. They also looked at different medicines, like ibuprofen and dexamethasone.

Here is what the researchers found:
*   Using a special high-pressure oxygen chamber did not seem to have any extra benefits. It also did not seem to cause any harm.
*   Two medicines did seem to help. One was called acetazolamide. The other was called dexamethasone. They helped reduce the symptoms of mountain sickness. These medicines did not appear to cause more side effects.
*   None of the studies reported if the treatments helped prevent death.

The researchers said that we should be careful with these results. The proof from the studies was of low quality. This means we cannot be very sure that the treatments work as described.

There were a few reasons for this. The studies were very small. Most had fewer than 30 people. With so few people, it is hard to be sure of the results. Also, the way the studies were done was not always clear. In some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting. This could have changed how they reported their symptoms.

Because of these problems, the researchers concluded that we still do not have a clear answer. More and better studies are needed to find the best and safest ways to treat mountain sickness.","Treatments for high altitude (mountain) illness

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors (COX‐I) may prevent PDA‐related complications. Controversy exists on which COX‐I drug is the most effective and has the best safety profile in preterm infants. 
Objectives
To compare the effectiveness and safety of prophylactic COX‐I drugs and 'no COXI prophylaxis' in preterm infants using a Bayesian network meta‐analysis (NMA). 
Search methods
Searches of Cochrane CENTRAL via Wiley, OVID MEDLINE and Embase via Elsevier were conducted on 9 December 2021. We conducted independent searches of clinical trial registries and conference abstracts; and scanned the reference lists of included trials and related systematic reviews. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled preterm or low birth weight infants within the first 72 hours of birth without a prior clinical or echocardiographic diagnosis of PDA and compared prophylactic administration of indomethacin or ibuprofen or acetaminophen versus each other, placebo or no treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal. We used the GRADE NMA approach to assess the certainty of evidence derived from the NMA for the following outcomes: severe intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), mortality, surgical or interventional PDA closure, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), gastrointestinal perforation, chronic lung disease (CLD) and cerebral palsy (CP). 
Main results
We included 28 RCTs (3999 preterm infants). Nineteen RCTs (n = 2877) compared prophylactic indomethacin versus placebo/no treatment, 7 RCTs (n = 914) compared prophylactic ibuprofen versus placebo/no treatment and 2 RCTs (n = 208) compared prophylactic acetaminophen versus placebo/no treatment. Nine RCTs were judged to have high risk of bias in one or more domains.We identified two ongoing trials on prophylactic acetaminophen. 
Bayesian random‐effects NMA demonstrated that prophylactic indomethacin probably led to a small reduction in severe IVH (network RR 0.66, 95% Credible Intervals [CrI] 0.49 to 0.87; absolute risk difference [ARD] 43 fewer [95% CrI, 65 fewer to 16 fewer] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐3; moderate‐certainty), a moderate reduction in mortality (network RR 0.85, 95% CrI 0.64 to 1.1; ARD 24 fewer [95% CrI, 58 fewer to 16 more] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐4; moderate‐certainty) and surgical PDA closure (network RR 0.40, 95% CrI 0.14 to 0.66; ARD 52 fewer [95% CrI, 75 fewer to 30 fewer] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐2; moderate‐certainty) compared to placebo. Prophylactic indomethacin resulted in trivial difference in NEC (network RR 0.76, 95% CrI 0.35 to 1.2; ARD 16 fewer [95% CrI, 42 fewer to 13 more] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐3; high‐certainty), gastrointestinal perforation (network RR 0.92, 95% CrI 0.11 to 3.9; ARD 4 fewer [95% CrI, 42 fewer to 137 more] per 1000; median rank 1, 95% CrI 1‐3; moderate‐certainty) or CP (network RR 0.97, 95% CrI 0.44 to 2.1; ARD 3 fewer [95% CrI, 62 fewer to 121 more] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐3; low‐certainty) and may result in a small increase in CLD (network RR 1.10, 95% CrI 0.93 to 1.3; ARD 36 more [95% CrI, 25 fewer to 108 more] per 1000; median rank 3, 95% CrI 1‐3; low‐certainty). 
Prophylactic ibuprofen probably led to a small reduction in severe IVH (network RR 0.69, 95% CrI 0.41 to 1.14; ARD 39 fewer [95% CrI, 75 fewer to 18 more] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐4; moderate‐certainty) and moderate reduction in surgical PDA closure (network RR 0.24, 95% CrI 0.06 to 0.64; ARD 66 fewer [95% CrI, from 82 fewer to 31 fewer] per 1000; median rank 1, 95% CrI 1‐2; moderate‐certainty) compared to placebo. Prophylactic ibuprofen may result in moderate reduction in mortality (network RR 0.83, 95% CrI 0.57 to 1.2; ARD 27 fewer [95% CrI, from 69 fewer to 32 more] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐4; low‐certainty) and leads to trivial difference in NEC (network RR 0.73, 95% CrI 0.31 to 1.4; ARD 18 fewer [95% CrI, from 45 fewer to 26 more] per 1000; median rank 1, 95% CrI 1‐3; high‐certainty), or CLD (network RR 1.00, 95% CrI 0.83 to 1.3; ARD 0 fewer [95% CrI, from 61 fewer to 108 more] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐3; low‐certainty). The evidence is very uncertain on effect of ibuprofen on gastrointestinal perforation (network RR 2.6, 95% CrI 0.42 to 20.0; ARD 76 more [95% CrI, from 27 fewer to 897 more] per 1000; median rank 3, 95% CrI 1‐3; very low‐certainty). 
The evidence is very uncertain on the effect of prophylactic acetaminophen on severe IVH (network RR 1.17, 95% CrI 0.04 to 55.2; ARD 22 more [95% CrI, from 122 fewer to 1000 more] per 1000; median rank 4, 95% CrI 1‐4; very low‐certainty), mortality (network RR 0.49, 95% CrI 0.16 to 1.4; ARD 82 fewer [95% CrI, from 135 fewer to 64 more] per 1000; median rank 1, 95% CrI 1‐4; very low‐certainty), or CP (network RR 0.36, 95% CrI 0.01 to 6.3; ARD 70 fewer [95% CrI, from 109 fewer to 583 more] per 1000; median rank 1, 95% CrI 1‐3; very low‐certainty). 
In summary, based on ranking statistics, both indomethacin and ibuprofen were equally effective (median ranks 2 respectively) in reducing severe IVH and mortality. Ibuprofen (median rank 1) was more effective than indomethacin in reducing surgical PDA ligation (median rank 2). However, no statistically‐significant differences were observed between the COX‐I drugs for any of the relevant outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
Prophylactic indomethacin probably results in a small reduction in severe IVH and moderate reduction in mortality and surgical PDA closure (moderate‐certainty), may result in a small increase in CLD (low‐certainty) and results in trivial differences in NEC (high‐certainty), gastrointestinal perforation (moderate‐certainty) and cerebral palsy (low‐certainty). Prophylactic ibuprofen probably results in a small reduction in severe IVH and moderate reduction in surgical PDA closure (moderate‐certainty), may result in a moderate reduction in mortality (low‐certainty) and trivial differences in CLD (low‐certainty) and NEC (high‐certainty). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of acetaminophen on any of the clinically‐relevant outcomes.

Comparing Medicines to Prevent a Heart Problem in Premature Babies

### **Rationale**

**What is the health problem?**

Babies who are born too early are called premature babies. They can have special health problems. One common problem is with their heart.

Before a baby is born, a blood vessel near their heart is open. This vessel is called the ductus arteriosus. It should close on its own a few days after birth. In some premature babies, this blood vessel stays open. This is called a patent ductus arteriosus, or PDA. A PDA can cause serious problems. It can lead to trouble with breathing, gut problems, or even death.

**Why did we do this study?**

Doctors can give medicines to help this blood vessel close. This may prevent the serious problems caused by a PDA. Three common medicines are indomethacin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen.

Doctors are not sure which medicine is the best or safest for premature babies. This study was done to compare these three medicines. We wanted to see if they help prevent serious health problems. We also compared them to giving no medicine.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at past studies that were already completed. They found 28 studies that fit what they were looking for. They combined the results from all of them. This gives a stronger and more reliable answer than looking at just one study.

These studies included almost 4000 premature babies. The babies were all treated within the first three days of life. This was done to try to prevent a PDA from causing problems.

In the studies, some babies were given one of the three medicines. Other babies were given a placebo. A placebo is a dummy treatment, like a sugar pill. Some babies received no treatment at all. This helped researchers see if the real medicines made a difference.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

Researchers looked at several serious health problems. These included bleeding in the brain, long-term lung problems, serious gut problems, and the need for heart surgery. They also looked at how many babies died.

**What did we learn about indomethacin?**
Giving babies indomethacin seemed to help.
*   It likely lowered the chance of serious bleeding in the brain.
*   It likely lowered the number of babies who needed heart surgery to close the blood vessel.
*   It likely lowered the number of deaths.
*   It may have slightly raised the chance of a long-term lung problem.
*   It did not seem to cause gut problems.

**What did we learn about ibuprofen?**
Giving babies ibuprofen also seemed to help.
*   It likely lowered the chance of serious bleeding in the brain.
*   It was very good at lowering the number of babies who needed heart surgery.
*   It may have lowered the number of deaths.
*   It did not seem to cause lung or gut problems.

**What did we learn about acetaminophen?**
There was not much information about acetaminophen. The studies were too small. Researchers are very unsure if it helps or harms premature babies. We need more research to know for sure.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

Both indomethacin and ibuprofen seem to help prevent serious problems in premature babies. They both lower the risk of brain bleeds and death. Ibuprofen seems to be best at preventing the need for heart surgery.

This information can help doctors and families make better choices. They can decide if giving one of these medicines is the right thing to do for a premature baby. More research is still needed, especially for acetaminophen.","Prophylactic cyclo‐oxygenase inhibitor drugs to prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants 
 
Review question 
Among the available cyclo‐oxygenase inhibitor (COX‐I) drugs (indomethacin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen), which one is the safest and most effective in preventing death and poor outcomes in preterm infants when given prophylactically without the prior knowledge of the presence of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) within the first 72 hours after birth? 
Background 
A PDA is a common complication in preterm or low‐birth weight infants. PDA is an open vascular channel between the lungs and the heart which usually closes shortly after birth. In preterm infants, the PDA frequently remains open and may contribute to life‐threatening complications. COX‐I drugs such as indomethacin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen may prevent a PDA and related poor outcomes. Controversy exists on which of the three COX‐I drugs, if any, improves clinical outcomes in preterm infants. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases for randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) in preterm babies (born at less than 37 weeks into pregnancy) or low‐birthweight (weighing less than 2500 grams) infants where COX‐I drugs were given without the prior knowledge of the presence of a PDA, within the first 72 hours after birth. The included studies compared administration of indomethacin or ibuprofen or acetaminophen versus each other, placebo or no treatment.  
Key results 
This review of 28 clinical trials (3999 preterm infants) found that prophylactic indomethacin probably results in a small reduction in severe brain bleeding, a moderate reduction in death and need for PDA surgery, and may result in a small increase in chronic lung disease. Prophylactic indomethacin likely results in trivial differences in necrotizing enterocolitis, gastrointestinal perforation and cerebral palsy. Prophylactic ibuprofen probably results in a small reduction in severe brain bleeding and a moderate reduction in need for PDA surgery. Prophylactic ibuprofen may result in a moderate reduction in death and trivial differences in chronic lung disease and necrotizing enterocolitis. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of acetaminophen on any of the clinically relevant outcomes.There are currently two ongoing trials on prophylactic use of acetaminophen. 
Certainty of the evidence 
According to GRADE (a method to score the certainty of the trials supporting each outcome), the certainty of the evidence varied from very low to high but was moderate for the most important outcomes of severe brain bleeding and death. 
How up to date is the search evidence 
The search is up to date as of 9 December 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD006487.pub2,"Injectable local anaesthetic agents for preventing pain in participants requiring dental treatment 
Review question 
This review assessed the evidence for providing successful local anaesthesia that prevents pain during a dental procedure. Included studies compared injections of local anaesthetic to help people requiring dental treatment and to prevent painful sensations tested in an experimental way (such as using cold, a sharp probe, or an electric stimulus). 
Background 
An injection of local anaesthetic prevents a person from feeling pain. It is given in one specific area rather than in the whole body. Although pain during dental treatment can be successfully managed, it is a common fear of patients. 
Several different local anaesthetics are available to dentists, as well as a variety of ways to deliver them, to prevent pain. Factors that appear to influence success include increased difficulty in anaesthetizing teeth in the presence of inflammation, variable susceptibility of different teeth to local anaesthesia, different operative procedures performed on the tooth (for example, it appears easier to achieve successful anaesthesia for dental extractions than for root canal treatment), and various techniques and solutions used to give the local anaesthetic. 
We investigated whether injection of one local anaesthetic solution was more effective than another for preventing pain during dental treatment or during an experimental study, and whether this effect occurred quickly or lasted a sufficient length of time, if any unwanted effects occurred, and people’s experience of the dental procedures. Local adverse events might include pain during or after injection, or long‐lasting anaesthesia. Systemic effects due to the local anaesthetic solution can include allergic reactions and changes in heart rate and blood pressure. 
Study characteristics 
Two reviewers searched the literature to identify studies that compared different local anaesthetic solutions injected into people undergoing dental treatment or volunteers who had the same outcomes measured in experimental ways. Within every trial, each person was randomly assigned to receive one of the local anaesthetics under study. The search was up‐to‐date as of 31 January 2018. 
We found 123 trials with 19,223 male and female participants. These trials investigated pain experienced during dental treatment including surgery, extraction, periodontal (gum) treatment, tooth preparation, root canal treatment, anaesthesia of nerves within teeth (pulps) tested using an electric pulp tester or cold stimulant, and anaesthesia of soft tissues measured following pricking of gums or self‐reported by the participant. We pooled data from 68 studies (6615 participants). This resulted in eight outcomes when seven different local anaesthetic solutions were tested during dental treatment, two outcomes assessing pain during and after injection of local anaesthetic, and 47 outcomes tested with a pulp tester or by pricking of gums or self‐reported by participants. 
Key results 
The review suggests that of the 14 types of local anaesthetic tested, evidence to support the use of one over another is limited to the outcome of success (absence of pain), from three comparisons of local anaesthetic. Findings show that 4% articaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was superior to 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine in posterior teeth with inflamed pulps requiring root canal treatment. No difference between these solutions was seen when pain on injection was assessed, and although lidocaine resulted in less post‐injection pain, the difference was minimal. Researchers found that 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was superior to 3% prilocaine, 0.03 IU felypressin and 4% prilocaine plain for surgical procedures and surgical procedures/periodontal treatment, respectively. Speeds of onset were within clinically acceptable times, and durations were variable, making them suitable for different applications. Both of these latter outcomes were tested in experimental ways that may not reflect clinical findings. Unwanted effects were rare. Patients' experience of the procedures was not assessed owing to lack of data. 
Quality of the evidence 
From comparisons of local anaesthetics in this review, all appeared effective and safe with little difference between them. Available evidence ranged from moderate to very low in quality. Some studies fell short, in terms of quality, owing to small numbers of participants, unclear reporting of study methods, and reporting of data in a format that was not easy to combine with other data. Further research is required to clarify the effectiveness and safety of one local anaesthetic over another.

Which Numbing Shot Works Best to Prevent Pain During Dental Work?

### Rationale

Many people worry about feeling pain at the dentist. To prevent pain, dentists give a numbing shot in a small part of the mouth. This is called a local anesthetic. It keeps you from feeling pain in that one spot.

There are many different types of numbing medicines for dentists to use. Sometimes, it can be hard to get a tooth completely numb. This can happen if the tooth is very sore or swollen. It can also depend on the type of dental work you need.

This study looked at many different numbing shots. The researchers wanted to see if one medicine was better than another at stopping pain. They also checked if any of the shots caused unwanted side effects. This research is important to help dentists choose the best numbing medicine for each patient and each type of dental work.

### Trial Design

This was a review study. This means that researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they gathered and reviewed the results from many past studies. This helps them get a bigger and clearer picture of the topic.

The researchers found 123 different studies to review. These studies included over 19,000 men and women in total. The people in these studies were either getting dental work done or were healthy volunteers.

The dental work included tooth removal, gum treatments, and root canals. In the studies, each person was randomly chosen to get one type of numbing shot. The researchers then compared how well the different shots worked to prevent pain.

### Results

The review found that most of the numbing shots worked well and were safe. There were very few differences between most of them. However, researchers did find a few cases where one medicine worked better than another.

For root canals on sore back teeth, a medicine called articaine was better at stopping pain than a medicine called lidocaine. For dental surgery, lidocaine worked better than a medicine called prilocaine. These findings can help dentists make better choices for these specific treatments.

The study also looked at unwanted effects. Pain from getting the shot was about the same for the different medicines. Other unwanted effects, like an allergic reaction or changes in heart rate, were very rare.

The researchers concluded that while most numbing shots are effective, we need more research to know for sure which one is best for each situation. Some of the studies they looked at were small or did not have clear methods. Future studies can help give clearer answers for dentists and patients.","Injectable local anaesthetic agents for preventing pain in participants requiring dental treatment

This resulted in eight outcomes when seven different local anaesthetic solutions were tested during dental treatment, two outcomes assessing pain during and after injection of local anaesthetic, and 47 outcomes tested with a pulp tester or by pricking of gums or self‐reported by participants. 
Key results 
The review suggests that of the 14 types of local anaesthetic tested, evidence to support the use of one over another is limited to the outcome of success (absence of pain), from three comparisons of local anaesthetic. Findings show that 4% articaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was superior to 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine in posterior teeth with inflamed pulps requiring root canal treatment. No difference between these solutions was seen when pain on injection was assessed, and although lidocaine resulted in less post‐injection pain, the difference was minimal. Researchers found that 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was superior to 3% prilocaine, 0.03 IU felypressin and 4% prilocaine plain for surgical procedures and surgical procedures/periodontal treatment, respectively. Speeds of onset were within clinically acceptable times, and durations were variable, making them suitable for different applications. Both of these latter outcomes were tested in experimental ways that may not reflect clinical findings. Unwanted effects were rare. Patients' experience of the procedures was not assessed owing to lack of data. 
Quality of the evidence 
From comparisons of local anaesthetics in this review, all appeared effective and safe with little difference between them. Available evidence ranged from moderate to very low in quality. Some studies fell short, in terms of quality, owing to small numbers of participants, unclear reporting of study methods, and reporting of data in a format that was not easy to combine with other data. Further research is required to clarify the effectiveness and safety of one local anaesthetic over another.

What is Crohn's disease? 
Crohn’s disease is a long‐term condition that results in inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, occurring anywhere from the mouth to the anus. Common symptoms include fever, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and weight loss. Crohn's disease is characterized by periods of relapse when people are actively experiencing symptoms and periods of remission when the symptoms stop. 
What are Cannabis and Cannabinoids? 
Cannabis is a widely used drug which acts on the endocannabinoid system. Cannabis contains multiple components called cannabinoids. The use of cannabis and cannabis oil containing specific cannabinoids produces mental and physical effects such as altered sensory perception and euphoria when consumed. Some cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol, do not have a psychoactive effect. Cannabis and cannabidiol have some anti‐inflammatory properties that might help people with Crohn's disease. 
What did the researchers investigate? 
The researchers studied whether cannabis is better than placebo (e.g. a sugar pill) therapy for treating adults with active Crohn's disease or Crohn's disease that is in remission. 
What did the researchers find? 
The researchers extensively searched the literature up to 17 October 2018 and found three studies (93 participants) that met the inclusion criteria. One ongoing study was also identified. All of the studies were small in size and had some quality issues. One small study (21 participants) compared eight weeks of treatment with cannabis cigarettes containing 115 mg of D9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to placebo cigarettes containing cannabis with the THC removed in participants with active Crohn's disease who had failed at least one medical treatment. Although no difference in clinical remission rates was observed, more participants in the cannabis group had improvement in their Crohn's disease symptoms than participants in the placebo group. More side effects were observed in the cannabis cigarette group compared to placebo. These side effects were considered to be mild in nature and included sleepiness, nausea, difficulty with concentration, memory loss, confusion and dizziness. Participants in the cannabis cigarette group reported improvements in pain, appetite and satisfaction with treatment. 
One small study (22 participants) compared cannabis oil (10 mg of cannabidiol twice daily) to placebo oil (i.e. olive oil) in participants with active Crohn's disease who had failed at least one medical treatment. No difference in clinical remission rates was observed. There was no difference in serious side effects. Serious side effects included worsening Crohn's disease in one participant in each group. 
One small study (50 participants) compared cannabis oil (composed of 15% cannabidiol and 4% THC) to placebo oil in participants with active Crohn's disease. Positive differences in quality of life and the Crohn's disease activity index were observed. 
Conclusions 
The effects of cannabis and cannabis oil on Crohn's disease are uncertain. No firm conclusions regarding the benefits and harms (e.g. side effects) of cannabis and cannabis oil in adults with Crohn's disease can be drawn. The effects of cannabis and cannabis oil in people with Crohn's disease in remission have not been investigated. Further studies with larger numbers of participants are required to assess the potential benefits and harms of cannabis in Crohn's disease. Future studies should assess the effects of cannabis in people with active and inactive Crohn's disease. Different doses of cannabis and formulations (e.g. cannabis oil or pills) should be investigated.

Can Cannabis or Cannabis Oil Help People with Crohn's Disease?

**Rationale**
**What is Crohn’s disease?**
Crohn's disease is a long-term health problem. It causes parts of the gut to get red, sore, and swollen. The gut is the long tube in your body that helps you digest food. This swelling can cause belly pain, fever, and watery poop. It can also make people lose weight.

Symptoms of Crohn’s disease can come and go. When you feel sick and have symptoms, it is called a flare-up. When your symptoms go away, it is called remission. Living with Crohn’s disease can be hard.

**Why did researchers study cannabis?**
Researchers are looking for new ways to help people with Crohn's disease. Cannabis is a plant that has many parts. Some of these parts are called cannabinoids. Two well-known cannabinoids are THC and CBD.

Some research shows that cannabis may help reduce swelling in the body. Because Crohn's disease involves swelling in the gut, researchers wanted to see if cannabis could help. They wanted to know if cannabis works better than a placebo. A placebo is a fake treatment, like a sugar pill, that has no medicine in it.

**Trial Design**
**How was this review designed?**
Instead of doing a new study, researchers looked for all the studies that had already been done on this topic. They looked at studies finished before October 2018. They wanted to bring all the results together to get a better idea of what the science says.

The researchers found three small studies to review. In total, 93 adults with active Crohn's disease took part in these studies. Active Crohn’s disease means they were having symptoms. All of them had already tried other medicines that did not work.

Each study tested a different type of cannabis for about eight weeks.
*   One study looked at cannabis cigarettes with THC.
*   Another study looked at cannabis oil with CBD.
*   The last study looked at an oil with both THC and CBD.

**Results**
**What were the main results of the review?**
The researchers found that the effects of cannabis on Crohn’s disease are not clear. The studies they looked at were very small. This makes it hard to be sure about the results.

In the study that used cannabis cigarettes, cannabis did not help more people go into remission. Remission is when symptoms go away. But, people who used the cannabis cigarettes did say their symptoms got better. They felt less pain and had a better appetite. These people also had more side effects, like feeling sleepy, dizzy, or confused. The side effects were not serious.

In the study that used cannabis oil with only CBD, there was no real difference between the cannabis oil and the placebo oil. It did not seem to help people’s symptoms.

In the study that used an oil with both THC and CBD, people said they had a better quality of life. Their Crohn's disease symptoms also improved.

**What do these results mean?**
The researchers concluded that we still do not know for sure if cannabis or cannabis oil can help people with Crohn's disease. We also do not know enough about the bad effects.

Because the studies were so small, we cannot make strong conclusions. More research is needed to learn about the good and bad effects of cannabis for Crohn’s disease. Future studies should have more people in them. They should also test different amounts of cannabis and different ways of taking it, like in oils or pills.","Cannabis and cannabis oil for the treatment of Crohn's disease

Background Drugs to stimulate ovulation have been used to treat subfertility since the early 1960s. There is uncertainty about the safety of these drugs and their potential risk of causing cancer. Moreover, it has already been shown that infertility itself increases the risk of ovarian cancer.

### **Plain Title**

Do Drugs to Help Women Get Pregnant Raise the Risk of Ovarian Cancer?

### **Rationale**

Some women have a hard time getting pregnant. This is called subfertility. We know that women with subfertility may have a higher chance of getting ovarian cancer later in life. Ovarian cancer is a cancer that starts in the ovaries, which are the parts of a woman’s body that make eggs.

For many years, doctors have given women drugs to help them get pregnant. These drugs help the body release eggs. But people were worried about these drugs. They were not sure if taking them could also raise the risk of getting ovarian cancer.

Researchers wanted to find a clearer answer to this important question. They did this study to look at all the past research on this topic. They wanted to see if fertility drugs truly increase the risk of ovarian cancer.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, it was a large review of past studies. A review means that researchers gather the results from many different studies to find an overall answer.

The researchers looked at 37 different studies. These studies included information from over 4 million women. This large number of people helps make the results more reliable.

In this review, the researchers compared different groups of women. They looked at women with subfertility who took fertility drugs. They compared their risk of ovarian cancer to two other groups:
*   Women in the general population.
*   Women with subfertility who did not take any fertility drugs.

By comparing these groups, the researchers hoped to see if the drugs made a difference. The studies they looked at followed women for different amounts of time.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

Overall, the review did not find strong proof that fertility drugs increase the risk of ovarian cancer. The evidence was not clear enough to say that the drugs cause cancer.

Some older studies in the review did suggest a higher risk. For example, some studies from the USA showed a higher risk in women who took fertility drugs and had never given birth. Another very small study found that the risk for a certain type of non-cancer tumor was two times higher in women who used a fertility drug for more than four months. These are called borderline tumors. They are not cancer, but they can sometimes turn into cancer.

However, the researchers found that these older studies were not very high quality. They had some problems. For example, they did not follow women for a very long time. They also did not account for other things that can affect cancer risk. These other things are called risk factors.

**What are the conclusions?**

The researchers concluded that having subfertility is an important risk factor for ovarian cancer on its own. The link between fertility drugs and ovarian cancer is still not clear.

To get a better answer, future studies need to be stronger. They need to follow women for a much longer time. They also need to look at other important risk factors, such as:
*   A woman’s age and body weight.
*   If she has ever given birth.
*   If other people in her family have had ovarian cancer.
*   The specific reason why she has trouble getting pregnant.

Newer studies are already doing a better job of collecting this kind of information. This will help us get a much clearer answer in the future.","Is there an increased risk of ovarian cancer in women treated with drugs for subfertility?

10.1002-14651858.CD014328,"Background
Arthroscopic knee surgery remains a common treatment for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis, including for degenerative meniscal tears, despite guidelines strongly recommending against its use. This Cochrane Review is an update of a non‐Cochrane systematic review published in 2017. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of arthroscopic surgery, including debridement, partial menisectomy or both, compared with placebo surgery or non‐surgical treatment in people with degenerative knee disease (osteoarthritis, degenerative meniscal tears, or both). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers up to 16 April 2021, unrestricted by language. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), or trials using quasi‐randomised methods of participant allocation, comparing arthroscopic surgery with placebo surgery or non‐surgical interventions (e.g. exercise, injections, non‐arthroscopic lavage/irrigation, drug therapy, and supplements and complementary therapies) in people with symptomatic degenerative knee disease (osteoarthritis or degenerative meniscal tears or both). Major outcomes were pain, function, participant‐reported treatment success, knee‐specific quality of life, serious adverse events, total adverse events and knee surgery (replacement or osteotomy). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and the certainty of evidence using GRADE. The primary comparison was arthroscopic surgery compared to placebo surgery for outcomes that measured benefits of surgery, but we combined data from all control groups to assess harms and knee surgery (replacement or osteotomy). 
Main results
Sixteen trials (2105 participants) met our inclusion criteria. The average age of participants ranged from 46 to 65 years, and 56% of participants were women. Four trials (380 participants) compared arthroscopic surgery to placebo surgery. For the remaining trials, arthroscopic surgery was compared to exercise (eight trials, 1371 participants), a single intra‐articular glucocorticoid injection (one trial, 120 participants), non‐arthroscopic lavage (one trial, 34 participants), non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (one trial, 80 participants) and weekly hyaluronic acid injections for five weeks (one trial, 120 participants). The majority of trials without a placebo control were susceptible to bias: in particular, selection (56%), performance (75%), detection (75%), attrition (44%) and selective reporting (75%) biases. The placebo‐controlled trials were less susceptible to bias and none were at risk of performance or detection bias. Here we limit reporting to the main comparison, arthroscopic surgery versus placebo surgery. 
High‐certainty evidence indicates arthroscopic surgery leads to little or no difference in pain or function at three months after surgery, moderate‐certainty evidence indicates there is probably little or no improvement in knee‐specific quality of life three months after surgery, and low‐certainty evidence indicates arthroscopic surgery may lead to little or no difference in participant‐reported success at up to five years, compared with placebo surgery. 
Mean post‐operative pain in the placebo group was 40.1 points on a 0 to 100 scale (where lower score indicates less pain) compared to 35.5 points in the arthroscopic surgery group, a difference of 4.6 points better (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 better to 9 better; I2 = 0%; 4 trials, 309 participants). Mean post‐operative function in the placebo group was 75.9 points on a 0 to 100 rating scale (where higher score indicates better function) compared to 76 points in the arthroscopic surgery group, a difference of 0.1 points better (95% CI 3.2 worse to 3.4 better; I2 = 0%; 3 trials, 302 participants). 
Mean post‐operative knee‐specific health‐related quality of life in the placebo group was 69.7 points on a 0 to 100 rating scale (where higher score indicates better quality of life) compared with 75.3 points in the arthroscopic surgery group, a difference of 5.6 points better (95% CI 0.36 better to 10.68 better; I2 = 0%; 2 trials, 188 participants). We downgraded this evidence to moderate certainty as the 95% confidence interval does not rule in or rule out a clinically important change. 
After surgery, 74 out of 100 people reported treatment success with placebo and 82 out of 100 people reported treatment success with arthroscopic surgery at up to five years (risk ratio (RR) 1.11, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.86; I2 = 53%; 3 trials, 189 participants). We downgraded this evidence to low certainty due to serious indirectness (diversity in definition and timing of outcome measurement) and serious imprecision (small number of events). 
We are less certain if the risk of serious or total adverse events increased with arthroscopic surgery compared to placebo or non‐surgical interventions. Serious adverse events were reported in 6 out of 100 people in the control groups and 8 out of 100 people in the arthroscopy groups from eight trials (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.83; I2 = 47%; 8 trials, 1206 participants). Fifteen out of 100 people reported adverse events with control interventions, and 17 out of 100 people with surgery at up to five years (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.70; I2 = 48%; 9 trials, 1326 participants). The certainty of the evidence was low, downgraded twice due to serious imprecision (small number of events) and possible reporting bias (incomplete reporting of outcome across studies). Serious adverse events included death, pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis and deep infection. 
Subsequent knee surgery (replacement or high tibial osteotomy) was reported in 2 out of 100 people in the control groups and 4 out of 100 people in the arthroscopy surgery groups at up to five years in four trials (RR 2.63, 95% CI 0.94 to 7.34; I2 = 11%; 4 trials, 864 participants). The certainty of the evidence was low, downgraded twice due to the small number of events. 
Authors' conclusions
Arthroscopic surgery provides little or no clinically important benefit in pain or function, probably does not provide clinically important benefits in knee‐specific quality of life, and may not improve treatment success compared with a placebo procedure. It may lead to little or no difference, or a slight increase, in serious and total adverse events compared to control, but the evidence is of low certainty. Whether or not arthroscopic surgery results in slightly more subsequent knee surgery (replacement or osteotomy) compared to control remains unresolved.

Does a Common Knee Surgery Help People with Knee Pain from Wear and Tear?

### **Rationale**

Many people have knee pain that gets worse over time. This is often caused by “wear and tear” on the knee joint. In your knee, a soft cushion called cartilage helps the bones move smoothly. Over time, this cushion can wear down. This condition is called osteoarthritis. It can cause pain, stiffness, and make it hard to move.

A common treatment for this knee pain is a surgery. Doctors use a small camera and tools to look inside the knee. They may clean up or remove damaged parts. This is called arthroscopic surgery.

Even though this surgery is common, experts are not sure if it really helps people feel better. Researchers wanted to find out if this surgery works better than other options. They looked at the results of many past studies to get a clear answer. This study is important to help doctors and patients make the best choices for treating knee pain.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of 16 past studies. Bringing together results from many studies like this is called a review. A review can give a stronger answer than just one study alone.

The studies included over 2,000 people. The people in the studies were between 46 and 65 years old. A little more than half of them were women. All of them had knee pain from wear and tear.

In these studies, people were put into groups by chance. Some people had the real knee surgery. Other people had a fake surgery, called a placebo. A fake surgery is used to see if the real surgery truly works better than just thinking you had a surgery. Some studies also compared the real surgery to other treatments, like exercise or pain shots. The studies checked on people for up to five years after their treatment.

### **Results**

The researchers found that the knee surgery did not provide much benefit for patients.

When they compared the real surgery to the fake surgery, they found:

*   **Pain and Movement:** People who had the real surgery did not have much less pain than those who had the fake surgery. How well their knee could move and work was also about the same. The differences were very small and not likely to be noticed by a patient.
*   **Quality of Life:** The surgery did not seem to improve people’s quality of life in a meaningful way.
*   **Side Effects:** The study also looked at harms, or side effects. About 8 out of 100 people who had the surgery had a serious side effect. This was compared to 6 out of 100 people who did not have the surgery. Serious side effects included things like blood clots or a bad infection. The researchers were not very sure about this finding.
*   **Need for More Surgery:** The review also looked at how many people needed another knee surgery later, like a knee replacement. About 4 out of 100 people who had the first surgery needed another one. This was compared to 2 out of 100 people in the groups that did not have surgery.

In conclusion, the researchers found strong proof that this common knee surgery offers little to no real benefit for pain or movement. The results of this review suggest that arthroscopic surgery may not be a good choice for most people with knee pain from wear and tear.","Arthroscopic surgery for degenerative knee disease
Background 
Degenerative knee disease (osteoarthritis in the knee which affects the joint lining and menisci) is the most common cause of knee pain, swelling and stiffness in the knee joint which leads to difficulty in walking. The cartilage in the knee joint is damaged, resulting in friction in the joint surfaces and formation of new bone in severe cases. Arthroscopic knee surgery removes damaged cartilage and loose tissue and smooths the knee joint surfaces. 
Study characteristics 
We included 16 randomised trials (2105 participants) published up to 16 April 2021. Trials were conducted in Canada, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Norway, Pakistan, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Netherlands and USA. 
Overall, 56% of participants were women. The average age of participants ranged from 46 to 65 years and the average duration of symptoms ranged from 1.6 months to 4.4 years. Of the nine trials reporting their funding source, none received funding from industry. The other seven trials did not report any funding source. 
We limit reporting to the main comparison, arthroscopic surgery versus placebo (dummy or sham) surgery. 
Key results 
Compared with placebo surgery, arthroscopic surgery had little benefit:
Pain (lower scores mean less pain) 
Improvement in pain was 4.6 points better (0.02 better to 9 better) on a 0 to 100 point scale with arthroscopic surgery than with placebo, 3 months after surgery. 
• People who had arthroscopic surgery rated their post‐operative pain as 35.5 points.
• People who had placebo surgery rated their post‐operative pain as 40.1 points.
Knee function (higher scores mean better function) 
Improvement in knee function was 0.1 points better (3.2 worse to 3.4 better) on a 0 to 100 point scale with arthroscopic surgery than with placebo, 3 months after surgery. 
• People who had arthroscopic surgery rated their post‐operative knee function as 76.0 points. 
• People who had placebo surgery rated their post‐operative knee function as 75.9 points. 
Knee‐specific quality of life (higher scores mean better quality of life) 
Improvement in knee‐specific quality of life was 5.6 points better (0.4 better to 10.7 better) on a 0 to 100 point scale with arthroscopic surgery than with placebo, 3 months after surgery. 
• People who had arthroscopic surgery rated their post‐operative quality of life as 75.3 points. 
• People who had placebo surgery rated their post‐operative quality of life as 69.7 points. 
Treatment success (rated by participants) 
8% more people rated their treatment a success (25% fewer to 63% more), or 8 more people out of 100, at up to 5 years after surgery. 
• 82 out of 100 people reported treatment success with arthroscopic surgery.
• 74 out of 100 people reported treatment success with placebo surgery.
Serious adverse events 
2% more people (2% fewer to 10% more) had serious adverse events, or 2 more people out of 100, at up to 5 years after surgery. 
• 8 out of 100 people reported serious adverse events with arthroscopic surgery.
• 6 out of 100 people reported serious adverse events with placebo surgery.
Total adverse events 
2% more people (3% fewer to 11% more), had adverse events, or 2 more people out of 100, at up to 5 years after surgery. 
• 17 out of 100 people reported adverse events with arthroscopic surgery.
• 15 out of 100 people reported adverse events with placebo surgery.
Subsequent knee surgery 
2% more people (0.1% fewer to 9% more), had subsequent knee surgery, or 2 more people out of 100, at up to 5 years. 
• 4 out of 100 people had knee replacement or osteotomy (knee surgery that reshapes bone) with arthroscopic surgery. 
• 2 out of 100 people had knee replacement or osteotomy with placebo surgery.
Certainty of the evidence 
We are confident that knee arthroscopy does not provide any clinically important benefits in terms of pain and function. We are moderately confident that knee arthroscopy probably does not provide any clinically important benefits in knee‐specific quality of life over a placebo procedure. Knee arthroscopy may not increase participant‐reported success compared with placebo. We have little confidence in the evidence because of differences across trials in reporting success and the small number of events. We are less certain of the risk of serious and total adverse events in arthroscopy versus placebo surgery: the evidence was uncertain because of the small number of events and incomplete reporting of study information. 
Adverse events associated with surgery include total knee replacement, osteotomy, repeat arthroscopy, arthroscopy in opposite knee, cutaneous nerve lesion (damage to nerves in the skin), deep or superficial infection, general knee pain, swelling, instability, stiffness or decreased range of motion in the affected or opposite knee, haemarthrosis (bleeding into the knee joint), death, acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), hypoxaemia (decreased oxygen in the blood), deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the deep veins), tendonitis (inflammation of tendons), pain from fall or other trauma, rupture of a Baker's cyst (a fluid‐filled sac behind the knee), and back or hip or foot pain. 
Arthroscopic surgery may or may not lead to slightly more subsequent knee surgery (replacement or osteotomy) than the placebo procedure.

Background 
Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cause of death, accounting for 50,000 to 200,000 deaths annually. It is the third most common cause of mortality among the cardiovascular diseases, after coronary artery disease and stroke. The advent of multi‐detector computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has allowed better assessment of PE regarding visualisation of the peripheral pulmonary arteries, increasing its rate of diagnosis. More cases of peripheral PEs, such as isolated subsegmental PE (SSPE) and incidental PE, have thereby been identified. These two conditions are usually found in patients with few or no classic symptoms such as coughing (including coughing up blood), chest or upper back pain, acute shortness of breath, or general or specific failure of the circulation that is either cardiac or peripheral in nature. However, in patients with an impaired cardiac and pulmonary condition the classic PE symptoms can be found with isolated SSPEs. Incidental SSPE is found casually in asymptomatic patients, usually by diagnostic imaging performed for other reasons (for example routine computed tomography (CT) for cancer staging in oncologic patients).

Are Blood Thinners Needed for Small Blood Clots in the Lungs?

### **Rationale**

A blood clot in the lungs is a serious health problem. Doctors call it a pulmonary embolism. These clots can stop blood from flowing freely in the lungs. For many people, this can be very dangerous. It is one of the top three causes of death from heart and blood vessel problems.

Newer body scans can now find very small blood clots in the lungs. Because of this, doctors are finding more of these small clots than before. Sometimes, doctors find these clots by chance when a person gets a scan for another reason, like for cancer.

People with these small clots often do not have symptoms. They may not have chest pain or feel short of breath. This has made doctors ask an important question: Are these small clots harmful? Do they need to be treated with medicine?

The main treatment for blood clots is a type of medicine called a blood thinner. Blood thinners help stop clots from getting bigger and prevent new ones. But these medicines also have risks, like causing too much bleeding. This review of studies was done to find out if using blood thinners is helpful and safe for people with small blood clots in their lungs.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked for studies that had already been done. Their goal was to gather all the best research on this topic. They wanted to combine the results to get a clear answer about using blood thinners for small lung clots.

The researchers were looking for a special type of study. In these studies, people are put into groups by chance. One group gets a treatment, like a blood thinner. The other group gets no treatment or a fake treatment. This is the best way to see if a treatment really works and is safe.

The researchers searched for studies about adults who had small blood clots in their lungs. The goal was to compare the health of people who took blood thinners to those who did not. This would help them understand the benefits and risks of the treatment.

### **Results**

The researchers carefully looked for studies on this topic up to November 2019. After searching, they found no studies that matched what they were looking for.

This means there is no strong proof to help doctors and patients decide what to do. We still do not know if using blood thinners for small lung clots helps people more than it might harm them. We cannot say if the benefits of the medicine are greater than the risks of bleeding.

Because no studies were found, the researchers could not answer their main question. They concluded that new research is needed to find the answer. Well-done studies will help doctors give the best advice. Until then, doctors must work with each patient to decide on the best plan for their care.","Anticoagulant treatment for subsegmental pulmonary embolism

10.1002-14651858.CD014962,"Background
Remdesivir is an antiviral medicine with properties to inhibit viral replication of SARS‐CoV‐2. Positive results from early studies attracted media attention and led to emergency use authorisation of remdesivir in COVID‐19.  A thorough understanding of the current evidence regarding the effects of remdesivir as a treatment for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection based on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is required. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of remdesivir compared to placebo or standard care alone on clinical outcomes in hospitalised patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and to maintain the currency of the evidence using a living systematic review approach. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register (which comprises the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and medRxiv) as well as Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded and Emerging Sources Citation Index) and WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions. We conducted the searches on 16 April 2021. 
Selection criteria
We followed standard Cochrane methodology.
We included RCTs evaluating remdesivir for the treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in hospitalised adults compared to placebo or standard care alone irrespective of disease severity, gender, ethnicity, or setting.  
We excluded studies that evaluated remdesivir for the treatment of other coronavirus diseases. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodology.
To assess risk of bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for outcomes that were reported according to our prioritised categories: all‐cause mortality at up to day 28, duration to liberation from invasive mechanical ventilation, duration to liberation from supplemental oxygen, new need for mechanical ventilation (high‐flow oxygen, non‐invasive, or invasive mechanical ventilation), new need for invasive mechanical ventilation, new need for non‐invasive mechanical ventilation or high‐flow oxygen, new need for oxygen by mask or nasal prongs, quality of life, serious adverse events, and adverse events (any grade). 
Main results
We included five RCTs with 7452 participants diagnosed with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and a mean age of 59 years, of whom 3886 participants were randomised to receive remdesivir. Most participants required low‐flow oxygen (n=4409) or mechanical ventilation (n=1025) at baseline. Studies were mainly conducted in high‐ and upper‐middle‐income countries. We identified two ongoing studies, one was suspended due to a lack of COVID‐19 patients to recruit. 
Risk of bias assessments were considered to be some concerns or high risk for clinical status and safety outcomes because participants who had died did not contribute information to these outcomes. Without adjustment, this leads to an uncertain amount of missing values and the potential for bias due to missing data. 
Effects of remdesivir in hospitalised individuals  
Remdesivir probably makes little or no difference to all‐cause mortality at up to day 28 (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.06; risk difference (RD) 8 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 21 fewer to 7 more; 4 studies, 7142 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  There was limited evidence for a beneficial effect of remdesivir on mortality in a subset of 435 participants who received low flow oxygen at baseline in one study (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.66). We could not confirm this finding due to restricted availability of relevant subgroup data from other studies. 
Remdesivir may have little or no effect on the duration to liberation from invasive mechanical ventilation (2 studies, 1298 participants, data not pooled, low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether remdesivir increases or decreases the chance of clinical improvement in terms of duration to liberation from supplemental oxygen at up to day 28 (3 studies, 1691 participants, data not pooled, very low‐certainty evidence).   
We are very uncertain whether remdesivir decreases or increases the risk of clinical worsening in terms of new need for mechanical ventilation at up to day 28 (high‐flow oxygen or non‐invasive ventilation or invasive mechanical ventilation) (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.24; RD 29 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 68 fewer to 32 more; 3 studies, 6696 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); new need for non‐invasive mechanical ventilation or high‐flow oxygen (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.98; RD 72 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 118 fewer to 5 fewer; 1 study, 573 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); and new need for oxygen by mask or nasal prongs (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.22; RD 84 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 204 fewer to 98 more; 1 study, 138 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Remdesivir may decrease the risk of clinical worsening in terms of new need for invasive mechanical ventilation (67 fewer participants amongst 1000 participants; RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.77; 2 studies, 1159 participants; low‐certainty evidence).  
None of the included studies reported quality of life.
Remdesivir probably decreases the serious adverse events rate at up to 28 days (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.90; RD 63 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 94 fewer to 25 fewer; 3 studies, 1674 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain whether remdesivir increases or decreases adverse events rate (any grade) (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27; RD 29 more per 1000, 95% CI 82 fewer to 158 more; 3 studies, 1674 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Based on the currently available evidence remdesivir probably has little or no effect on all‐cause mortality at up to 28 days in hospitalised adults with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. We are uncertain about the effects of remdesivir on clinical improvement and worsening. There were insufficient data available to examine the effect of remdesivir on mortality across subgroups defined by respiratory support at baseline.  
Future studies should provide additional data on efficacy and safety of remdesivir for defined core outcomes in COVID‐19 research, especially for different population subgroups. This could allow us to draw more reliable conclusions on the potential benefits and harms of remdesivir in future updates of this review. Due to the living approach of this work, we will update the review periodically.

### **Plain Title**

Does the drug remdesivir help people in the hospital with COVID-19? A review of the research.

### **Rationale**

COVID-19 is a sickness caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. This virus can make people very sick. Some people need to go to the hospital for treatment.

Researchers wanted to find drugs to fight this virus. One drug is called remdesivir. It is an antiviral drug. This means it is made to stop viruses from making more copies of themselves. Early news reports said remdesivir might help people with COVID-19. Because of this, some doctors started using it.

But doctors needed to be sure if the drug really worked and if it was safe. The best way to know is to look at all the high-quality research at once. So, a group of researchers decided to review all the best studies. They wanted to combine the results to get a clear answer. This review looked at whether remdesivir helped people in the hospital with COVID-19.

### **Trial Design**

This was a review study. This means the researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they gathered and studied the results from other studies that were already finished. This helps to get a stronger answer than just one study can give.

The researchers looked for a special type of study. These studies are called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, patients are put into groups by chance. One group gets the real drug, like remdesivir. The other group gets the usual hospital care or a fake treatment, called a placebo. This design is the best way to see if a new treatment truly works.

This review included 5 studies. In total, these studies had about 7,500 adults who were in the hospital with COVID-19. The average age of the people in the studies was 59 years. The researchers compared the results for the people who got remdesivir to those who did not. They looked at what happened to the patients for up to 28 days.

### **Results**

Here is what the researchers found after looking at all the studies together.

**Did remdesivir help people live longer?**
Remdesivir probably makes little or no difference in the number of people who died from COVID-19. For every 1,000 people treated, there might be 8 fewer deaths. But there could also be 7 more deaths. The evidence was not clear enough to say for sure that it saved lives.

**Did remdesivir help people get better faster?**
The researchers were not sure if remdesivir helped people get better. They looked at how long it took for people to get off a breathing machine. They also looked at how long people needed extra oxygen. The studies did not give a clear answer on whether the drug helped with these things.

**Did remdesivir stop people from getting sicker?**
Researchers were also not sure if remdesivir stopped people’s illness from getting worse. For example, they were not sure if it stopped people from needing a breathing machine. There was some sign that it might help avoid the need for the most serious type of breathing machine, which uses a tube down the throat. Out of 1,000 people, 67 fewer may have needed this kind of help. But the evidence for this was not very strong.

**Was remdesivir safe?**
Remdesivir probably caused fewer serious side effects. For every 1,000 people who got the drug, 63 fewer had a serious health problem. For mild side effects, the researchers were not sure if the drug caused more or fewer problems.

**What did the researchers conclude?**
Based on all the studies they reviewed, the researchers concluded that remdesivir probably does not reduce the number of deaths in adults hospitalized with COVID-19. They are also uncertain if the drug helps patients get better or stops them from getting worse. More studies are needed to understand if remdesivir might help certain groups of patients. The researchers will keep updating this review as new studies are published.","Remdesivir to treat people with COVID‐19
Is remdesivir (an antiviral medicine) an effective treatment for COVID‐19? 
Key messages 
• For adults hospitalised with COVID‐19, remdesivir probably has little or no effect on deaths from any cause up to 28 days after treatment compared with placebo (sham treatment) or usual care.  
• We are uncertain whether remdesivir improves or worsens patients’ condition, based on whether they needed more or less help with breathing. 
• Researchers should agree on key outcomes to be used in COVID‐19 research, and future studies should investigate these areas. This would allow future updates of this review to draw more certain conclusions about the use of remdesivir to treat COVID‐19. 
What is remdesivir? 
Remdesivir is a medicine that fights viruses. It has been shown to prevent the virus that causes COVID‐19 (SARS‐CoV‐2) from reproducing. Medical regulators have approved remdesivir for emergency use to treat people with COVID‐19.  
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know if remdesivir is an effective treatment for people in hospital with COVID‐19 and if it causes unwanted effects compared to placebo or usual care. 
People with COVID‐19 are given different kinds of breathing support, depending on how severe their breathing difficulties are. We used the types of breathing support people received as a measure of the success of remdesivir in treating COVID‐19. Types of breathing support included: 
• for severe breathing difficulties: invasive mechanical ventilation, when a breathing tube is put into patients’ lungs, and a machine (ventilator) breathes for them. Patients are given medicine to make them sedated whilst they are on a ventilator. 
• for moderate to severe breathing difficulties: non‐invasive mechanical ventilation through a mask over the nose and/or mouth, or a helmet. Air or oxygen is pushed through the mask. Patients are generally awake for this treatment. 
• for moderate breathing difficulties: oxygen via a mask or prongs that sit in the nostrils. Patients can still breathe room air. 
We were interested in the following outcomes:
• deaths from any cause in the 28 days after treatment;
• whether patients got better after treatment, measured by how long they spent on mechanical ventilation or oxygen; 
• whether patients’ condition worsened so that they needed oxygen or mechanical ventilation;
• quality of life;
• any unwanted effects; and 
• serious unwanted effects.
What did we do?  
We searched for studies that investigated remdesivir to treat adults with COVID‐19 compared to placebo or standard care. Patients were hospitalised with COVID‐19 and could be of any gender or ethnicity.   
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find?  
We found 5 studies with 7452 people hospitalised with COVID‐19. Of these, 3886 people were given remdesivir. The average age of patients was 59 years. Studies took place around the world, mainly in high‐ and upper‐middle‐income countries.  
Main results  
The included studies compared remdesivir to placebo or usual care in people hospitalised with COVID‐19 for up to 28 days. 
Deaths from any cause 
• Remdesivir probably makes little or no difference to deaths from any cause (4 studies, 7142 people). In 1000 people, 8 fewer die with remdesivir compared to placebo or standard care. 
Did patients get better with remdesivir? 
• Remdesivir may have little or no effect on the length of time patients spent on invasive mechanical ventilation (2 studies, 1298 people).  
• We do not know whether remdesivir increases or decreases time on supplemental oxygen (3 studies, 1691 people). 
Did patients get worse with remdesivir? 
• We do not know whether patients are more or less likely to need any mechanical ventilation (invasive or non‐invasive) with remdesivir (3 studies, 6696 people). 
• Patients may be less likely to need invasive mechanical ventilation (2 studies, 1159 people). 
• We do not know whether patients are more or less likely to need non‐invasive mechanical ventilation (1 study, 573 people).  
• We do not know whether patients are more or less likely to need oxygen by mask or nasal prongs (1 study, 138 people). 
Quality of life 
• None of the included studies reported quality of life.
Unwanted effects 
• We do not know whether remdesivir leads to more or fewer unwanted effects of any level (3 studies, 1674 people).  
• Patients are probably less likely to experience serious unwanted effects with remdesivir than with placebo or standard care (3 studies, 1674 people). In 1000 people, 63 fewer would experience a serious unwanted effect compared to placebo or standard care. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We are moderately confident in the evidence for deaths from any cause and serious unwanted effects; however, our confidence in the other evidence is limited because studies used different methods to measure and record their results, and we did not find many studies for some of our outcomes of interest.  
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
The evidence is current to 16 April 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD011082.pub2,"Antimicrobial dressings attached to the central venous catheters in reducing catheter‐related infections in newborn infants 
Review question: In newborn infants who require a central venous catheter, does the use of antiseptic or antibiotic catheter dressing, compared to no dressing, reduce catheter‐related infections? 
Background: Central venous catheters (CVCs) are small tubes inserted into the vein to give fluids, medication and intravenous nutrition to sick patients. The risks of CVCs are well‐known, and can cause infections, which may result in death or serious illnesses. Newborn infants are vulnerable, as they on the one hand require the CVCs to sustain life, and on the other hand are at high risks of the complications, due to their thin skin and poorly‐developed immune system. 
Several measures have been developed to reduce infections in newborn infants. These include hand hygiene for caregivers, skin cleaning for the infants, antibiotics and modification of the catheters including the use of antiseptic or antibiotic‐coated catheter dressing or patch that could be placed on the skin at the CVC insertion site. While promising, these measures need on‐going evaluation. In this review, we synthesized up‐to‐date evidence on the effectiveness and safety of antiseptic or antibiotic dressing as a part of CVC care in sick newborn infants. 
Search date: We performed a search in multiple medical databases in September 2015. 
Study characteristics: Three studies (total participants: 855) fit our inclusion criteria. There were two main comparisons: i) chlorhexidine dressing and alcohol skin cleansing against standard polyurethane dressing and povidone‐iodine skin cleansing (from one large study), and ii) silver‐alginate patch against a control group without patch (from two smaller studies). The quality of the included studies are high, except that the people closely involved in the trials such as the care personnel were not masked from knowing whether or not the infants in the study were given antiseptic or antibiotic dressing, which might have affected their recording or interpretation of the results. 
Study funding sources: One of the studies was funded in part by Johnson and Johnson Medical; Children's Foundation; Children's Hospital, Milwaukee and National Institutes of Health. Another study was funded by the Vanderbilt NICU Research Fund. Funding source was not stated in the third study. 
Key results: In our main findings, chlorhexidine dressing/alcohol skin cleansing made no difference to catheter‐related blood stream infection (CRBSI) and blood stream infection (""sepsis"") without an identifiable source, although it significantly reduced the chance of micro‐organisms lodging in the CVCs (""catheter colonisation""), with an average of 9% reduction in risk among newborn infants with a baseline risk of 24% (1 study, 655 infants). However, infants who received chlorhexidine dressing/alcohol skin cleansing were more likely to develop skin irritation (""contact dermatitis""), as 19 out of 335 infants (5.7%) in the chlorhexidine group developed this complication compared to none in the group that received standard dressing/povidone‐iodine cleansing. However, it was unclear whether the dressing or the alcohol solution was mainly responsible for the skin irritation, as the other group did not use alcohol solution for skin cleansing. In the other comparison, silver‐alginate patch made no overall differences in CRBSI and mortality compared to no dressing, neither did it cause any adverse reaction. 
Quality of the evidence: There was moderate‐quality evidence for all the major outcomes. The major factor that affected the quality of evidence was the lack of precision in the result estimates, as the calculated plausible range of the effects (the 95% confidence intervals) were wide. 
Conclusions: Chlorhexidine CVC dressing with alcohol skin cleansing posed a high risk of skin irritation against a modest reduction in catheter colonisation. For silver‐alginate patch, evidence is still insufficient for a clear picture of benefit an harm. We have made recommendations for future research that evaluate these interventions.

Do Special Dressings Help Prevent Infections in Newborns with IV Lines?

**Rationale**

Very sick newborn babies sometimes need a special, small tube put into a large vein. This tube is called a central venous catheter, or CVC. Doctors use this tube to give the baby food, fluids, and medicine to help them get better.

While these tubes can save lives, they can also cause problems. Germs can get into the body where the tube enters the skin. This can cause a serious blood infection. Newborn babies are at a high risk for these infections. Their skin is very thin, and their bodies are not yet strong enough to fight off germs well.

Researchers wanted to know if a special kind of dressing, or patch, could help. These dressings have germ-killing medicine in them. The idea was that putting these dressings on the skin where the tube goes in could stop infections before they start. This study looked at past research to see if these special dressings are safe and if they work for newborn babies.

**Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked for and combined the results of other studies that were already done. This is called a review.

The researchers found three studies that included a total of 855 newborn babies. The babies in these studies all needed a CVC tube.

The studies looked at two different types of special dressings:
*   One large study looked at a dressing with a medicine called chlorhexidine. It compared babies who got this dressing to babies who got a standard, plain dressing.
*   Two smaller studies looked at a patch with silver in it. It compared babies who got the silver patch to babies who got no patch at all.

**Results**

Here is what the researchers found from the studies.

For the dressing with chlorhexidine medicine:
*   It did **not** reduce the number of serious blood infections.
*   It **did** reduce the number of germs that grew on the outside of the tube.
*   However, this dressing caused skin problems for some babies. About 6 out of every 100 babies who used this dressing got a skin rash or irritation. No babies who used the standard dressing got a rash.

For the silver patch:
*   It did **not** reduce the number of serious blood infections.
*   It did **not** change the number of deaths.
*   The silver patch did not seem to cause any bad side effects or skin problems.

In the end, the researchers concluded that the chlorhexidine dressing was not a good choice for newborn babies. The risk of getting a painful skin rash was too high for the small benefit it offered. For the silver patch, the researchers said there is not enough information yet. It is hard to say if the silver patch helps or not. More research is needed to find the best way to keep these tiny babies safe from infection.","Antimicrobial dressings attached to the central venous catheters in reducing catheter‐related infections in newborn infants

Conclusions: Chlorhexidine CVC dressing with alcohol skin cleansing posed a high risk of skin irritation against a modest reduction in catheter colonisation. For silver‐alginate patch, evidence is still insufficient for a clear picture of benefit an harm. We have made recommendations for future research that evaluate these interventions.

Germinal matrix‐intraventricular haemorrhage (GMH‐IVH) remains a substantial issue in neonatal intensive care units worldwide. Current therapies to prevent or treat GMH‐IVH are limited. Stem cell‐based therapies offer a potential therapeutic approach to repair, restore, and/or regenerate injured brain tissue. These preclinical findings have now culminated in ongoing human neonatal studies. 
Objectives
To determine the benefits and harms of stem cell‐based interventions for prevention or treatment of germinal matrix‐intraventricular haemorrhage (GM‐IVH) in preterm infants. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 1), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 7 January 2019); Embase (1980 to 7 January 2019); and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to 7 January 2019). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials. 
Selection criteria
We attempted to identify randomised controlled trials, quasi‐randomised controlled trials, and cluster trials comparing (1) stem cell‐based interventions versus control; (2) mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) of type or source versus MSCs of other type or source; (3) stem cell‐based interventions other than MSCs of type or source versus stem cell‐based interventions other than MSCs of other type or source; or (4) MSCs versus stem cell‐based interventions other than MSCs. For prevention studies, we included extremely preterm infants (less than 28 weeks' gestation), 24 hours of age or less, without ultrasound diagnosis of GM‐IVH; for treatment studies, we included preterm infants (less than 37 weeks' gestation), of any postnatal age, with ultrasound diagnosis of GM‐IVH. 
Data collection and analysis
For each of the included trials, two review authors independently planned to extract data (e.g. number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, type and source of MSCs, other stem cell‐based interventions) and assess the risk of bias (e.g. adequacy of randomisation, blinding, completeness of follow‐up). Primary outcomes considered in this review are all‐cause neonatal mortality, major neurodevelopmental disability, GM‐IVH, and extension of pre‐existing non‐severe GM‐IVH. We planned to use the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
Our search strategy yielded 769 references. We did not find any completed studies for inclusion. One randomised controlled trial is currently registered and ongoing. Five phase 1 trials are described in the excluded studies. 
Authors' conclusions
Currently no evidence is available to show the benefits or harms of stem cell‐based interventions for treatment or prevention of GM‐IVH in preterm infants.

Looking for Proof: Can Stem Cells Help Brain Bleeds in Premature Babies?

### **Rationale**
Babies who are born very early are called premature babies. Sometimes, these small babies can have bleeding inside their brain. This is a serious health problem that can cause lasting issues with how a child grows and learns.

Right now, doctors have very few ways to prevent or treat this brain bleeding. This means we need to find new treatments to help these babies.

One new idea is to use stem cells. Stem cells are special cells in our bodies. They can help the body heal and repair parts that are hurt. Researchers think that stem cell treatments might be able to help fix the brain damage from a bleed.

This project was a search for all the studies that have tested this idea. The goal was to find out if stem cell treatments are safe and if they really help babies with brain bleeds.

### **Trial Design**
This was not a study where researchers worked with patients. Instead, the researchers looked for all the studies that have already been done on this topic. This is called a review. It helps us see what all the research put together says about a treatment.

The researchers looked in many large databases of medical studies. They searched for studies that were finished by early 2019.

They were looking for a specific type of study. In these studies, patients are put into groups by chance. One group gets the new treatment, like stem cells. The other group gets a different treatment or a fake treatment. Comparing the groups is the best way to know if a new treatment works.

The researchers looked for studies that included:
*   Babies born very early (before 28 weeks) to see if stem cells could **prevent** a brain bleed.
*   Premature babies (born before 37 weeks) who already had a brain bleed, to see if stem cells could **treat** the damage.

### **Results**
The researchers looked through more than 700 study reports.

After their search, they did not find any finished studies that could answer their question. They found one study that is happening now, but it is not done yet, so there are no results from it.

This means that right now, we do not have proof that stem cell treatments help babies with brain bleeds. We also do not have proof about whether these treatments are safe or harmful for them.

The main conclusion from the researchers is that more studies are needed. Doctors and families need good research to know if stem cells are a good choice for treating or preventing brain bleeds in premature babies. Until that research is done, we do not have the evidence to use this treatment.","Stem cell‐based therapies for bleeding to the brain (germinal matrix‐intraventricular haemorrhage) in newborns born preterm 
Review question 
Do stem cell‐based therapies save the lives or improve the long‐term development of preterm newborns who have or may develop bleeding to the brain (""germinal matrix‐intraventricular haemorrhage"")? 
Background 
Newborns born too early (""preterm""), especially babies born before 28 weeks of pregnancy, sometimes develop bleeding to the brain. Babies with less severe bleeding may make a full recovery or may have only mild problems. For other babies with more serious bleeding, this may lead to death or to problems later in life.

The aim of this review was to assess whether stem cell‐based therapies could reduce death and improve the long‐term development of newborns born too early. During cell stem‐based therapy, stem cells are given to the baby, for instance, through injection. These stem cells may have come from humans or animals and may have been taken from cord blood, bone marrow, or other parts of the body. These cells then repair the brain cells that have been damaged by bleeding.

Are Stem Cells a Safe and Helpful Treatment for Brain Injury in Newborns? A Review of the Research

### **Rationale**

**What is the health problem?**

Sometimes, a baby’s brain does not get enough oxygen right before or during birth. This can cause a type of brain injury. Doctors call this injury hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, or HIE.

This brain injury is very serious. It is a main cause of death in newborn babies. Babies who survive can have long-term problems. These problems can affect how they move, learn, and grow throughout their lives. This can be very hard for the children and their families.

**Why did we do this study?**

Right now, the main treatment for this brain injury is to cool the baby’s body down. This is called cooling therapy. It can help some babies, but it does not work for everyone. Because of this, doctors and researchers are looking for new ways to help these babies.

One new idea is to use stem cells. Stem cells are special cells in our bodies. They have the power to grow into many different types of cells. Researchers think that stem cells might be able to help repair the brain after an injury. This could lead to better health for these babies.

This study looked for all the completed research on using stem cells to treat this brain injury in newborns. The main goal was to see if these treatments were safe and if they really helped.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a study that tested a treatment on new patients. Instead, it was a review of studies that have already been done. The researchers searched for a specific kind of study. These are called randomized controlled trials. These studies give the most reliable proof about a treatment.

In the studies the researchers looked for, newborn babies with the brain injury were split into groups by chance. One group would get the stem cell treatment. The other group would get a fake treatment, called a placebo, or no treatment at all. Putting babies into groups by chance is the best way to see if a treatment truly works.

The researchers planned to look at the results of these studies very carefully. They wanted to see if the stem cell treatment helped babies survive. They also wanted to know if it reduced major, long-term problems with the brain and a child’s development. These problems would be checked when the children were about two years old.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The researchers searched many medical databases to find completed studies. They found over 600 articles that might be about this topic. They looked at each one to see if it was the right type of study.

After checking all the articles, the researchers did not find any completed studies that they could include in their review. This means that, at the time of their search in 2020, there were no finished randomized controlled trials about using stem cells to treat this brain injury in babies.

**What do these results mean?**

Because no studies were found, we cannot say if stem cells are a good or bad treatment for this brain injury. We do not have proof to show if they help babies or cause any harm.

However, the researchers did find 15 studies that are happening right now but are not yet finished. This is good news. It shows that scientists are working hard to find answers for these babies and their families. When these studies are done, we will know much more.

The main conclusion from this review is that we need more research. Right now, there is no proof from the best type of studies to guide doctors on using stem cells for newborns with this brain injury. We must wait for the results of the studies that are now underway.","Stem cell‐based therapies following poor brain oxygenation at birth (hypoxic‐ischaemic encephalopathy) in newborns 
Review question 
Do stem cell‐based therapies save the lives, or improve the long‐term development, of newborns who have poor brain oxygenation at birth ('hypoxic‐ischaemic encephalopathy')? 
Background 
Lack of oxygen at birth may damage the brain of the newborn. Babies with less severe brain damage may make a full recovery or only have mild problems. For other babies with more serious damage, this may lead to death or to problems later in life. For instance, some of these babies develop cerebral palsy, intellectual disabilities, or other problems. We currently have  only cooling as an approach to treat this condition. The aim of this review was to assess if stem cell‐based therapies could reduce death and improve the long‐term development of newborns with poor brain oxygenation at birth. During stem cell‐based therapy, stem cells are given to the baby, for instance through injections.

10.1002-14651858.CD006237.pub4,"What are the best ways to help people with depression go back to work?
What is depression? 
Depression is a common mental health problem that can cause a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest in people, activities, and things that were once enjoyable. A person with depression may feel tearful, irritable, or tired most of the time, and may have problems with sleep, concentration, and memory. 
Depression may affect people's ability to work. People with depression may be absent from work (off sick), or feel less able to cope with working. 
Going back to work 
Reducing depressive symptoms may help people with depression to go back to work. Treatments include medications and psychological (talking) therapies, or a combination of both. Changes at the workplace could also help, such as: 
changing a person's tasks or working hours;
supporting them in a gradual return to work; or
helping them to cope better with certain work situations.
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
Work can improve a person's physical and mental well‑being; it helps build confidence and self‐esteem, allows people to socialise, and provides money. We wanted to find out if workplace changes and clinical programmes could help people with depression to return to work. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at whether workplace changes and clinical programmes affected the amount of sick leave taken by people with depression. Clinical programmes included: medicines (anti‐depressants); psychological therapies; improved healthcare by doctors; and other programmes such as exercise and diet.  
Search date: we included evidence published up to 4 April 2020. 
What we found 
We found 45 studies in 12,109 people with depression. The studies took place in Europe (34 studies), the USA (8), Australia (2) and Canada (1). 
The effects of 'care as usual' were compared with those of workplace changes and clinical programmes to find out: 
how many days people with depression were on sick leave
how many people with depression were off work;
people's symptoms of depression; and
how well people with depression could cope with their work.
What are the results of our review? 
Our main findings within the first year of follow‐up, for workplace changes or treatments compared with usual care, are listed below. 
Workplace changes combined with a clinical programme:
probably reduce the number of days on sick leave (on average, by 25 days for each person over one year; 9 studies; 1292 participants); 
do not reduce the number of people off work (2 studies; 1025 participants);
may reduce symptoms of depression (8 studies; 1091 participants); and
may improve ability to cope with work (5 studies; 926 participants).
Workplace changes alone:
may increase the number of days on sick leave (2 studies, 130 participants);
probably do not lead to more people off work (1 study; 226 participants);
probably do not affect symptoms of depression (4 studies; 390 participants); and
may not improve ability to cope with work (1 study; 48 participants).
Improved healthcare alone:
probably reduces the number of days on sick leave, by 20 days (in two, well‐conducted studies in 692 participants, although not in all 7 studies, in 1912 participants); 
probably reduces symptoms of depression (7 studies; 1808 participants); and
may reduce ability to cope with work (1 study; 604 participants).
Psychological therapies alone:
may reduce the number of days off work, by 15 days (9 studies; 1649 participants); and 
may reduce symptoms of depression (8 studies; 1255 participants).
We are uncertain if psychological therapies alone affect people's ability to cope with work (1 study; 58 participants). 
How reliable are these results? 
Our confidence in these results is mostly moderate to low. Some findings are based on small numbers of studies, in small numbers of participants. We also found limitations in the ways some studies were designed, conducted and reported. 
Key messages 
Combining workplace changes with a clinical programme probably helps people with depression to return to work more quickly and to take fewer days off sick. We need more evidence to assess which combination of workplace changes and clinical programmes works best. 
Improved healthcare probably also helps people with depression to take fewer days off sick.

What Helps People with Depression Return to Work?

**Rationale**
Depression is a common health problem. It can make a person feel very sad for a long time. They might lose interest in things they once enjoyed. A person with depression can feel tired, upset, or have trouble sleeping and focusing.

These feelings can make it very hard to work. A person might need to take time off from their job. Or they may find it hard to do their work well.

Work is an important part of life for many people. It provides money. It is a way to be around other people. It can also help people feel good about themselves. Researchers wanted to find the best ways to help people with depression get back to their jobs.

This study looked at different ways to help. The main idea was to see if special health care or changes at work could help people miss less work. This support could include things like medicine, talking with a therapist, or getting help from a boss.

**Trial Design**
This study was designed in a special way. The researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they carefully reviewed 45 studies that were already finished. By putting all the information together, they could find a stronger answer.

The 45 studies included more than 12,000 people who had depression. These people lived in different countries, mostly in Europe and the United States.

The researchers compared different types of support to the normal care a person usually gets. They looked at how these different types of support helped people over one year. The goal was to see which types of help led to fewer sick days.

**Results**
The researchers found that some types of help worked better than others. Here are the main results.

**1. Help at work and health care together**
This type of support seemed to work the best. People who got help at their job and also received health care took fewer sick days. On average, they took about 25 fewer sick days in a year. This approach also might help lower the feelings of depression. It might also help people feel more able to handle their work.

**2. Help at work by itself**
Making changes at the workplace, without also providing health care, did not seem to help. This approach did not help people take fewer sick days. It also did not seem to lower feelings of depression.

**3. Better health care by itself**
Getting improved health care from a doctor also helped. This probably helped people take fewer sick days. People who got this help took about 20 fewer sick days in a year. This type of care also probably helped lower their feelings of depression.

**4. Talking therapy by itself**
Talking with a professional therapist might help people take fewer sick days. This help led to about 15 fewer sick days in a year. Talking therapy might also help lower a person's feelings of depression.

**What do these results mean?**
The researchers are fairly sure about these results. But they said we should be careful, because some of the studies they looked at were small.

The most important message is that combining two types of help works best. Giving a person support at work *and* providing them with health care is probably the best way to help them miss less work. Improved health care on its own also seems to help. More studies are needed to be sure about the very best way to support people with depression at work.","What are the best ways to help people with depression go back to work?

10.1002-14651858.CD011364.pub2,"Ultrasound use for insertion of arterial catheters in children
Background 
An arterial catheter is a thin tube or line that can be inserted into an artery. Arterial catheters are used to monitor blood pressure during complex surgeries and during stays in intensive care. Ultrasound imaging (an image created with sound waves of soft tissue) allows anaesthesiologists and intensivists to see surrounding structures. Ultrasound can help medical practitioners accurately locate the artery and insert the catheter, and, particularly when surgeries involve children, ultrasound can prevent the need for multiple needle sticks. This reduces the occurrence of haematoma (a localized collection of blood outside the blood vessels) or damage to the artery, compared with other techniques such as palpation of the artery (feeling through the skin for the pulse) or Doppler auditory assistance (listening for a change to a higher pitch at the exact location of the artery). Our aim was to find out whether ultrasound offers any advantages over palpation of the artery or Doppler auditory assistance. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to January 2016. We found five eligible studies ‐ four comparing ultrasound with palpation and one comparing ultrasound with Doppler auditory assistance. 
Key results 
We included in the review children aged one month to 18 years. We found that ultrasound increased the rate of successful cannulation at the first attempt and reduced the formation of haematomas. Ultrasound also increased the success rate within two attempts. It is likely that ultrasound is more useful for infants and small children than for older children. It is also likely that ultrasound is more useful if the practitioner is experienced in its use. 
Quality of the evidence 
We noted variation in the risk of bias of included studies. We rated the quality of evidence as moderate mainly because the number of studies was limited. For the same reason, we could not confirm the effect of age and expertise in ultrasound usage. 
Conclusions 
Our evidence suggests that ultrasound is superior to other techniques for arterial catheter insertion, particularly in babies and young children.

Is Using Sound Waves a Better Way to Place a Thin Tube in a Child’s Artery?

**Rationale**

Your body has tubes that carry blood from your heart to the rest of your body. These tubes are called arteries. Sometimes, when a child is very sick or having a big surgery, doctors need to watch their health very closely. One way they do this is by checking the child's blood pressure all the time. Blood pressure shows how well the heart is pumping blood.

To check blood pressure constantly, doctors place a very thin, soft plastic tube into one of the child’s arteries. This thin tube is called an arterial catheter. It stays in place so doctors can get information quickly without using a needle each time. Putting this tube in can be hard, especially in babies and young children. This is because their arteries are very small and can be difficult to find.

For many years, doctors found the artery by feeling for a pulse with their fingers. Another way was to use a special device to listen for the sound of the blood flow. Sometimes, these ways could take a few tries. Each try means another poke with a needle. This can be stressful for the child and can sometimes cause a bad bruise. A bruise happens when a little blood leaks out under the skin.

This study was done to see if a different method was better. This method uses a tool called an ultrasound machine. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the inside of the body, like a video of the artery. The doctors can see the artery on a screen. This study looked at whether using ultrasound helps doctors place the thin tube more easily and safely in children.

**Trial Design**

This was not a new medical study with patients. Instead, the researchers looked at studies that were already finished. This is called a review. A review helps us understand what all the past research on a topic says when we put it all together.

The researchers searched for all studies on this topic up to January 2016. They found five studies that fit their goal. The children in these studies were between one month and 18 years old.

The five studies all compared using ultrasound to one of the older methods. Four of the studies compared ultrasound to the method of feeling for a pulse. The fifth study compared ultrasound to the method of listening for the blood flow sound. The researchers looked at the results from all these studies to see which method worked best.

**Results**

The researchers found that using ultrasound to guide the needle was better than the other methods.

One of the main benefits was success on the first try. When doctors used ultrasound, they were able to get the thin tube into the artery on the first try more often. This means fewer pokes for the child. The overall success rate within two tries was also higher with ultrasound.

Another important benefit was safety. Children had fewer bad bruises when doctors used ultrasound. Because the doctors could see the artery on the screen, they were less likely to damage it or the area around it. This makes the process safer and more comfortable for the child.

The study also suggested that ultrasound is most helpful for babies and small children. Their arteries are the smallest, so being able to see them on a screen is a big help. The results also showed that doctors who have more experience using ultrasound machines have more success.

The researchers said the proof from this review is good, but not perfect. They called the quality of the evidence ""moderate."" This was because they could only find five studies to review. With more studies in the future, our understanding will get even stronger.

Based on the information they found, the researchers concluded that using ultrasound is the best method for placing a thin tube in a child's artery. It works better and is safer, especially for the youngest patients.","Ultrasound use for insertion of arterial catheters in children

We included in the review children aged one month to 18 years. We found that ultrasound increased the rate of successful cannulation at the first attempt and reduced the formation of haematomas. Ultrasound also increased the success rate within two attempts. It is likely that ultrasound is more useful for infants and small children than for older children. It is also likely that ultrasound is more useful if the practitioner is experienced in its use. 
Quality of the evidence 
We noted variation in the risk of bias of included studies. We rated the quality of evidence as moderate mainly because the number of studies was limited. For the same reason, we could not confirm the effect of age and expertise in ultrasound usage. 
Conclusions 
Our evidence suggests that ultrasound is superior to other techniques for arterial catheter insertion, particularly in babies and young children.

Do Ayurvedic Treatments Help People with Diabetes?

**Rationale**

Diabetes is a long-term health problem. It means your body has too much sugar in its blood. This can lead to serious health issues over time.

Many people with diabetes look for other ways to manage their health. They sometimes use treatments called complementary or alternative medicines. Ayurveda is one of these. It is a traditional type of medicine from India.

We wanted to know if Ayurvedic treatments for diabetes are safe and if they work. This is important so that patients and doctors can make good choices about their care. We looked at past studies to see what they found.

**Trial Design**

This was not a new study with our own patients. Instead, we did a review. A review means we looked at studies that other people already finished.

We found seven studies to look at. These studies included a total of 354 adults. All of these people had type 2 diabetes, which is the most common kind.

In these studies, some people got an Ayurvedic treatment. Other people got a fake treatment called a placebo, or no treatment at all. This helped researchers compare the results. The treatments in the studies were mostly special pills made from a mix of herbs. The studies lasted for three to six months.

**Results**

The main question was: did the treatments lower blood sugar? Some studies showed good results. Three of the studies found that certain herbal pills lowered blood sugar levels over time. This was measured by a blood test called HbA1c. This test shows your average blood sugar over a few months.

Two other studies found that the herbal pills lowered blood sugar in the morning, before people had anything to eat. The treatments also seemed safe. No serious side effects were reported in the studies. The people taking the herbal pills did not have more side effects than the people who did not take them.

However, we cannot say for sure that these treatments work for diabetes. The studies we looked at were very small. The way the studies were done was also not very strong. The studies also did not look at whether the treatments help with serious problems caused by diabetes, like heart or kidney disease.

Our main conclusion is that we need more and better research. We need bigger studies to learn if these treatments can really help people with diabetes. These new studies should also test Ayurveda the way it is often used. This includes herbal medicine plus changes in diet, exercise, and lifestyle.","Ayurvedic treatments for diabetes mellitus:

10.1002-14651858.CD004314.pub3,"A comparison of botulinum toxin type A versus botulinum toxin type B for involuntary positioning of the head, or cervical dystonia 
The review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of botulinum toxin type A (BtA) compared to botulinum toxin type B (BtB) in people with involuntary positioning of the head, or cervical dystonia. This is an update of a previous Cochrane Review and we assessed the effectiveness (reduction in severity, disability and pain) and safety of BtA versus BtB in cervical dystonia. 
Background 
Cervical dystonia, also called spasmodic torticollis, is a disease that causes undesired, uncontrollable, often painful, abnormal placement of the head. It is a relatively uncommon condition (affecting 57 to 280 people per million) that can be very disabling and can affect a person's quality of life negatively. In most cases the cause is unknown and no cure exists. Since cervical dystonia is normally a long‐term disease it requires long‐term treatment. 
Botulinum toxin (Bt) is a powerful, natural chemical that can cause severe paralysis (an inability to move in the part of the body where it is applied) in animals and humans. It can also be used to treat many conditions, in particular those with involuntary muscle contractions, such as cervical dystonia. Bt is delivered by injections into the muscles that contract to produce the disease. There are different types of Bt, not all are available for treating health conditions. BtA is typically the first‐used treatment in cervical dystonia, but botulinum toxin type B (BtB) is an alternative option. The relative strength of each Bt formulation is variable, and the cost for 200 units varies from GBP 198 to GBP 308. 
Study characteristics 
We performed a rigorous search of the medical literature in October 2016 and found three studies that compared a single treatment session of BtA with BtB. These studies included a total of 270 participants, with on average a moderate disease impairment. The participants remained in the studies for a short period of time ‐ between 16 and 20 weeks after the treatment. The average age of people in the studies was 53.3 years, and they had had cervical dystonia for an average of 6.6 to 7.9 years before taking part in the trials. Most, 63.3%, of the people in the studies were women. All three of the studies were funded by drug manufacturers with possible interests in the results of the studies. 
Key results 
The results show little or no difference between BtA and BtB in the main measures of overall improvement and safety, including the total number of adverse (unwanted or harmful) events. There was also little or no difference between BtA and BtB in the self‐evaluations reported by the study participants. Based on the results we would expect that, out of 1000 people with cervical dystonia treated with BtB, there would be 362 more people who experience dry mouth/sore throat compared to 1000 people treated with BtA. The studies which looked at the duration of effect showed little or no difference between BtA and BtB. None of the studies examined the impact of either Bt on quality of life. 
Quality of the evidence 
All of the studies included participants that were different to the average person who suffers from cervical dystonia. To be included participants had to have a history of successful treatment with Bt. People with certain types of cervical dystonia, in particular the forms that make the head turn backward or forward, were not allowed to participate in the studies. 
Not enough participants were included across the studies for us to be completely confident in the results for the total number of adverse events, the self‐reported evaluations by participants or the pain assessment. 
The quality of the evidence for overall improvement and total number of adverse events was low. The quality of the evidence for more sore throat/dry mouth in people receiving BtB is moderate. The quality of the evidence where participants gave their self‐assessments is low. 
No definite conclusions can be drawn regarding overall safety and long‐term utility of BtA compared to BtB in cervical dystonia.

Comparing Two Medicines for Uncontrolled Head and Neck Movements

**Rationale**
Some people have a health problem called cervical dystonia. This condition causes the muscles in the neck to tighten up without their control. This makes the head turn or move into an odd and often painful position. This can make daily life very hard.

There is no cure for this health problem. But a medicine called botulinum toxin can help people. This medicine is given as a shot into the tight neck muscles. It helps the muscles relax. This can reduce pain and help control the head's movement.

There are two main types of this medicine. One is called botulinum toxin type A. The other is called botulinum toxin type B. Doctors wanted to know if one type works better or is safer than the other. This study looked at the evidence to compare the two medicines.

**Trial Design**
This report did not do a new study. Instead, researchers looked at the results from three past studies. These studies had already compared the two medicines.

A total of 270 people took part in these three studies. The average age of the people was 53 years. They had lived with cervical dystonia for about 7 or 8 years. About 6 out of every 10 people in the studies were women.

In the studies, each person got one shot of either medicine type A or medicine type B. The researchers then watched them for about 4 to 5 months. It is important to know that the people in these studies had all used this kind of medicine before and it had worked for them.

**Results**
The results showed that both medicines worked about the same. They both helped to reduce the neck problems. The good effects from both medicines also seemed to last for a similar amount of time. People who took the medicines also reported feeling better in similar ways, no matter which type they got.

When looking at safety, the two medicines were also very similar. But there was one key difference. People who got medicine type B were more likely to have a dry mouth or a sore throat. For every 1000 people who got medicine B, about 362 more had this side effect than those who got medicine A.

The researchers said that we need to be careful with these results. The studies were small. Also, the people in the studies may not be like most people who have this health problem. The companies that make these medicines also paid for the studies. Because of this, we cannot be sure which medicine is better or safer in the long term. More research is needed to find a clear answer.","A comparison of botulinum toxin type A versus botulinum toxin type B for involuntary positioning of the head, or cervical dystonia

10.1002-14651858.CD013163.pub2,"Background
Conventionally used soybean oil‐based lipid emulsion (S‐LE) have high polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content and phytosterols that may contribute to adverse effects in preterm infants. The newer lipid emulsions (LE) from different lipid sources are currently available for use in preterm infants. 
Objectives
To compare the safety and efficacy of all LE for parenteral nutrition (PN) in preterm infants (less than 37 weeks' gestation) including preterm infants with surgical conditions or parenteral nutrition‐associated liver disease (PNALD)/cholestasis using direct comparisons and pair‐wise meta‐analyses. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1946 to 18 June 2018), Embase (1974 to 18 July 2018), CINAHL (1982 to 18 June 2018), MIDRIS (1971 to 31 May 2018), conference proceedings, trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO's Trials Registry and Platform), and reference lists of retrieved articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled studies in preterm infants with or without surgical conditions or PNALD within the first six months of life. 
Data collection and analysis
Data collection and analysis conformed to the methods of Cochrane Neonatal. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence for important outcomes in addition to reporting statistical significance of results. 
Main results
We included 29 studies (n = 2037) in this review. LE were classified in three broad groups: 1. all fish oil‐containing LE including pure fish oil‐LE (F‐LE) and multisource LE (e.g. medium‐chain triglycerides (MCT)‐olive‐fish‐soybean oil‐LE (MOFS‐LE), MCT‐fish‐soybean oil‐LE (MFS‐LE) and olive‐fish‐soybean oil‐LE (OFS‐LE); 2. conventional S‐LE; 3. alternative‐LE (e.g. MCT‐soybean oil‐LE (MS‐LE), olive‐soybean oil‐LE and borage oil‐based LE). 
We considered the following broad comparisons: fish oil LE versus non‐fish oil LE; fish oil LE versus another fish oil LE; alternative‐LE versus S‐LE; alternative‐LE versus another alternative‐LE in preterm infants less than 37 weeks' gestation, preterm infants with surgical conditions and preterm infants with PNALD/cholestasis. Separate subgroup comparisons of each LE preparation were included within these broader groups. 
Most studies in preterm infants used PN for mean duration of four weeks or less and for longer duration in infants with cholestasis or surgical conditions. 
We defined the primary outcome of PNALD/cholestasis as conjugated bilirubin (Cbil) 2 mg/dL or greater and resolution of PNALD/cholestasis as Cbil less than 2 mg/dL. There was heterogeneity in definitions used by the included studies with Cbil cut‐offs ranging from 17.1 μmol/L (1 mg/dL) up to 50 μmol/L (about 3 mg/dL). 
In preterm infants, meta‐analysis found no evidence of a difference in the incidence of PNALD/cholestasis (Cbil cut‐off: 2 mg/dl) between fish oil‐LEs and all non‐fish oil LEs (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 1.56; typical risk difference (RD) –0.03, 95% CI –0.08 to 0.02; 4 studies; n = 328; low‐quality evidence). 
We also considered an outcome allowing for any definition of PNALD (different Cbil cutoffs). In the meta‐analysis for PNALD/cholestasis, using any definition and restricted to low or unclear risk of bias studies, there was no evidence of a difference between fish oil LE and all non‐fish oil LE for incidence of cholestasis (typical RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.21; typical RD –0.02, 95% CI –0.05 to 0.02; 10 studies; n = 1024; low‐quality evidence). There was no evidence of difference in subgroup meta‐analyses of individual LE types in any comparison. 
In preterm infants with surgical conditions or cholestasis, there was only one small study each reporting no evidence of a difference in incidence or resolution of cholestasis respectively with use of a pure F‐LE versus S‐LE (using a Cbil cut‐off of 2 mg/dL). 
In preterm infants with PNALD/cholestasis (using any definition), the meta‐analysis showed significantly less cholestasis with the use of fish oil‐LE compared to S‐LE (typical RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.91; typical RD –0.39, 95% CI –0.65 to –0.12; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 3, 95% CI 2 to 9; 2 studies; n = 40; very low‐quality evidence). However, this outcome had a very low number of participants from two small studies with methodological differences, one of which was terminated early, increasing the uncertainty about effect estimates. 
There were no differences between LE types in pair‐wise meta‐analyses for growth in preterm infants. There was paucity of studies in preterm infants with surgical conditions or cholestasis to perform meta‐analyses for growth and most other outcomes. 
In the secondary outcomes for preterm infants, there was no difference between fish‐oil LE and non‐fish oil LE in meta‐analysis for severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (stage 3 or greater, or requiring surgery: typical RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.16; typical RD –0.03, 95% CI –0.07 to 0.02; 7 studies; n = 731; very low‐quality evidence). There were no differences in the LE types in pair‐wise meta‐analyses for death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), ventilation duration, patent ductus arteriosus, sepsis, necrotising enterocolitis, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, jaundice, hyperglycaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, intrahepatocellular lipid content and conjugated bilirubin levels in any comparison. 
In surgical infants, one study (n = 19) reported no differences in death, sepsis rates, Cbil and neurodevelopmental outcomes with pure F‐LE versus S‐LE. 
In infants with cholestasis, there were no evidence of differences in death or sepsis in meta‐analyses between fish oil‐LE and S‐LE; (2 studies; n = 40; very low‐quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
In the current review, we did not find any particular LE with or without fish oil to be better than another LE in preterm infants for prevention of PNALD/cholestasis, growth, mortality, ROP, BPD and other neonatal outcomes. 
In preterm infants with surgical conditions or cholestasis, there is currently insufficient evidence from randomised studies to determine with any certainty if fish oil LEs offer advantage in prevention or resolution of cholestasis or in any other clinical outcome. 
Further research, with larger well‐designed trials, is warranted to evaluate the ideal composition of LE in preterm infants and the role of fish oil‐containing and other LEs in the prevention and resolution of PNALD, ROP and other clinical outcomes.

Comparing IV Fats for Babies Born Too Early

### **Rationale**
Babies who are born very early are called premature babies. Sometimes, they are too small or sick to eat on their own. When this happens, they get liquid food through a small tube in a vein. This is a special way to feed them and help them grow.

This liquid food contains fats. For many years, the main type of fat used was made from soybean oil. Some doctors worried that this soybean oil fat could cause problems for a premature baby’s liver.

Now, there are newer types of fats available. Some of these are made with different oils, like fish oil or olive oil. Researchers wanted to know if these newer fats are safer or work better for premature babies. This study was done to compare all the different types of fats to find out which one is best.

### **Trial Design**
This was not a new medical study with new babies. Instead, the researchers gathered the results from many past studies. They found 29 studies that had already been completed. In total, these studies included over 2,000 premature babies.

The researchers carefully looked at the results of all 29 studies together. This helps to get a stronger and more reliable answer.

The babies in these studies were all born before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Some of the babies had other health issues. For example, some needed surgery, and others already had liver problems. The studies compared different types of fats. The researchers put the fats into groups, such as fats with fish oil, the common soybean oil fat, and other newer fats.

Most babies in the studies received the liquid food for about four weeks or less. Babies who had surgery or liver problems often received it for a longer time.

### **Results**
The main question was whether any type of fat was better at preventing liver problems. After looking at all the studies, the researchers did not find a clear winner. The fats that contained fish oil did not seem to be better at preventing liver problems than the other types of fats. The proof from these studies was not very strong.

The researchers also looked at other important health issues for premature babies. They checked to see if one type of fat was better for helping babies grow. They found that all the fats worked about the same for growth.

They also looked at other health problems that can affect premature babies, such as:
*   Serious eye problems
*   Lung problems
*   Death
*   Infections

For all these issues, the researchers found no real difference between the types of fats. No single type of fat, including those with fish oil, was clearly better at preventing these problems.

Based on all the information they reviewed, the researchers concluded that we still do not know which type of fat is best for premature babies. The current evidence does not show that one type is safer or works better than another. They believe that we need new, larger, and better-designed studies to find the right answer. This future research will help doctors give the best possible care to these tiny babies.","Systematic review of lipid emulsions for intravenous nutrition in preterm infants.
Review question: which lipid (fat) emulsions (LE) have the best outcomes in preterm infants with and without liver disease and surgical conditions? 
Background: preterm infants who need nutrition (feeding) through intravenous (into a vein; called parenteral nutrition) lines have been conventionally given pure soybean oil‐based fat emulsions. However, high polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content and phytosterols in pure soybean oil‐based emulsions may be harmful and contribute to parenteral nutrition‐associated liver disease (PNALD). The newer lipid emulsions (LE) from alternative lipid sources, including fish oil, may potentially improve clinical outcomes in preterm infants by decreasing PUFA content and providing lipid source‐specific benefits. 
Study characteristics: we searched the medical literature and identified 29 studies (including 2037 preterm infants). The evidence is up to date as of 18 June 2018. 
Key findings: in the population of preterm infants, without liver disease or surgical conditions, no particular LE was better than another for growth, liver disease, death, retinopathy (eye disease), infection and chronic lung disease. 
While there was very low quality and limited evidence to suggest that fish oil‐based LE may improve liver disease‐related outcomes in infants with pre‐existing liver disease, this evidence was based on a limited number of infants from two small studies, one of which was terminated early, and no certain conclusions can be drawn. 
Conclusions: based on this review, no particular LE is better than another for intravenous nutrition in preterm infants. There currently exists insufficient evidence from well‐designed studies about the benefit of fish oil‐LE for improving liver disease‐related outcomes in infants with pre‐existing liver disease or surgical conditions. Further research is required to establish the role of fish oil‐LE for liver disease outcomes in preterm infants and the ideal composition of LE for preterm infants.

10.1002-14651858.CD012019,"Urinary biomarkers for the non‐invasive diagnosis of endometriosis
Review Question 
How accurate are urine test in detecting endometriosis? Can any urine test be accurate enough to replace or reduce the need for surgery in the diagnosis of endometriosis? 
Background 
Women with endometriosis have endometrial tissue (the tissue that lines the womb and is shed during menstruation) growing outside the womb within the pelvic cavity. This tissue responds to reproductive hormones causing painful periods, chronic lower abdominal pain and difficulty conceiving. Currently, the only reliable way of diagnosing endometriosis is to perform laparoscopic surgery and visualise the endometrial deposits inside the abdomen. Because surgery is risky and expensive, urine tests have been evaluated for their ability to detect endometriosis non‐invasively. An accurate urine test could lead to the diagnosis of endometriosis without the need for surgery; or it could reduce the need for diagnostic surgery, so only women who were most likely to have endometriosis would require it. Other non‐invasive ways of diagnosing endometriosis using blood, imaging, endometrial and combination tests are evaluated in separate Cochrane reviews from this series. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence included in this review is current to July 2015. We included eight studies involving 646 participants. All studies evaluated reproductive‐aged women who were undertaking diagnostic surgery to investigate symptoms of endometriosis or for other indications. Five studies evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of four urinary biomarkers, including four biomarkers that were expressed differently in women with and without endometriosis and one showing no difference between the two groups. Three other studies just identified three biomarkers that did not distinguish the two groups. 
Key results 
None of the assessed biomarkers, including cytokeratin 19 (CK 19), enolase 1 (NNE), vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) and urinary peptide profiling have been evaluated by enough studies to provide a meaningful assessment of test accuracy. None of the tests were accurate enough to replace diagnostic surgery. Several studies identified biomarkers that might be of value in diagnosing endometriosis, but there are too few reports to be sure of their diagnostic benefit. There is not enough evidence to recommend any urinary biomarker for use in clinical practice for the diagnosis of endometriosis. 
Quality of the evidence 
Generally, the reports were of low methodological quality and urine tests were only assessed in small individual studies. 
Future research 
More high quality research trials are needed to accurately assess the diagnostic potential of urinary biomarkers identified in small numbers of studies as having value in detecting endometriosis.

Can a Urine Test Be Used to Find Endometriosis? A Review of Past Studies

### **Rationale**

**What is endometriosis and why is it a problem?**

Endometriosis is a health condition that affects many women. Inside a woman’s womb, there is a lining of tissue. Each month, this lining builds up and is then shed during a woman's period. In endometriosis, tissue that is like this lining grows in the wrong places, outside of the womb. It often grows in the lower belly area.

This misplaced tissue can cause serious problems. It can lead to very painful periods. Some women have constant pain in their lower belly that does not go away. Endometriosis can also make it difficult for a woman to become pregnant. This pain and the trouble with getting pregnant can be a heavy burden for women.

**How do doctors find endometriosis now?**

Today, there is only one sure way for doctors to know if a woman has endometriosis. This is done with a type of surgery called a laparoscopy. During this surgery, a doctor makes a very small cut in the belly. They then use a tiny camera to look inside the body for the misplaced tissue.

**Why is a new test needed?**

Surgery is not a simple or easy step. All surgery has risks, like infections or other problems. Surgery can also cost a lot of money. Because of these issues, researchers want to find a new way to test for endometriosis. They are looking for a test that is safe, simple, and does not involve cutting the skin.

This study looked at whether a simple urine test could be used. A urine test is easy for patients and has no risks. A good urine test could help find endometriosis much earlier and more easily. It might mean that many women would not need to have surgery just to get a diagnosis.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This work was a review of studies that were already completed. The researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they gathered all the past research they could find on using urine tests to find endometriosis. They looked for studies that were published up to July 2015.

The researchers found eight studies that met their goals. These eight studies included a total of 646 women. All the women in these studies were of an age where they could have children. They were all going to have surgery to check for symptoms that might be from endometriosis.

The studies all looked for things called “biomarkers” in the women’s urine. Biomarkers are like clues or signs in the body that can point to a certain disease. The goal was to see if the urine from women with endometriosis had different clues than the urine from women without endometriosis.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The review found that there is not enough evidence to support using any urine test to find endometriosis. None of the clues, or biomarkers, that were studied were accurate enough to be used in a clinic. A urine test cannot replace surgery for diagnosing endometriosis at this time.

**Why were the tests not accurate enough?**

There were two main problems with the studies that were reviewed. First, the studies were very small. They did not include enough women to give a clear and certain answer. When studies are too small, their results may not be reliable.

Second, the quality of the studies was generally low. This means that the way the studies were designed and run had weaknesses. These weaknesses make it hard to be sure about the results. For these reasons, the evidence is not strong enough to make any changes in how doctors find endometriosis.

**What is the final conclusion?**

The researchers concluded that no urine test can be recommended for diagnosing endometriosis right now. While some studies found clues that might be useful one day, much more research is needed.

Future studies need to be much larger and must be designed in a better way. This high-quality research is the only way to know for sure if a simple urine test could one day help women get an earlier and easier diagnosis for endometriosis.","Urinary biomarkers for the non‐invasive diagnosis of endometriosis
Review Question 
How accurate are urine test in detecting endometriosis? Can any urine test be accurate enough to replace or reduce the need for surgery in the diagnosis of endometriosis? 
Background 
Women with endometriosis have endometrial tissue (the tissue that lines the womb and is shed during menstruation) growing outside the womb within the pelvic cavity. This tissue responds to reproductive hormones causing painful periods, chronic lower abdominal pain and difficulty conceiving. Currently, the only reliable way of diagnosing endometriosis is to perform laparoscopic surgery and visualise the endometrial deposits inside the abdomen. Because surgery is risky and expensive, urine tests have been evaluated for their ability to detect endometriosis non‐invasively. An accurate urine test could lead to the diagnosis of endometriosis without the need for surgery; or it could reduce the need for diagnostic surgery, so only women who were most likely to have endometriosis would require it. Other non‐invasive ways of diagnosing endometriosis using blood, imaging, endometrial and combination tests are evaluated in separate Cochrane reviews from this series. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence included in this review is current to July 2015. We included eight studies involving 646 participants. All studies evaluated reproductive‐aged women who were undertaking diagnostic surgery to investigate symptoms of endometriosis or for other indications. Five studies evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of four urinary biomarkers, including four biomarkers that were expressed differently in women with and without endometriosis and one showing no difference between the two groups. Three other studies just identified three biomarkers that did not distinguish the two groups. 
Key results 
None of the assessed biomarkers, including cytokeratin 19 (CK 19), enolase 1 (NNE), vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) and urinary peptide profiling have been evaluated by enough studies to provide a meaningful assessment of test accuracy. None of the tests were accurate enough to replace diagnostic surgery. Several studies identified biomarkers that might be of value in diagnosing endometriosis, but there are too few reports to be sure of their diagnostic benefit. There is not enough evidence to recommend any urinary biomarker for use in clinical practice for the diagnosis of endometriosis. 
Quality of the evidence 
Generally, the reports were of low methodological quality and urine tests were only assessed in small individual studies. 
Future research 
More high quality research trials are needed to accurately assess the diagnostic potential of urinary biomarkers identified in small numbers of studies as having value in detecting endometriosis.

Breast cancer will affect one in eight women during their lifetime. The opportunity to restore the removed tissue and cosmetic appearance is provided by reconstructive breast surgery following skin‐sparing mastectomy (SSM). Mastectomy skin flap necrosis (MSFN) is a common complication following SSM breast reconstruction. This postoperative complication can be prevented by intraoperative assessment of mastectomy skin flap viability and intervention when tissue perfusion is compromised. Indocyanine green fluorescence angiography is presumed to be a better predictor of MSFN compared to clinical evaluation alone. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of indocyanine green fluorescence angiography (ICGA) for preventing mastectomy skin flap necrosis in women undergoing immediate breast reconstruction following skin‐sparing mastectomy. 
To summarise the different ICGA protocols available for assessment of mastectomy skin flap perfusion in women undergoing immediate breast reconstructions following skin‐sparing mastectomy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Issue 3, 2019), MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and Clinicaltrials.gov in April 2019. In addition, we searched reference lists of published studies. 
Selection criteria
We included studies that compared the use of ICGA to clinical evaluation to assess mastectomy skin vascularisation and recruited women undergoing immediate autologous or prosthetic reconstructive surgery following SSM for confirmed breast malignancy or high risk of developing breast cancer. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the included nonrandomised studies and extracted data on postoperative outcomes, including postoperative MSFN, reoperation, autologous flap necrosis, dehiscence, infection, haematoma and seroma, and patient‐related outcomes. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach and we constructed two 'Summary of finding's tables: one for the comparison of ICGA to clinical evaluation on a per patient basis and one on a per breast basis. 
Main results
Nine nonrandomised cohort studies met the inclusion criteria and involved a total of 1589 women with 2199 breast reconstructions. We included seven retrospective and two prospective cohort studies. Six studies reported the number of MSFN on a per breast basis for a total of 1435 breasts and three studies reported the number of MSFN on a per patient basis for a total of 573 women. Five studies reported the number of other complications on a per breast basis for a total of 1370 breasts and four studies reported the number on a per patient basis for a total of 613 patients. Therefore, we decided to pool data separately. 
Risk of bias for each included nonrandomised study was assessed using the Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale for cohort studies. There was serious concern with risk of bias due to the nonrandomised study design of all included studies and the low comparability of cohorts in most studies. The quality of the evidence was found to be very low, after downgrading the quality of evidence twice for imprecision based on the small sample sizes and low number of events in the included studies. 
Postoperative complications on a per patient basis 
We are uncertain about the effect of ICGA on MSFN (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.56; three studies, 573 participants: very low quality of evidence), infection rates (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.40; four studies, 613 participants: very low quality of evidence), haematoma rates (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.53; two studies, 459 participants: very low quality of evidence) and seroma rates (RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.41 to 6.80; two studies, 408 participants: very low quality of evidence) compared to the clinical group. We found evidence that ICGA may reduce reoperation rates (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.72; four studies, 613 participants: very low quality of evidence). One study considered dehiscence as an outcome. In this single study, dehiscence was observed in 2.2% of participants (4/184) in the ICGA group compared to 0.5% of participants (1/184) in the clinical group (P = 0.372). The RR was 4.00 (95% CI 0.45 to 35.45; one study; 368 participants; very low quality of evidence). 
Postoperative complications on a per breast basis 
We found evidence that ICGA may reduce MSFN (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.82; six studies, 1435 breasts: very low quality of evidence), may reduce reoperation rates (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.92; five studies, 1370 breasts: very low quality of evidence) and may reduce infection rates (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.97; five studies, 1370 breasts: very low quality of evidence) compared to the clinical group. We are uncertain about the effect of ICGA on haematoma rates (RR 1.53, CI 95% 0.47 to 4.95; four studies, 1042 breasts: very low quality of evidence) and seroma rates (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.35; two studies, 528 breasts: very low quality of evidence). 
None of the studies reported patient‐related outcomes.
ICGA protocols: eight studies used the SPY System and one study used the Photodynamic Eye imaging system (PDE) to assess MSFN. ICGA protocols in the included studies were not extensively described in most studies. 
Authors' conclusions
Although mastectomy skin flap perfusion is performed more frequently using ICGA as a helpful tool, there is a lack of high‐quality evidence in the context of randomised controlled trials. The quality of evidence in this review is very low, since only nonrandomised cohort studies have been included. With the results from this review, no conclusions can be drawn about what method of assessment is best to use during breast reconstructive surgery. High‐quality randomised controlled studies that compare the use of ICGA to assess MSFN compared to clinical evaluation are needed.

Using a Special Dye to Check Skin Health After Breast Reconstruction Surgery

**Rationale**

About 1 in 8 women will have breast cancer in their life. Many women have surgery to remove the breast. This surgery is called a mastectomy. After a mastectomy, some women choose to have a new breast mound built. This is called breast reconstruction surgery.

One type of mastectomy is called a ""skin-sparing"" mastectomy. In this surgery, the doctor removes the breast tissue but saves most of the skin. This skin is called a skin flap. It is used to help build the new breast.

A common problem after this surgery is that the skin flap does not get enough blood. If the skin does not get enough blood, the skin tissue can die. Doctors need a good way to check the blood flow to the skin during surgery to prevent this.

Right now, doctors often just look at the skin to check its color and warmth. This study looked at another method. This method uses a special green dye and a camera to see the blood flow inside the skin. Researchers wanted to know if using this special dye was better at preventing skin problems than just looking at the skin.

**Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, the researchers looked for all the studies that had already been done on this topic. This is called a review.

The researchers found 9 studies to include in their review. In total, these studies included about 1600 women. All the women in the studies had a skin-sparing mastectomy and had a new breast built right away. The women had this surgery because they had breast cancer or were at very high risk for it.

The studies compared two groups of women.
*   In one group, doctors used the special green dye and camera to check blood flow in the skin flap.
*   In the other group, doctors used the usual method of just looking at the skin to check its health.

The researchers then compared the results from both groups to see which method worked better.

**Results**

The researchers found that the 9 studies they reviewed were not of the best quality. This means we cannot be fully sure about the results. The proof from these studies is considered ""very low"" quality.

When the researchers looked at the results for each new breast that was built, they found that the special dye may have helped.
*   Using the dye may have lowered the chance of the skin tissue dying.
*   It may have lowered the number of women who needed another surgery to fix problems.
*   It may have also lowered the risk of getting an infection.

When the researchers looked at the results for each person, the results were less clear. Using the dye may have lowered the need for more surgery. But it was not clear if it helped prevent skin tissue death or infections for the person as a whole. The researchers also could not tell if the dye helped prevent other problems, like a build-up of blood or fluid under the skin.

Based on this review, the authors concluded that we still do not have enough good proof. We cannot say for sure that using the special dye is better than the usual method. They believe that better studies are needed to find the best way to check skin health during breast reconstruction surgery.","Indocyanine green angiography versus clinical evaluation in preventing postoperative complications following breast reconstruction after mastectomy 
What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane review was to find out whether the use of a new imaging technique, called indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), during reconstructive breast surgery can reduce necrosis (cell death) of the overlying breast skin and other complications such as infections, following reconstructive breast surgery after mastectomy.  We included women who had undergone skin‐sparing mastectomy (that is, where the whole breast including nipple is removed, sparing the overlying breast skin) for breast cancer or women who were at high risk of developing breast cancer (because of faulty genes). We collected and analysed all relevant studies to provide a review that will inform doctors and patients on ICGA use in reconstructive breast surgery.  Key messages The use of ICGA during reconstructive breast surgery seems to reduce the chance of reoperations when compared to clinical evaluation only. We are uncertain about the effect of ICGA on reducing the chance of necrosis of the overlying breast skin and other post‐surgery complications when compared to clinical evaluation only. The quality of studies used for this review is very low, meaning that we are not confident of the results. We need high‐quality studies that have randomised women to a group of ICGA assessment or clinical evaluation alone to have a more definitive answer.  What was studied in the review? Around 40% of women with breast cancer need to undergo mastectomy (removal of the whole breast). A skin‐sparing mastectomy is a common operation in which the overlying breast skin is preserved. After skin‐sparing mastectomy, women have the option to undergo reconstructive breast surgery. This operation carries some risks and complications, including an operation to correct complications (reoperation), spontaneous reopening of the surgical wound (dehiscence), infection, blood pooling outside of a blood vessel (haematoma) and a pocket filled with blood plasma underneath the skin (seroma).  Preserving the blood supply of the overlying breast skin during skin‐sparing mastectomy is crucial. When the blood supply is poor, skin will not survive, and surgeons need to intervene to prevent postoperative complications. Usually, the surgeon will assess tissue colour, the time taken for colour to return to the skin after pressure is applied (capillary refill), temperature, skin’s elasticity, and bleeding of the skin.  ICGA is a new imaging technique that assesses the blood supply to the tissue. It can assess blood flow in the overlying breast skin better than clinical judgement alone. We collected studies that compared the use of ICGA to clinical evaluation by a surgeon during immediate reconstructive breast surgery after skin‐sparing mastectomy. In these studies, women underwent immediate reconstructive surgery with their own tissue from another area of the woman’s body or with a breast implant.  What are the main results of this review? We found nine studies that compared the number of postoperative complications in women who had ICGA assessment of their breast skin versus clinical evaluation. Six studies were performed in the USA, two in Denmark and one in Japan. There were a total 1589 women with 2199 breast reconstructions. Studies reported the number of complications on a per patient basis or on a per breast basis. We present information based on both types of data.  The main results on a per patient analysis were that: ‐ICGA may reduce reoperation rates, and ‐we are uncertain as to whether ICGA has an effect on necrosis of the overlying skin of the breast, infection, haematoma and seroma rates. 
The main results on a per breast basis were that: ‐ICGA may reduce necrosis of the overlying skin of the breast, reoperation and infection rates, and ‐we are uncertain as to whether ICGA has an effect on haematoma and seroma rates.  The evidence contributing to this review topic is considered to be very low quality. Since randomised controlled trials are found to be one of the most powerful methods in clinical research, it is a major downside that these studies are missing. We emphasise the need for randomised controlled trials to further investigate the use of ICGA in reconstructive breast surgery.  How up‐to‐date is this review? Studies published up to April 2019 have been used for this review.

What was the aim of this review? To compare treatment with and without anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor (anti‐VEGF) medications for people with neovascular glaucoma (NVG). 
Key message It is uncertain whether treatment with anti‐VEGF medications is more beneficial than treatment without anti‐VEGF medications for people with NVG. More research is needed to investigate the long‐term effect of anti‐VEGF medications compared with, or in addition to, conventional treatment. 
What did we study in this review? VEGF is a protein produced by cells in your body, and produces new blood vessels when needed. When cells produce too much VEGF, abnormal blood vessels can grow in the eye. NVG is a type of glaucoma where the angle between the iris (coloured part of the eye) and the cornea (transparent front part of the eye) is closed by new blood vessels growing in the eye, hence, the name 'neovascular'. New blood vessels can cause scarring and narrowing, which can eventually lead to complete closure of the angle. This results in increased eye pressure since the fluid in the eye cannot drain properly. In NVG, the eye is often red and painful, and the vision is abnormal. High pressure in the eye can lead to blindness. 
Anti‐VEGF medication is a type of medicine that blocks VEGF, therefore, slowing the growth of blood vessels. It is administered by injection into the eye. It can be used early stage, when conventional treatment may not be possible. Most studies report short‐term (generally four to six weeks) benefits of anti‐VEGF medication, but long‐term benefits are not clear. 
What were the main results of this review? We included four studies enrolling a total of 263 participants with NVG. In one study, results beyond the treatment period of 1 week could not be evaluated. In another study, results were uncertain due to the limitation of study design. 
The last two studies reported different results for lowering eye pressure; one study showed inconclusive results, and the other study showed that anti‐VEGF medications were more effective. The certainty of the evidence in these studies was low, due to limitations in the study designs and inconsistency of results. Therefore, available evidence is insufficient to recommend the routine use of anti‐VEGF medication in individuals with NVG. 
How up to date is the review? We searched for studies that were published up to 22 March 2019.

Does a Special Eye Shot Help Treat a Serious Type of Glaucoma?

**Rationale**

Neovascular glaucoma is a serious eye problem. Our eyes have a drain that lets fluid flow out. This keeps the pressure inside the eye at a safe level. In neovascular glaucoma, new blood vessels grow inside the eye where they should not. These new blood vessels can act like a dam. They block the eye’s drain.

When the drain is blocked, fluid builds up. This makes the pressure inside the eye get too high. High eye pressure can cause a lot of pain and make the eye red. It can also damage the eye and harm your vision. If it is not treated, it can lead to blindness.

Researchers wanted to know if a special medicine could help. This medicine is called an anti-VEGF medicine. Our bodies make a protein called VEGF that helps new blood vessels grow. In this eye disease, the eye makes too much VEGF. The anti-VEGF medicine is a shot in the eye that blocks this protein. The goal is to stop the bad blood vessels from growing. This study looked at past research to see if this medicine really works for people with neovascular glaucoma.

**Trial Design**

This was not a new study with its own patients. Instead, the researchers looked at the results from other studies that were already finished. This kind of study is called a review. A review helps us see what most of the research says about a treatment.

The researchers found four studies to look at. A total of 263 people with neovascular glaucoma took part in these four studies. The studies in the review compared two groups of people. One group got the anti-VEGF medicine. The other group got a different treatment or no anti-VEGF medicine.

Most of these studies were short. They looked at what happened to patients for only a few weeks. The researchers wanted to see if the results from these different studies could give a clear answer.

**Results**

The review found that it is not clear if the anti-VEGF medicine helps more than other treatments. The results from the four studies were not consistent. This means they did not all show the same thing.

One of the studies was very short, only lasting for one week. This makes it hard to know if the medicine would help over a longer time. Another study had a weak design. This means we cannot be sure about its results.

The last two studies had different results. One study showed that the anti-VEGF medicine did help lower eye pressure. But the other study was not clear and did not show a real benefit. Because the studies were small and had different results, the proof that the medicine works is considered low.

Based on this review, there is not enough proof to say that all people with neovascular glaucoma should get this medicine. The researchers concluded that we need more and better studies. These new studies should follow patients for a much longer time to see if the eye shots provide a real, long-term benefit.","Anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor for neovascular glaucoma

10.1002-14651858.CD013180.pub2,"Background
Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is excessive menstrual blood loss that interferes with women's quality of life, regardless of the absolute amount of bleeding. It is a very common condition in women of reproductive age, affecting 2 to 5 of every 10 women. Diverse treatments, either medical (hormonal or non‐hormonal) or surgical, are currently available for HMB, with different effectiveness, acceptability, costs and side effects. The best treatment will depend on the woman's age, her intention to become pregnant, the presence of other symptoms, and her personal views and preferences. 
Objectives
To identify, systematically assess and summarise all evidence from studies included in Cochrane Reviews on treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), using reviews with comparable participants and outcomes; and to present a ranking of the first‐ and second‐line treatments for HMB. 
Methods
We searched for published Cochrane Reviews of HMB interventions in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The primary outcomes were menstrual bleeding and satisfaction. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, adverse events and the requirement of further treatment. Two review authors independently selected the systematic reviews, extracted data and assessed quality, resolving disagreements by discussion. We assessed review quality using the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2 tool and evaluated the certainty of the evidence for each outcome using GRADE methods. We grouped the interventions into first‐ and second‐line treatments, considering participant characteristics (desire for future pregnancy, failure of previous treatment, candidacy for surgery). First‐line treatments included medical interventions, and second‐line treatments included both the levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine system (LNG‐IUS) and surgical treatments; thus the LNG‐IUS is included in both groups. We developed different networks for first‐ and second‐line treatments. We performed network meta‐analyses of all outcomes, except for quality of life, where we performed pairwise meta‐analyses. We reported the mean rank, the network estimates for mean difference (MD) or odds ratio (OR), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and the certainty of evidence (moderate, low or very low certainty). 
We also analysed different endometrial ablation and resection techniques separately from the main network: transcervical endometrial resection (TCRE) with or without rollerball, other resectoscopic endometrial ablation (REA), microwave non‐resectoscopic endometrial ablation (NREA), hydrothermal ablation NREA, bipolar NREA, balloon NREA and other NREA. 
Main results
We included nine systematic reviews published in the Cochrane Library up to July 2021. We updated the reviews that were over two years old. In July 2020, we started the overview with no new reviews about the topic. The included medical interventions were: non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antifibrinolytics (tranexamic acid), combined oral contraceptives (COC), combined vaginal ring (CVR), long‐cycle and luteal oral progestogens, LNG‐IUS, ethamsylate and danazol (included to provide indirect evidence), which were compared to placebo. Surgical interventions were: open (abdominal), minimally invasive (vaginal or laparoscopic) and unspecified (or surgeon's choice of route of) hysterectomy, REA, NREA, unspecified endometrial ablation (EA) and LNG‐IUS. We grouped the interventions as follows. 
First‐line treatments 
Evidence from 26 studies with 1770 participants suggests that LNG‐IUS results in a large reduction of menstrual blood loss (MBL; mean rank 2.4, MD −105.71 mL/cycle, 95% CI −201.10 to −10.33; low certainty evidence); antifibrinolytics probably reduce MBL (mean rank 3.7, MD −80.32 mL/cycle, 95% CI −127.67 to −32.98; moderate certainty evidence); long‐cycle progestogen reduces MBL (mean rank 4.1, MD −76.93 mL/cycle, 95% CI −153.82 to −0.05; low certainty evidence), and NSAIDs slightly reduce MBL (mean rank 6.4, MD −40.67 mL/cycle, −84.61 to 3.27; low certainty evidence; reference comparator mean rank 8.9). We are uncertain of the true effect of the remaining interventions and the sensitivity analysis for reduction of MBL, as the evidence was rated as very low certainty. 
We are uncertain of the true effect of any intervention (very low certainty evidence) on the perception of improvement and satisfaction. 
Second‐line treatments 
Bleeding reduction is related to the type of hysterectomy (total or supracervical/subtotal), not the route, so we combined all routes of hysterectomy for bleeding outcomes. We assessed the reduction of MBL without imputed data (11 trials, 1790 participants) and with imputed data (15 trials, 2241 participants). Evidence without imputed data suggests that hysterectomy (mean rank 1.2, OR 25.71, 95% CI 1.50 to 439.96; low certainty evidence) and REA (mean rank 2.8, OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.29 to 5.66; low certainty evidence) result in a large reduction of MBL, and NREA probably results in a large reduction of MBL (mean rank 2.0, OR 3.32, 95% CI 1.53 to 7.23; moderate certainty evidence). Evidence with imputed data suggests hysterectomy results in a large reduction of MBL (mean rank 1.0, OR 14.31, 95% CI 2.99 to 68.56; low certainty evidence), and NREA probably results in a large reduction of MBL (mean rank 2.2, OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.29 to 6.05; moderate certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the true effect for REA (very low certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effect on amenorrhoea (very low certainty evidence). 
Evidence from 27 trials with 4284 participants suggests that minimally invasive hysterectomy results in a large increase in satisfaction (mean rank 1.3, OR 7.96, 95% CI 3.33 to 19.03; low certainty evidence), and NREA also increases satisfaction (mean rank 3.6, OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.33; low certainty evidence), but we are uncertain of the true effect of the remaining interventions (very low certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence suggests LNG‐IUS is the best first‐line treatment for reducing menstrual blood loss (MBL); antifibrinolytics are probably the second best, and long‐cycle progestogens are likely the third best. We cannot make conclusions about the effect of first‐line treatments on perception of improvement and satisfaction, as evidence was rated as very low certainty. For second‐line treatments, evidence suggests hysterectomy is the best treatment for reducing bleeding, followed by REA and NREA. We are uncertain of the effect on amenorrhoea, as evidence was rated as very low certainty. Minimally invasive hysterectomy may result in a large increase in satisfaction, and NREA also increases satisfaction, but we are uncertain of the true effect of the remaining second‐line interventions, as evidence was rated as very low certainty.

Which Treatments Work Best for Heavy Periods?

### **Rationale**
**What are heavy periods?**
Heavy periods are when you lose a lot of blood during your monthly cycle. This condition is also called heavy menstrual bleeding. It is a common problem. It affects 2 to 5 of every 10 women.

Heavy periods can make it hard to do daily activities. They can affect your physical, social, and emotional life. There are many ways to treat heavy periods. These include medicines and surgery.

**Why was this study done?**
There are many treatment choices. This can make it hard to pick the best one. The right choice can depend on your age and health. It also depends on if you want to get pregnant in the future.

Researchers wanted to find out which treatments work best. They looked at past studies to compare the different options. This review helps women and their doctors choose the best treatment for heavy periods.

### **Trial Design**
**How was this study designed?**
This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of many past studies. This is called a review. It lets us see what all the research says when put together.

The researchers searched for high-quality studies. They found nine large reviews of studies. These studies included thousands of women with heavy periods.

The researchers grouped the treatments into two types:
*   **First-line treatments:** These are the options you might try first. They are mostly medicines. They are for women who may want to have children later.
*   **Second-line treatments:** These are options for when first-line treatments do not work. They often include surgery. They are for women who do not plan to get pregnant.

The researchers looked at two main things. They looked at which treatments reduced bleeding the most. They also looked at which treatments made women feel most satisfied.

### **Results**
**What were the main results of the study?**
The study found which treatments worked best for heavy periods. The results are split into the two types of treatment.

**First-Line Treatments (Medicines and a special device)**
These treatments are often tried first.

*   The best treatment to reduce bleeding was the **LNG-IUS**. This is a small T-shaped device. A doctor places it in your womb, also called the uterus. It slowly releases a hormone to reduce bleeding.
*   The second-best treatment was a type of medicine. This medicine helps your blood to clot. This reduces how much you bleed.
*   The third-best option was a hormone pill called a progestogen.

The researchers were not sure how these treatments affected how satisfied women felt. There was not enough information to be certain.

**Second-Line Treatments (Surgery and a special device)**
These treatments are used if the first ones do not work.

*   The best treatment to reduce or stop bleeding was a **hysterectomy**. This is an operation to remove the womb. After this surgery, you no longer have periods. You also cannot get pregnant.
*   Other good options were procedures to remove the lining of the womb. This is called **endometrial ablation**. This also reduces bleeding a lot.
*   For making women feel satisfied, hysterectomy worked very well. This was especially true when it was done with small cuts. The procedures to remove the womb lining also helped women feel more satisfied with their treatment.

**What did the researchers conclude?**
For women trying treatment for the first time, the LNG-IUS device is the best choice to reduce heavy bleeding.

For women who need a second treatment, surgery works best. A hysterectomy is the best option to stop bleeding and improve satisfaction. Procedures to remove the womb lining are also good choices. This information can help you and your doctor decide on the best plan for you.","Which is the best treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding?
Key results 
Evidence suggests that the levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine system (LNG‐IUS) is the best first‐line option for reducing menstrual bleeding, while antifibrinolytics are probably the second best, and long‐cycle progestogens are the third best. Because of some limitations in the evidence, we are not sure what the true effect of these first‐line treatments is for the perception of improvement and satisfaction. 
For second‐line treatments, evidence suggests any type of hysterectomy is the best treatment for reducing bleeding, even though this is a major surgery, and resectoscopic endometrial ablation (REA) and non‐resectoscopic endometrial ablation (NREA) are second and third best. We are uncertain of the true effect of the second‐line treatments on amenorrhoea (absence of menstrual blood loss). Evidence suggests that minimally invasive hysterectomy results in a large increase in satisfaction, and NREA increases satisfaction, but we are uncertain of the true effect of the remaining interventions. 
What is heavy menstrual bleeding? 
Heavy menstrual bleeding is defined as excessive menstrual blood loss that interferes with the quality of life of people who menstruate. It is very common and can affect 20% to 50% of people who menstruate during their reproductive years. There are different treatments available, each with their own pros and cons. The best treatment depends on the person's age, whether they have or want to have children, their personal preferences, and their medical history, among other things. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to get an overview of all the published evidence on different treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding. We were most interested in finding out if the treatments were effective for reducing menstrual bleeding and for improving women's satisfaction. We also wanted to know how the treatment affected quality of life, what side effects it caused, and whether women required further treatment. 
What did we do? 
This study is an overview of reviews, which means we looked for published studies that synthesised the results of other studies on different treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding. Then we tried to give a broad overview of all that evidence. We analysed the certainty of the evidence based on factors like study size and methodological rigour. We categorised the treatments based on patient characteristics, including the desire (intention) for future pregnancy, failure of previous treatment or having been referred for surgery. First‐line treatment included medical interventions and second‐line treatment included the LNG‐IUS plus surgical interventions; thus, the LNG‐IUS was included in both first‐ and second‐line treatments. We used network meta‐analysis, a statistical method that compares all the interventions at the same time, to find out which treatments produced the best results for patients. 
What did we find? 
We found nine reviews with 104 studies, involving a total of 11,881 participants. Altogether, the data we analysed came from 85 trials and 9950 participants. The medical interventions included were: non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antifibrinolytics (tranexamic acid), combined oral contraceptives (COC), combined vaginal ring (CVR), long‐cycle and luteal oral progestogens, the LNG‐IUS, ethamsylate and danazol (included only to provide indirect evidence). These were compared to placebo (sham treatment). The surgical interventions included were: open (abdominal), minimally invasive (vaginal or laparoscopic) and unspecified (or surgeon's choice of) route of hysterectomy, REA, NREA and unspecified endometrial ablation (EA). 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in some evidence is moderate, but for most of it, our confidence is low to very low. The main reasons were because the studies were often not blinded, which means the participants knew which treatment they were receiving, and that could have changed their perception; the direct and indirect evidence was not similar enough to compare in the network; and the range of the results was too wide. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The last search for reviews was in July 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD007077.pub4,"Partial breast irradiation for early breast cancer
What is the issue? 
Breast cancer is the most common cancer that women get.
Women with early breast cancer who choose to keep their breast need to have radiotherapy (RT) as well as surgery to remove the cancer to make sure it does not regrow in the breast. RT is treatment with high energy x‐rays. Having RT for breast cancer usually means 15 to 30 visits to the RT department, five times per week. 
If breast cancer does regrow in the same breast (called local recurrence), it tends to come back in the area it was removed from. Women can also grow a new cancer (new 'elsewhere primary') in another part of the same breast. We are not sure if the RT given to stop cancer regrowth where the first cancer was, stops the growth of 'elsewhere primaries.' 
Why does it matter? 
We always want to treat the smallest area we can with RT because this means fewer side effects. Treating only part of the breast could mean that RT might be able to be used again in another part of the same breast if needed. New ways of giving RT mean that treating part of the breast can be done with fewer treatments. This is likely to be easier for women and cost less money. 
What did we compare? 
We asked if giving RT to part of the breast (called partial breast irradiation (PBI)) is as good as giving RT to the whole breast. PBI can be given with a shortened treatment duration (called accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI)). 
For this treatment to be acceptable, it would need to control the cancer as well as giving RT to the whole breast does. It would also be important that the PBI gives about the same side effects and breast appearance as treating the whole breast. 
What did we find? 
We found nine studies, which involved 15,187 women. Our evidence is current to 27 August 2020. Local recurrence is probably slightly more common with APBI/PBI (moderate‐quality evidence) and the breast appearance (scored by doctors and nurses) was probably worse with APBI/PBI (moderate‐quality evidence). There is probably little difference in survival (high‐quality evidence). Late radiation fibrosis (change in breast appearance and feel) is probably increased with APBI/PBI. There are probably few differences in breast cancer‐related deaths and spread of breast cancer around the body with the use of APBI/PBI. The use of APBI/PBI makes little difference to how many women need mastectomy (removal of the whole breast) because of unacceptable late side effects or local recurrence. 
What do our findings mean? 
This means that at the moment, PBI does not give the same cancer control in the breast as treating the whole breast, but the difference is small. It may cause worse side effects. There are seven big ongoing studies that will be important to answer this question. We hope to have a clearer answer in the next update of this review. 
","Here is a Plain Language Summary based on the provided abstract.

### **Plain Title**

Treating Part of the Breast or the Whole Breast for Early Breast Cancer?

### **Rationale**

Breast cancer is a common type of cancer in women. When a woman has early-stage breast cancer, she can often have surgery to remove the cancer and keep her breast. After surgery, women usually need a treatment called radiation therapy. Radiation uses high-energy x-rays to kill any cancer cells that might be left. This helps stop the cancer from coming back in the breast.

The usual radiation treatment can take a long time. A woman might need to go to the hospital five days a week for several weeks. This can be very hard on a person’s daily life.

Doctors noticed that when breast cancer does come back, it often grows in the same area where it was first removed. This made them ask an important question. Do we need to treat the whole breast with radiation? Or could we just treat the part of the breast where the cancer was? This study was needed to see if treating a smaller area is as good and safe as treating the whole breast. A shorter treatment on a smaller area could mean fewer side effects and be much easier for patients.

### **Trial Design**

This was a review study. This means the researchers did not do a new experiment. Instead, they gathered and studied the results from other completed studies. This helps them get a stronger, more reliable answer.

The researchers looked at nine different studies. In total, these studies included more than 15,000 women. All the women had early-stage breast cancer and had surgery to save their breast.

The studies compared two groups of women. One group got the usual treatment of radiation to the whole breast. The other group got radiation to only part of their breast. This is called partial breast irradiation. The researchers looked at what happened to the women in both groups to see which treatment was better.

### **Results**

The researchers found some small but important differences between the two treatments.

*   **Cancer Returning:** The cancer was slightly more likely to come back in the same breast for women who had radiation to only part of the breast.
*   **Survival:** The good news is that there was almost no difference in how long women lived. Both treatments were very good at helping women survive breast cancer. The chance of the cancer spreading to other parts of the body was also the same for both groups.
*   **Side Effects and Appearance:** The appearance of the breast was sometimes worse in the group that got treatment to only part of the breast. This was what doctors and nurses reported. A long-term side effect that makes the breast tissue feel hard or firm was also more common in this group.
*   **Need for More Surgery:** About the same number of women in both groups needed to have their whole breast removed later on.

Based on these results, the researchers concluded that, for now, treating only part of the breast is not quite as good at stopping the cancer from coming back in the breast. The difference is small, but treating the whole breast seems to work a little better. Also, treating part of the breast may cause worse long-term side effects on how the breast looks and feels.

There are seven large studies still going on to learn more. These studies will give us a clearer answer in the future.","Partial breast irradiation for early breast cancer

Review question: We reviewed the evidence about the effect of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy on the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. We found 13 studies including 9059 participants. 
Background: We wanted to discover whether using fixed‐dose combination therapy was better or worse than other alternatives, such as usual care, placebo, or giving drugs separately, for the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. This report represents an update from a previous review published in 2014. 
Study characteristics: The evidence is current to September 2016. Four studies included individuals with a prior heart attack or stroke or with a high predicted risk for having an initial heart attack and five studies had long‐term (12 months or more) follow‐up. The main risk of bias was related to lack of blinding of participants and personnel, which was inherent to the intervention. Most study participants were middle‐aged men with moderate elevations in blood pressure or cholesterol. Two studies specifically included ethnic Aboriginal or Maori minorities in half of the study participants. The fixed‐dose combinations ranged from two to five drugs; all studies included at least one blood pressure‐lowering and one cholesterol‐lowering drug. 
Key results: The effects of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy on all‐cause mortality and fatal and non‐fatal heart attacks and strokes are uncertain, primarily due to the low number of participants experiencing these events in these studies (fewer than 5% for both) and comparisons with usual care (low‐quality evidence). Fixed‐dose combination drug therapy leads to more adverse events than control (32% versus 27%), including placebo (moderate‐quality evidence). This information is not surprising since aspirin, blood pressure‐lowering drugs and cholesterol drugs are known to increase the risk for side effects compared with placebo. Fixed‐dose combination therapy may modestly lower blood pressure (˜6 mmHg) and cholesterol (‐0.6 mmol/L in LDL cholesterol), but these effects were not consistent (moderate‐quality evidence for blood pressure and LDL cholesterol but low‐quality evidence of total cholesterol). Fixed‐dose combination therapy appears to improve adherence to medications to prevent ASCVD (moderate‐quality evidence). 
Quality of the evidence: The quality of evidence from these studies generally ranged from moderate to low. Ongoing trials of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy will likely inform clinical endpoints to guide decision‐making.

Using One Pill with Many Medicines to Prevent Heart Attacks and Strokes

### **Rationale**

Heart attacks and strokes are serious health problems. They can happen when your blood pressure or cholesterol levels are too high. High blood pressure and high cholesterol can harm the vessels that carry blood to your heart and brain. Many people die or have lifelong problems because of heart attacks and strokes.

Doctors often give people several different medicines to lower their blood pressure and cholesterol. It can be hard to remember to take many pills every day. To make it easier, some pills combine a few different medicines into one single pill. This is called a combo pill.

Researchers wanted to know if using a combo pill is a good way to prevent heart attacks and strokes. They looked at past studies to see if a combo pill works better than usual care from a doctor. They also compared it to taking no medicine or taking each medicine as a separate pill. This study was needed to find simpler ways to help people stay healthy.

### **Trial Design**

This was a review study. This means the researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they gathered and looked at the results from 13 older studies that were already finished. This helped them see what all the studies found when looked at together.

In total, these 13 studies included more than 9,000 people. Most of the people in the studies were middle-aged men. They had slightly high blood pressure or high cholesterol. Some people in the studies had already had a heart attack or stroke in the past. Two of the studies included native people from Australia and New Zealand.

The people in these studies took a combo pill. The pills had between two and five different medicines mixed together. All of the combo pills had at least one medicine to lower blood pressure and one to lower cholesterol. Some of the studies watched the people for a long time, for at least one year.

### **Results**

The researchers found that it was not clear if the combo pill helped prevent heart attacks or strokes. It was also not clear if it helped people live longer. This was because very few people in the studies had these health problems. Less than 5 out of every 100 people had a heart attack or stroke during the studies. When so few events happen, it is hard to be sure if a medicine made a difference.

The study did find some good things. People who took the combo pill were more likely to take their medicine as their doctor ordered. It is easier for people to remember to take one pill than to take many pills. The combo pill also helped to lower blood pressure and ""bad"" cholesterol a little bit. However, these small changes were not seen in every study.

The combo pill also had some downsides. People who took the combo pill had more side effects. For every 100 people who took the combo pill, about 32 had side effects. For every 100 people who took a sugar pill or got usual care, about 27 had side effects. This is not a surprise, as the medicines used to lower blood pressure and cholesterol are known to cause some side effects.

The researchers concluded that the information from these studies was not of the best quality. Because of this, we still do not know for sure if combo pills are a good way to prevent heart attacks and strokes. More and better studies are needed to give us a clear answer.","Fixed‐dose combination drug therapy for the prevention of heart disease and stroke

10.1002-14651858.CD013705.pub3,"Background
Accurate rapid diagnostic tests for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection would be a useful tool to help manage the COVID‐19 pandemic. Testing strategies that use rapid antigen tests to detect current infection have the potential to increase access to testing, speed detection of infection, and inform clinical and public health management decisions to reduce transmission. This is the second update of this review, which was first published in 2020. 
Objectives
To assess the diagnostic accuracy of rapid, point‐of‐care antigen tests for diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. We consider accuracy separately in symptomatic and asymptomatic population groups. Sources of heterogeneity investigated included setting and indication for testing, assay format, sample site, viral load, age, timing of test, and study design. 
Search methods
We searched the COVID‐19 Open Access Project living evidence database from the University of Bern (which includes daily updates from PubMed and Embase and preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv) on 08 March 2021. We included independent evaluations from national reference laboratories, FIND and the Diagnostics Global Health website. We did not apply language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included studies of people with either suspected SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, known SARS‐CoV‐2 infection or known absence of infection, or those who were being screened for infection. We included test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated commercially produced, rapid antigen tests. We included evaluations of single applications of a test (one test result reported per person) and evaluations of serial testing (repeated antigen testing over time). Reference standards for presence or absence of infection were any laboratory‐based molecular test (primarily reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR)) or pre‐pandemic respiratory sample. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard screening procedures with three people. Two people independently carried out quality assessment (using the QUADAS‐2 tool) and extracted study results. Other study characteristics were extracted by one review author and checked by a second. We present sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each test, and pooled data using the bivariate model. We investigated heterogeneity by including indicator variables in the random‐effects logistic regression models. We tabulated results by test manufacturer and compliance with manufacturer instructions for use and according to symptom status. 
Main results
We included 155 study cohorts (described in 166 study reports, with 24 as preprints). The main results relate to 152 evaluations of single test applications including 100,462 unique samples (16,822 with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2). Studies were mainly conducted in Europe (101/152, 66%), and evaluated 49 different commercial antigen assays. Only 23 studies compared two or more brands of test. 
Risk of bias was high because of participant selection (40, 26%); interpretation of the index test (6, 4%); weaknesses in the reference standard for absence of infection (119, 78%); and participant flow and timing 41 (27%). Characteristics of participants (45, 30%) and index test delivery (47, 31%) differed from the way in which and in whom the test was intended to be used. Nearly all studies (91%) used a single RT‐PCR result to define presence or absence of infection. 
The 152 studies of single test applications reported 228 evaluations of antigen tests. Estimates of sensitivity varied considerably between studies, with consistently high specificities. Average sensitivity was higher in symptomatic (73.0%, 95% CI 69.3% to 76.4%; 109 evaluations; 50,574 samples, 11,662 cases) compared to asymptomatic participants (54.7%, 95% CI 47.7% to 61.6%; 50 evaluations; 40,956 samples, 2641 cases). Average sensitivity was higher in the first week after symptom onset (80.9%, 95% CI 76.9% to 84.4%; 30 evaluations, 2408 cases) than in the second week of symptoms (53.8%, 95% CI 48.0% to 59.6%; 40 evaluations, 1119 cases). For those who were asymptomatic at the time of testing, sensitivity was higher when an epidemiological exposure to SARS‐CoV‐2 was suspected (64.3%, 95% CI 54.6% to 73.0%; 16 evaluations; 7677 samples, 703 cases) compared to where COVID‐19 testing was reported to be widely available to anyone on presentation for testing (49.6%, 95% CI 42.1% to 57.1%; 26 evaluations; 31,904 samples, 1758 cases). Average specificity was similarly high for symptomatic (99.1%) or asymptomatic (99.7%) participants. 
We observed a steady decline in summary sensitivities as measures of sample viral load decreased. 
Sensitivity varied between brands. When tests were used according to manufacturer instructions, average sensitivities by brand ranged from 34.3% to 91.3% in symptomatic participants (20 assays with eligible data) and from 28.6% to 77.8% for asymptomatic participants (12 assays). For symptomatic participants, summary sensitivities for seven assays were 80% or more (meeting acceptable criteria set by the World Health Organization (WHO)). The WHO acceptable performance criterion of 97% specificity was met by 17 of 20 assays when tests were used according to manufacturer instructions, 12 of which demonstrated specificities above 99%. For asymptomatic participants the sensitivities of only two assays approached but did not meet WHO acceptable performance standards in one study each; specificities for asymptomatic participants were in a similar range to those observed for symptomatic people. 
At 5% prevalence using summary data in symptomatic people during the first week after symptom onset, the positive predictive value (PPV) of 89% means that 1 in 10 positive results will be a false positive, and around 1 in 5 cases will be missed. At 0.5% prevalence using summary data for asymptomatic people, where testing was widely available and where epidemiological exposure to COVID‐19 was suspected, resulting PPVs would be 38% to 52%, meaning that between 2 in 5 and 1 in 2 positive results will be false positives, and between 1 in 2 and 1 in 3 cases will be missed. 
Authors' conclusions
Antigen tests vary in sensitivity. In people with signs and symptoms of COVID‐19, sensitivities are highest in the first week of illness when viral loads are higher. Assays that meet appropriate performance standards, such as those set by WHO, could replace laboratory‐based RT‐PCR when immediate decisions about patient care must be made, or where RT‐PCR cannot be delivered in a timely manner. However, they are more suitable for use as triage to RT‐PCR testing. The variable sensitivity of antigen tests means that people who test negative may still be infected. Many commercially available rapid antigen tests have not been evaluated in independent validation studies. 
Evidence for testing in asymptomatic cohorts has increased, however sensitivity is lower and there is a paucity of evidence for testing in different settings. Questions remain about the use of antigen test‐based repeat testing strategies. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of screening programmes at reducing transmission of infection, whether mass screening or targeted approaches including schools, healthcare setting and traveller screening.

How Good Are Rapid Tests for Finding the COVID-19 Virus?

***

**Rationale**

**What is the problem?**

COVID-19 is an illness caused by a virus. It spread quickly around the world. To slow the spread, we needed fast and easy ways to test people.

Very accurate lab tests, called PCR tests, can take a long time to give results. Faster tests, called rapid antigen tests, can give results in minutes. These tests could help find the virus sooner. This would help people know if they need to stay home to avoid spreading the virus.

**Why was this study done?**

Researchers wanted to know how well these rapid tests work. They wanted to see if the tests could correctly find who has the virus and who does not. This study looked at many different brands of rapid tests.

The researchers thought that rapid tests might work better for people who have signs of being sick. These signs are called symptoms. They also thought the tests might work better early in the illness. This is because people may have more of the virus in their body at that time.

***

**Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers reviewed 155 past studies on rapid tests. By combining the results, they could get a better idea of how well the tests work.

The studies included over 100,000 people from all over the world. Some people in the studies had symptoms of COVID-19, like a cough or fever. Other people had no symptoms at all. The studies compared the results from rapid tests to the results from the more accurate lab tests.

Each person in the studies took a rapid test. They also gave a sample for a lab test. The researchers then checked to see how often the rapid test result matched the lab test result.

***

**Results**

**What did the study find?**

The study found that the accuracy of rapid tests was very different from test to test. In general, the tests were better at finding the virus in people who felt sick than in people who did not.

**How well did the tests work for people with symptoms?**

For people with symptoms, the rapid tests found the virus in about 7 out of 10 sick people. The tests worked best during the first week a person felt sick. In that first week, they found the virus in about 8 out of 10 sick people. After the first week, the tests only found the virus in about 5 out of 10 sick people.

**How well did the tests work for people with no symptoms?**

For people with no symptoms, the rapid tests were not as good. They found the virus in about 5 or 6 out of 10 people who were infected but did not feel sick.

**What about wrong test results?**

A test can sometimes be wrong in two ways:

*   **A ""false positive""** is when the test says you have the virus, but you really do not. The rapid tests were very good at avoiding this. Almost everyone who did not have the virus got a correct negative result. But for someone with symptoms, about 1 in 10 positive results could be wrong.

*   **A ""false negative""** is when the test says you do not have the virus, but you really do. This was more common. For people with symptoms in their first week of sickness, about 1 in 5 sick people might get a wrong negative result. For people with no symptoms, even more sick people could be missed by the tests.

**What do these results mean?**

Rapid tests can be useful when you need a result quickly. But they are not as accurate as lab tests. Some rapid test brands work much better than others.

A negative result from a rapid test does not always mean you are not infected. You could still have the virus and be able to spread it to others.

The researchers concluded that we need more studies on how to best use these tests. This is especially true for testing people who do not have any symptoms.","How accurate are rapid antigen tests for diagnosing COVID‐19?
Key messages 
• Rapid antigen tests are most accurate when they are used in people who have signs or symptoms of COVID‐19, especially during the first week of illness. People who test negative may still be infected. 
• Rapid antigen tests are considerably less accurate when they are used in people with no signs or symptoms of infection, but do perform better in people who have been in contact with someone who has confirmed COVID‐19. 
• The accuracy of rapid antigen tests varies between tests that are produced by different manufacturers and there is a lack of evidence for many commercially available tests. 
What are rapid point‐of‐care antigen tests for COVID‐19? 
Rapid point‐of‐care tests aim to confirm or rule out COVID‐19 infection in people with or without COVID‐19 symptoms. They: 
• are portable, so they can be used wherever the patient is (at the point‐of‐care) or in non‐healthcare settings such as in the home; 
• are easy to perform, with a minimum amount of extra equipment or complicated preparation steps; 
• are less expensive than standard laboratory tests;
• do not require a specialist operator or setting; and
• provide results ‘while you wait’.
For this review we were interested in rapid antigen tests, sometimes referred to as ‘lateral flow tests’. These tests identify proteins on the virus in samples taken from the nose or throat. They come in disposable plastic cassettes, similar to over‐the‐counter pregnancy tests. 
Why is this question important? 
People with suspected COVID‐19 need to know quickly whether they are infected, so that they can self‐isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. Currently, COVID‐19 infection is confirmed by a laboratory test called RT‐PCR, which uses specialist equipment and often takes at least 24 hours to produce a result. 
In many places, rapid antigen tests have opened access to testing for many more people, with and without symptoms, and in locations other than healthcare settings. Faster diagnosis of COVID‐19 infection could allow people to take appropriate action more quickly, with the potential to reduce the spread of COVID‐19, but it is important to understand how accurate they are and the best way to use them. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether commercially available, rapid point‐of‐care antigen tests are accurate enough to diagnose COVID‐19 infection reliably, and to find out if accuracy differs in people with and without symptoms. 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies that measured the accuracy of any commercially produced rapid antigen test in people who were also tested for COVID‐19 using RT‐PCR. People could be tested in hospital, in the community or in their own homes. Studies could test people with or without symptoms. 
What did we find? 
We included 155 studies in the review. The main results are based on 152 studies investigating a total of 100,462 nose or throat samples; COVID‐19 was confirmed in 16,822 of these samples. Studies investigated 49 different antigen tests. Around 60% of studies took place in Europe. 
Main results 
In people with confirmed COVID‐19, antigen tests correctly identified COVID‐19 infection in an average of 73% of people with symptoms, compared to 55% of people without symptoms. Tests were most accurate when used in the first week after symptoms began (an average of 82% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). This is likely to be because people have the most virus in their system in the first days after they are infected. For people with no symptoms, tests were most accurate in people likely to have been in contact with a case of COVID‐19 infection (an average of 64% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). 
In people who did not have COVID‐19, antigen tests correctly ruled out infection in 99.6% of people with symptoms and 99.7% of people without symptoms. 
Different brands of tests varied in accuracy. Summary results (combined from more than one study per test brand) for seven tests met World Health Organization (WHO) standards as ‘acceptable’ for confirming and ruling out COVID‐19 in people with signs and symptoms of COVID‐19. Two more tests met the WHO acceptable standard in one study each. No test met this standard when evaluated in people without symptoms. 
Using summary results for symptomatic people tested during the first week after symptoms began, if 1000 people with symptoms had the antigen test, and 50 (5%) of them really had COVID‐19: 
• 45 people would test positive for COVID‐19. Of these, 5 people (11%) would not have COVID‐19 (false positive result). 
• 955 people would test negative for COVID‐19. Of these, 10 people (1.0%) would actually have COVID‐19 (false negative result). 
In people with no symptoms of COVID‐19 the number of confirmed cases is expected to be much lower than in people with symptoms. Using summary results for people with no known exposure to COVID‐19 in a bigger population of 10,000 people with no symptoms, where 50 (0.5%) of them really had COVID‐19: 
• 62 people would test positive for COVID‐19. Of these, 30 people (48%) would not have COVID‐19 (false positive result). 
• 9938 people would test negative for COVID‐19. Of these, 18 people (0.2%) would actually have COVID‐19 (false negative result). 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
In general, studies used relatively rigorous methods, particularly for selecting participants and performing the tests. Sometimes studies did not perform the test on the people for whom it was intended and did not follow the manufacturers’ instructions for using the test. Sometimes the tests were not carried out at the point of care. Studies used less rigorous methods for confirming the presence or absence of COVID‐19 infection; 91% of studies relied on a single negative RT‐PCR result as evidence of no COVID‐19 infection. Results from different test brands varied, and relatively few studies directly compared one test brand with another. Finally, not all studies gave enough information about their participants for us to judge how long they had had symptoms, or even whether or not they had symptoms. 
What does this mean? 
In people with symptoms, some rapid antigen tests are accurate enough to replace RT‐PCR, especially for ruling in the presence of infection. Alternatively, where RT‐PCR is available, rapid antigen tests could be used to select which people with symptoms require further testing with RT‐PCR, thereby reducing the burden on laboratory services. This would be most useful when quick decisions are needed about patient care, to identify outbreaks, to allow people to self‐isolate more quickly, or to initiate contact tracing. Rapid antigen tests are less good at ruling out infection in symptomatic people ‐ individuals who receive a negative rapid antigen test result may still be infected. 
Rapid antigen tests are less accurate when used in people with no symptoms of COVID‐19. More evidence is needed to understand the accuracy of rapid testing in people without symptoms and the extent to which repeated testing strategies can lead to reduced transmission, either for tests carried out at home or in non‐healthcare settings such as schools. There is no independent evidence to support the use of many test brands. More direct comparisons of test brands are needed, with testers following manufacturers’ instructions.

Atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) and vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) are severe and potentially sight‐threatening allergic eye diseases characterised by chronic inflammation of the ocular surface. Both topical and systemic treatments are used. This Cochrane Review focuses on systemic treatments. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of systemic treatments (including corticosteroids, NSAIDS, immunomodulators, and monoclonal antibodies), alone or in combination, compared to placebo or other systemic or topical treatment, for severe AKC and VKC in children and young people up to the age of 16 years. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the ISRCTN registry, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). There were no restrictions to language or year of publication. We last searched the electronic databases on 17 February 2020. 
Selection criteria
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that involved systemic treatments in children aged up to 16 years with a clinical diagnosis of AKC or VKC. We planned to include studies that evaluated a single systemic medication versus placebo, and studies that compared two or multiple active treatments. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methods expected by Cochrane.
Main results
No trial met the inclusion criteria of this Cochrane Review. No RCTs have been carried out on this topic. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently no evidence from randomised controlled trials regarding the safety and efficacy of systemic treatments for VKC and AKC. Trials are required to test efficacy and safety of current and future treatments. Outcome measures need to be developed which can capture both objective clinical and patient‐reported aspects of the condition and treatments.

A Search for the Best Body-Wide Medicines for Severe Eye Allergies in Children

**Rationale**

Some children have very serious eye allergies. Two of these are called atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) and vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC). These conditions can make the eyes red, itchy, and swollen for a long time. They can be very painful and uncomfortable. In serious cases, they can even damage a child's eyesight.

Doctors use different kinds of medicine to help. Some medicines are eye drops that you put right on the eye. Other medicines are pills or shots. These work on the whole body, not just the eyes, to calm down the allergy. We call these “body-wide” medicines.

Researchers wanted to find out which of these body-wide medicines work best for children with these serious eye allergies. They also wanted to know how safe these medicines are. To do this, they planned to look for all the best medical studies that had already been done on this topic.

**Trial Design**

This was not a study with new patients. Instead, the researchers did a review. A review means they searched for studies that were already finished to combine all the information in one place.

The researchers were looking for a specific type of study. These are called randomized controlled trials, or RCTs. RCTs are the best way for us to know if a medicine truly works and is safe.

Here is how an RCT works. People in the study are put into different groups by chance, like flipping a coin. One group gets the real medicine being tested. Another group might get a fake medicine, like a sugar pill. Doctors then compare the groups to see if the real medicine helped more.

The researchers looked for RCTs that included children. The children in the studies had to be 16 years old or younger. They also had to have one of the serious eye allergies, AKC or VKC.

**Results**

The researchers searched through many large collections of medical studies. After looking very carefully, they found a surprising result. They did not find any studies that matched what they were looking for.

This means that they found zero high-quality studies (RCTs) about using body-wide medicine for these serious eye allergies in children.

Because no studies were found, we do not have strong proof to guide doctors and families. We cannot be sure from the best kind of evidence how well these body-wide medicines work for children with these conditions. We also do not have strong proof from these studies about how safe the medicines are for them.

The researchers concluded that there is a big gap in what we know. More research is needed to help children with these painful eye allergies. New, high-quality studies like RCTs should be done. These studies will help us test if current and new body-wide medicines are safe and if they work for children.

The researchers also said we need better ways to check if a treatment is helping. This means doctors should look at the eye to see if it is better. It also means we need to ask children and their families how they feel. Hearing from patients about what is getting better is very important.","What medicines, taken by mouth or given as an injection, work best to treat severe allergic eye disease in children and young people under 16 years old? 
What is allergic eye disease? An immune response is how the body recognises and defends itself against substances that appear harmful, usually by producing specific blood proteins (antibodies) against them. An allergy is a reaction by the body's immune system to a particular substance (an allergen) that is usually harmless, such as grass or tree pollens in the air. Different allergens affect different tissues, and their effects can be mild or serious. 
In the eye, allergic reactions can cause conjunctivitis: the conjunctiva (the tissue covering the white of the eye and lining the inside of the eyelids) becomes swollen and sore. Severe allergic eye disease may also affect the cornea (the clear, front part of the eye), causing keratoconjunctivitis. 
Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) are rare types of severe allergic eye disease. VKC usually develops in children and is more common in boys; AKC can affect children and adults. These conditions usually affect both eyes and make them red, itchy, sore, watery and sensitive to light. Both conditions can damage the cornea, which can affect eyesight and lead to blindness. Treatment is essential to save eyesight. 
Treatments for severe allergic eye disease Both conditions are treated with medicines that try to block the allergic reaction and reduce swelling. Symptoms may get better with medicines given as eye drops, but if these don't work, other medicines may be taken by mouth or given as an injection (systemic medicines). Systemic medicines that are often used to treat severe allergic eye disease include ones that target or suppress the immune response, such as anti‑inflammatory medicines and antibodies. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review We wanted to find out which systemic treatments work best for severe allergic eye disease in children and young people. 
What did we do?We searched for studies that looked at systemic medicines to treat severe allergic eye disease in children and young people under 16 years of age. We wanted to find studies that compared a single medicine with a placebo (dummy) medicine, or studies that compared two or more medicines against each other. 
We looked for randomised controlled studies, in which the treatments people received were decided at random, because these studies usually give the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. 
Search date: We searched for evidence published up to 17 February 2020. 
What we foundWe found no randomised controlled studies in children and young people with severe allergic eye disease treated by systemic medicines. 
Conclusions 
There is no evidence from randomised controlled studies about how well systemic medicines work for severe allergic eye disease in children and young people aged under 16 years. 
Research is needed to investigate how well systemic medicines work to treat severe allergic eye disease in children and young people, and to learn about any unwanted effects these medicines might cause.

Infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS) is a type of eye movement disorder that can negatively impact vision. Currently, INS cannot be cured, but its effects can potentially be treated pharmacologically, optically, or surgically. This review focuses on the surgical interventions for INS. 
Despite the range of surgical interventions available, and currently applied in practice for the management of INS, there is no clear consensus, and no accepted clinical guidelines regarding the relative efficacy and safety of the various treatment options. A better understanding of these surgical options, along with their associated side effects, will assist clinicians in evidence‐based decision‐making in relation to the management of INS. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of surgical interventions for INS.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, ISRCTN registry, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) to 3 July 2020, with no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) studying the efficacy and safety of surgical options for treating INS. 
Data collection and analysis
Our prespecified outcome measures were the change from baseline in: binocular best‐corrected distance visual acuity; head posture; amplitude, frequency, intensity, and foveation period durations of the nystagmus waveform; visual recognition times; quality of life and self‐reported outcome measures; incidence of adverse effects with a probable causal link to treatment; and permanent adverse effects after surgery. 
Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and full‐text articles, extracted data from eligible RCTs, and judged the risk of bias using the Cochrane tool. We reached consensus on any disagreements by discussion. We summarised the overall certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We only identified one eligible RCT (N = 10 participants), undertaken in India. This trial randomised participants to receive either a large retro‐equatorial recession of the horizontal rectus muscle of 9 mm on the medial rectus and 12 mm on the lateral rectus, or a simple tenotomy and resuturing of the four horizontal rectus muscles. We did not identify any RCTs comparing a surgical intervention for INS relative to no treatment. 
In the single eligible RCT, both eyes of each participant received the same intervention. The participants’ age and gender were not reported, nor was information on whether participants were idiopathic or had sensory disorders. The study only included participants with null in primary position and did not explicitly exclude those with congenital periodic alternating nystagmus. The study did not report funding source(s) or author declaration of interests. The evaluation period was six months. 
We judged this study at low risk for sequence generation and other sources of bias, but at high risk of bias for performance and detection bias. The risk of bias was unclear for selection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias. 
There is very uncertain evidence about the effect of the interventions on visual acuity and change in amplitude, frequency, and intensity of the nystagmus waveform. We were unable to calculate relative effects due to lack of data. None of the participants in either intervention group reported adverse effects at six‐month follow‐up (very low‐certainty evidence). There was no quantitative data reported for quality of life, although the study reported an improvement in quality of life after surgery in both intervention groups (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Change in head posture, foveation period durations of the nystagmus waveform, visual recognition times, and permanent adverse effects after surgery were not reported in the included study. 
We judged the certainty of the evidence, for both the primary and secondary efficacy outcomes, to be very low. Due to a lack of comprehensive reporting of adverse events, there was also very low‐certainty of the safety profile of the evaluated surgical interventions in this population. As such, we are very uncertain about the relative efficacy and safety of these interventions for the surgical management of INS. 
Authors' conclusions
This systematic review identified minimal high‐quality evidence relating to the efficacy and safety of surgical interventions for INS. The limited availability of evidence must be considered by clinicians when treating INS, particularly given these procedures are irreversible and often performed on children. More high‐quality RCTs are needed to better understand the efficacy and safety profile of surgical interventions for INS. This will assist clinicians, people with INS, and their parents or caregivers to make evidence‐based treatment decisions.

A Review of Eye Surgery for Wobbly Eyes (Infantile Nystagmus Syndrome)

### **Rationale**

Some babies and children have a condition called Infantile Nystagmus Syndrome, or INS. This condition makes their eyes move quickly and without their control. This can be called ""wobbly eyes."" These eye movements can make it hard for a person to see clearly.

There is no cure for INS. But some treatments can help. One type of treatment is surgery on the eye muscles. Doctors use different kinds of surgery to help with INS. But we do not have clear rules on which surgery works best or is the safest.

Researchers did this study to learn more about these surgeries. They wanted to look at all the past research. They hoped to find out which surgery helps people the most. This information can help doctors, patients, and families make better decisions about treatment.

### **Trial Design**

This was a review study. This means the researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they looked for studies that were already done. They searched for a special kind of study called a randomized controlled trial. In these trials, people are put into groups by chance to compare different treatments. This is the best way to see if a treatment really works.

The researchers looked for trials that compared different surgeries for INS. After a wide search, they only found one such trial. This one trial was done in India. It included 10 people who had INS. The study did not report their age or gender.

In that one study, the 10 people were split into two groups. Each group got a different type of surgery on their eye muscles. Doctors checked on the people in the study for 6 months to see how the surgery worked.

### **Results**

The main result of this review is that there is very little good information on surgery for INS. The one study that the researchers found did not give clear answers.

The researchers who did the review were not sure they could trust the results of that one study.
*   **Vision:** They could not tell if one surgery was better than the other at helping people see more clearly.
*   **Eye Movement:** They also could not tell if one surgery did a better job of calming the wobbly eye movements.
*   **Side Effects:** The study said that no one had bad side effects from the surgery. But the review authors felt the proof for this was very weak.
*   **Quality of Life:** The study said that people’s lives got better after the surgery. But it did not give any real data or numbers to prove this.

The authors of the review concluded that there is not enough good proof to know how well these surgeries work. They are also unsure about how safe the surgeries are. This is very important because these surgeries cannot be undone. They are also often done on young children.

More high-quality studies are needed. Better studies will help doctors, people with INS, and their families. They can then use good facts to make the best treatment choices.","What are the benefits and risks of different surgical procedures for infantile nystagmus syndrome (an eye disorder that develops shortly after birth)? 
Why is this question important?Infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS) is an eye disorder that causes involuntary movement of the eyes from side to side, up and down, or in circles. INS typically develops shortly after birth, and persists throughout life. It is often associated with visual problems, such as:‐ long‐sightedness (when people can see distant objects clearly, but near objects appear blurred);‐ or short‐sightedness (when people can see near objects clearly, but distant objects appear blurred). 
There is currently no cure for INS. However, it is possible to reduce eye movement and improve people’s vision. One of the main options is eye surgery, which involves operating on the muscles that control eye movement. Several different surgical procedures can be used: some procedures involve detaching and reattaching the eye muscles, whereas others require complete removal of these muscles.   
It is unclear whether some surgical procedures for INS have more benefits or risks than others. To find out which surgical procedures work best, we reviewed the evidence from research studies. We were particularly interested in whether different surgical procedures could improve vision and quality of life in people with INS. We also wanted to know about any adverse (unwanted) effects. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?First, we searched for randomised controlled studies, in which people were randomly divided into two or more treatment groups. This makes it less likely that any differences between treatment effects were actually due to differences in the people who received them (rather than due to the treatments themselves, which is what we wanted to find out). 
We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. 
What did we find?We found one study, set in India, that involved a total of 10 people with INS who were followed for six months after surgery. The study authors did not report any information about: ‐ the age and gender of the people who took part in it;‐ or the source of funding for the study. 
The study compared two different surgical procedures: ‐ one procedure in which two horizontal rectus muscles (eye muscles that control side‐to‐side eye movements) were moved from their original position to a position further back on the eyeball; and‐ another procedure in which four horizontal rectus muscles were detached and reattached, in their original position.The procedures were conducted in both eyes. 
The study compared the effects of the treatments on:‐ clarity of vision six months after surgery;‐ intensity of eye movement six months after surgery;‐ adverse events six months after surgery; and‐ quality of life.   
The study did not investigate the effects of treatments on:‐ head posture;‐ the amount of time when the eye is still; or‐ the time it takes to recognise objects. 
We have very little confidence in the evidence from the study we found, because:‐ it is based on a very small number of people; and‐ the patients and researchers in the study knew which type of surgery each patient received. This knowledge may have influenced the study results. 
We therefore cannot determine whether the two procedures investigated in the study had different benefits and risks. 
What does this mean?There is insufficient evidence to determine whether some surgical procedures are better than others for INS. We need researchers to conduct robust randomised controlled trials in future, so that we can compare different procedures. This would help clinicians, and people with INS, to make treatment decisions based on evidence from research. 
How‐up‐to date is this review?The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to July 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD009134.pub2,"Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for acute respiratory failure following upper abdominal surgery 
Review question 
The goal of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) (continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel NPPV) compared with oxygen therapy alone in adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. 
Background 
Acute respiratory failure , where fluid builds up in the lungs stopping oxygen from crossing into the blood, is a relatively common complication after abdominal surgery and can increase the risk of dying (mortality). 
NPPV is a type of treatment that helps to improve breathing without having to insert a tube inside a person's windpipe (tracheal intubation). This intervention is effective in several illnesses. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases for clinical trials looking at the treatment of adults with acute respiratory failure following abdominal surgery. The trials compared NPPV with usual care(oxygen therapy through a face mask). We included two trials involving 269 participants.The participants were mostly men (67%) and on average 65 years of age. One trial was conducted in several intensive care units (ICU). Both trials included adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. The evidence is current to May 2015. 
Key results 
This review examined mortality, rate of tracheal intubation, length of stay in the ICU, length of hospital stay, complications after NPPV, and changes in the levels of gases within the blood (arterial blood gases). 
Compared with oxygen therapy, NPPV decreased the rate of tracheal intubation. Out of every 1000 adults who developed acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery, 181 adults treated with oxygen therapy would need to be intubated compared with 54 adults treated with NPPV. 
When compared to oxygen therapy, NPPV tended to reduce mortality. However, since the number of participants included in the two trials was small, more studies are needed. 
The use of NPPV also reduced the length of stay in the ICU by almost two days when compared to oxygen therapy. However, the mean length of stay in the hospital was similar in the two groups. 
When compared to oxygen therapy, NPPV improved blood gas levels one hour after the intervention. 
There was insufficient evidence to be certain that CPAP or NPPV had an effect on anastomotic (e.g. where two pieces of intestine are joined together) leakage, pneumonia related complications and sepsis (blood poisoning) or infections. However, adults treated with NPPV had lower rates these complications than adults treated with oxygen. 
Quality of the evidence 
There was low quality evidence for hospital mortality, low quality of evidence for rate of tracheal intubation, and very low quality of evidence for ICU length of stay. 
Authors' conclusions 
The findings of this review showed that NPPV is an effective and safe treatment for adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. However, due to the low quality of the evidence, more good quality studies are needed to confirm these findings.

A Study on Using a Special Breathing Mask to Help Patients After Belly Surgery

### **Rationale**

Sometimes after a big surgery on the upper belly, people can have trouble breathing. Their lungs can fill with fluid. This makes it hard for their bodies to get enough oxygen. This is a serious problem called acute respiratory failure.

Doctors often treat this by giving patients oxygen through a simple face mask. This study looked at a different kind of breathing support. It is a special mask that fits snugly over the nose or mouth. The mask gently pushes air into the lungs. This helps keep the small air sacs in the lungs open. This can make it easier for a person to breathe.

The researchers in this study wanted to find out if this special mask works better than a simple oxygen mask. They also wanted to know if it was safe for people who just had surgery.

### **Trial Design**

The researchers did not run a new study with patients. Instead, they carefully looked at the results from two past studies. These studies looked at how to best help people with breathing problems after surgery.

The two studies included a total of 269 adults. They all had breathing problems after surgery on their upper belly. About 2 out of every 3 patients were men. The average age of the patients was 65 years old.

In the studies, patients were split into two groups. One group got help from the special breathing mask. The other group got the usual care, which was oxygen from a regular face mask. The studies took place in the intensive care unit, or ICU. The ICU is a special part of the hospital that cares for very sick people.

### **Results**

The study found that the special breathing mask helped patients in several ways.

Fewer people who used the special mask needed a breathing tube put down their throat. For every 100 people who used a regular oxygen mask, about 18 needed a breathing tube. But for every 100 people who used the special mask, only about 5 needed one.

The special mask also seemed to lower the risk of dying. However, the studies were small, so the researchers could not be completely sure. More studies are needed to confirm this.

People who used the special mask also spent less time in the ICU. They were able to leave the ICU almost two days sooner than those who used a regular oxygen mask. But, the total time spent in the hospital was about the same for both groups of patients.

The special mask also improved the oxygen levels in the blood very quickly. This happened within one hour of using the mask. Researchers also looked to see if the mask helped lower the risk of other problems, like infections. It seemed that patients who used the special mask had fewer of these problems, but more research is needed to be certain.

The researchers who wrote the report believe the special mask is an effective and safe treatment. It can help adults with breathing problems after upper belly surgery. But, they also said that the proof from these two studies was not very strong. More good studies are needed to confirm that this is the best way to help patients.","Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for acute respiratory failure following upper abdominal surgery

The prevalence of substance use, both prescribed and non‐prescribed, is increasing in many areas of the world. Substance use by women of childbearing age contributes to increasing rates of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is a newer term describing the subset of NAS related to opioid exposure. Non‐pharmacological care is the first‐line treatment for substance withdrawal in newborns. Despite the widespread use of non‐pharmacological care to mitigate symptoms of NAS, there is not an established definition of, and standard for, non‐pharmacological care practices in this population. Evaluation of safety and efficacy of non‐pharmacological practices could provide clear guidance for clinical practice.

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of non‐pharmacological treatment of infants at risk for, or having symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal on the length of hospitalization and use of pharmacological treatment for symptom management. 
Comparison 1: in infants at risk for, or having early symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal, does non‐pharmacological treatment reduce the length of hospitalization and use of pharmacological treatment? 
Comparison 2: in infants receiving pharmacological treatment for symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal, does concurrent non‐pharmacological treatment reduce duration of pharmacological treatment, maximum and cumulative doses of opioid medication, and length of hospitalization? 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search CENTRAL (2019, Issue 10); Ovid MEDLINE; and CINAHL on 11 October 2019. We also searched clinical trials databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, and cluster trials. 
Selection criteria
We included trials comparing single or bundled non‐pharmacological interventions to no non‐pharmacological treatment or different single or bundled non‐pharmacological interventions. We assessed non‐pharmacological interventions independently and in combination based on sufficient similarity in population, intervention, and comparison groups studied. We categorized non‐pharmacological interventions as: modifying environmental stimulation, feeding practices, and support of the mother‐infant dyad. We presented non‐randomized studies identified in the search process narratively. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Primary outcomes in infants at risk for, or having early symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal included length of hospitalization and pharmacological treatment with one or more doses of opioid or sedative medication. Primary outcomes in infants receiving opioid treatment for symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal included length of hospitalization, length of pharmacological treatment with opioid or sedative medication, and maximum and cumulative doses of opioid medication. 
Main results
We identified six RCTs (353 infants) in which infants at risk for, or having symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal participated between 1975 and 2018. We identified no RCTs in which infants receiving opioid treatment for symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal participated. The certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low to low. We also identified and excluded 34 non‐randomized studies published between 2005 and 2018, including 29 in which infants at risk for, or having symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal participated and five in which infants receiving opioid treatment for symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal participated. We identified seven preregistered interventional clinical trials that may qualify for inclusion at review update when complete. 
Of the six RCTs, four studies assessed modifying environmental stimulation in the form of a mechanical rocking bed, prone positioning, non‐oscillating waterbed, or a low‐stimulation nursery; one study assessed feeding practices (comparing 24 kcal/oz to 20 kcal/oz formula); and one study assessed support of the maternal‐infant dyad (tailored breastfeeding support). 
There was no evidence of a difference in length of hospitalization in the one study that assessed modifying environmental stimulation (mean difference [MD) –1 day, 95% confidence interval [CI) –2.82 to 0.82; 30 infants; very low‐certainty evidence) and the one study of support of the maternal‐infant dyad (MD –8.9 days, 95% CI –19.84 to 2.04; 14 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). No studies of feeding practices evaluated the length of hospitalization. 
There was no evidence of a difference in use of pharmacological treatment in three studies of modifying environmental stimulation (typical risk ratio [RR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.16; 92 infants; low‐certainty evidence), one study of feeding practices (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.33; 49 infants; very low‐certainty evidence), and one study of support of the maternal‐infant dyad (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.90; 14 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Reported secondary outcomes included neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, days to regain birth weight, and weight nadir. One study of support of the maternal‐infant dyad reported NICU admission (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.90; 14 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). One study of feeding practices reported days to regain birth weight (MD 1.10 days, 95% CI 2.76 to 0.56; 46 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). One study that assessed modifying environmental stimulation reported weight nadir (MD –0.28, 95% CI –1.15 to 0.59; 194 infants; very low‐certainty evidence) and one study of feeding practices reported weight nadir (MD –0.8, 95% CI –2.24 to 0.64; 46 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
We are uncertain whether non‐pharmacological care for opioid withdrawal in newborns affects important clinical outcomes including length of hospitalization and use of pharmacological treatment based on the six included studies. The outcomes identified for this review were of very low‐ to low‐certainty evidence. Combined analysis was limited by heterogeneity in study design and intervention definitions as well as the number of studies. Many prespecified outcomes were not reported. Although caregivers are encouraged by experts to optimize non‐pharmacological care for opioid withdrawal in newborns prior to initiating pharmacological care, we do not have sufficient evidence to inform specific clinical practices. Larger well‐designed studies are needed to determine the effect of non‐pharmacological care for opioid withdrawal in newborns.

Does Care Without Medicine Help Babies with Opioid Withdrawal? A Review of the Research

### **Rationale**

Some mothers need to take opioid medicines while they are pregnant. These can be pain medicines prescribed by a doctor. When a baby is born, they are no longer getting the medicine from their mother. This can cause the baby to go through withdrawal.

This condition is called neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, or NOWS. A baby with NOWS may cry more than usual. They may have trouble feeding and sleeping. This can be a very hard start to life for a newborn.

Doctors and nurses use many ways to comfort these babies. They often try care without medicine first. This is called non-drug care. It can include things like:
*   Swaddling the baby tightly in a blanket.
*   Keeping the lights low and the room quiet.
*   Giving the baby a special type of formula.
*   Helping the mother and baby stay close together.

The problem is that there are no set rules for which type of non-drug care is best. Doctors need to know what works. This study was done to look at all the past research on this topic. The researchers wanted to see if non-drug care helps babies get better faster. They also wanted to see if it reduces the need for withdrawal medicine.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, the researchers did a review of studies that were already completed. A review gathers all the best research on one topic. It helps us see what we have learned so far.

The research team searched for studies from all over the world. They looked for a specific type of study called a randomized controlled trial. These studies provide the most reliable proof. The team looked for studies about newborn babies who were at risk for, or who had, opioid withdrawal.

In the studies, one group of babies received a type of non-drug care. Another group of babies received a different type of care or just the usual hospital care. The studies then compared how the babies in each group did. Because this was a review of many past studies, there was no set amount of time a person was involved.

### **Results**

The researchers found six good-quality studies to include in their review. These studies looked at a total of 353 babies. The studies were done between the years 1975 and 2018.

The proof from these six studies was rated as ""very low to low certainty."" This means we cannot be very sure about the results. The studies were small and were designed in different ways, which makes it hard to combine their findings.

The studies tested different types of non-drug care. These included changing the baby's surroundings, changing their feeding plan, and giving the mother extra support with breastfeeding. Here is what the researchers found:
*   **Time in the hospital:** The review did not find clear proof that non-drug care helped babies leave the hospital sooner.
*   **Need for medicine:** The review also found no clear proof that non-drug care reduced the number of babies who needed medicine for their withdrawal symptoms.

The main conclusion from the researchers is that we are still not sure if non-drug care helps babies with opioid withdrawal. The studies that have been done so far are not strong enough to guide doctors.

Even though experts encourage non-drug care, we do not have enough evidence to say which specific types of care work best. We need bigger and better-designed studies in the future. These studies will help us find the best ways to care for these small and vulnerable babies.","Non‐pharmacological care for opioid withdrawal in newborns
Review question 
Do one or more specific non‐pharmacological (treatments other than medicines) care practices benefit newborns with opioid withdrawal after birth? 
Background 
Newborns of mothers who take opioids during pregnancy often experience symptoms of withdrawal after delivery, such as high‐pitched cry, tremors, and high tone. Non‐pharmacological care is the first treatment for symptoms of withdrawal. If symptoms worsen despite non‐pharmacological care, a medication such as morphine, methadone, or buprenorphine is the second treatment to reduce symptoms. Though non‐pharmacological care is the first approach to symptom management, it is not the same at every hospital. We wanted to discover whether one or more non‐pharmacological care practices benefit newborns with opioid withdrawal after birth. 
Study characteristics 
We looked at randomized controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) of opioid‐exposed newborns treated with one or more non‐pharmacological care practice. Non‐pharmacological care practices include changes to the environment to reduce stimulation or provide soothing, changes to feeding frequency or type, changes that increase maternal care of the newborn or maternal wellness, and multiple changes such as occur in a new site or system of care. Search is up to date as of October 2019. 
Key results 
This review included six RCTs that enrolled 353 opioid‐exposed newborns. The studies were published between 1975 and 2018. We also identified seven ongoing studies that may qualify for inclusion at review update when complete. 
Of the six RCTs, four assessed changes to the environment to reduce stimulation or provide soothing. These studies examined the effect of a mechanical rocking bed, prone positioning (lying on tummy), non‐oscillating waterbed, and a low‐stimulation nursery. We are uncertain whether modifying environmental stimulation is associated with length of hospitalization based on one study with 30 infants. Modifying environmental stimulation may be associated with little or no difference in use of pharmacological treatment based on three studies with 92 infants. We are uncertain whether modifying environmental stimulation is associated with weight nadir (lowest weight recorded during birth hospitalization) based on one study with 194 infants. 
One study assessed a change to the feeding type comparing higher‐calorie formula to standard‐calorie formula. We are uncertain whether feeding practices are associated with use of medicines, days to regain birth weight, or weight nadir based on one study with 46 infants. 
One study assessed changes to support the mother with tailored breastfeeding support. We are uncertain whether support of the mother‐infant dyad is associated with length of hospitalization, use of medicines, or neonatal intensive care unit admission based on one study with 14 infants. 
Many potential important effects were not reported, and others were not reported in all studies. 
Quality of evidence 
We are uncertain whether one or more specific non‐pharmacological care practices benefit newborns with opioid withdrawal after birth. The quality of evidence for all outcomes is very low to low and provides limited information to inform individual non‐pharmacological care practices or combinations of non‐pharmacological care practices.

10.1002-14651858.CD013757.pub2,"Background
Respiratory viruses are the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and hospitalisation in infants and young children. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the main infectious agent in this population. Palivizumab is administered intramuscularly every month during five months in the first RSV season to prevent serious RSV LRTI in children. Given its high cost, it is essential to know if palivizumab continues to be effective in preventing severe RSV disease in children. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of palivizumab for preventing severe RSV infection in children.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, three other databases and two trials registers to 14 October 2021, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We searched Embase to October 2020, as we did not have access to this database for 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster‐RCTs, comparing palivizumab given at a dose of 15 mg/kg once a month (maximum five doses) with placebo, no intervention or standard care in children 0 to 24 months of age from both genders, regardless of RSV infection history.  
Data collection and analysis
We used Cochrane’s Screen4Me workflow to help assess the search results. Two review authors screened studies for selection, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We used standard Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. The primary outcomes were hospitalisation due to RSV infection, all‐cause mortality and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were hospitalisation due to respiratory‐related illness, length of hospital stay, RSV infection, number of wheezing days, days of supplemental oxygen, intensive care unit length of stay and mechanical ventilation days. 
Main results
We included five studies with  a total of 3343 participants. All studies were parallel RCTs, assessing the effects of 15 mg/kg of palivizumab every month up to five months compared to placebo or no intervention in an outpatient setting, although one study also included hospitalised infants. Most of the included studies were conducted in children with a high risk of RSV infection due to comorbidities like bronchopulmonary dysplasia and congenital heart disease. The risk of bias of outcomes across all studies was similar and predominately low.  
Palivizumab reduces hospitalisation due to RSV infection at two years' follow‐up (risk ratio (RR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 0.64; 5 studies, 3343 participants; high certainty evidence). Based on 98 hospitalisations per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 43 (29 to 62) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in little to no difference in mortality at two years' follow‐up (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.15; 5 studies, 3343 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Based on 23 deaths per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 16 (10 to 27) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in little to no difference in adverse events at 150 days' follow‐up (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.39; 3 studies, 2831 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Based on 84 cases per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 91 (71 to 117) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in a slight reduction in hospitalisation due to respiratory‐related illness at two years' follow‐up (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.97; 5 studies, 3343 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Palivizumab may result in a large reduction in RSV infection at two years' follow‐up (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.55; 3 studies, 554 participants; low certainty evidence). Based on 195 cases of RSV infection per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 64 (39 to 107) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab also reduces the number of wheezing days at one year's follow‐up (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.44; 1 study, 429 participants; high certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
The available evidence suggests that prophylaxis with palivizumab reduces hospitalisation due to RSV infection and results in little to no difference in mortality or adverse events. Moreover, palivizumab results in a slight reduction in hospitalisation due to respiratory‐related illness and may result in a large reduction in RSV infections. Palivizumab also reduces the number of wheezing days. These results may be applicable to children with a high risk of RSV infection due to comorbidities. 
Further research is needed to establish the effect of palivizumab on children with other comorbidities known as risk factors for severe RSV disease (e.g. immune deficiencies) and other social determinants of the disease, including children living in low‐ and middle‐income countries, tropical regions, children lacking breastfeeding, living in poverty, or members of families in overcrowded situations.  
","Here is the Plain Language Summary of the biomedical study:

### **Plain Title**

Does a Medicine Help Stop a Serious Breathing Sickness in Young Children?

### **Rationale**

**What is RSV?**
RSV, which stands for respiratory syncytial virus, is a common germ. For most people, it feels like a bad cold. But for babies and young children, RSV can be very serious. It can harm their lungs and make it hard to breathe. This can lead to a serious sickness. Many young children with this sickness need to go to the hospital.

**What medicine was studied?**
There is a medicine called palivizumab. It is given as a shot. This medicine helps a child’s body get ready to fight the RSV virus. It is for children who have a high chance of getting very sick from RSV. They get one shot each month for five months. This is done during the winter when RSV is most common.

**Why was this study needed?**
The medicine palivizumab costs a lot of money. Researchers wanted to be sure that it still works well to protect children. They decided to look at the results from many past studies. This helps them get a clear answer about how well the medicine works.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**
This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at five older studies that were already finished. They combined all the information from these studies to see the big picture. This kind of study is called a review.

**Who was in the studies?**
The five studies included more than 3,300 children in total. The children were all very young, from birth up to 2 years old. There were both boys and girls in the studies. Most of these children had a high chance of getting very sick from RSV. This was because they already had other health problems with their heart or lungs.

**What happened in the studies?**
In each study, children were put into two groups. One group got the real medicine, palivizumab. The other group got a placebo. A placebo is a shot that looks like the real medicine but has no medicine in it. Using a placebo helps researchers see if the real medicine truly made a difference. Children were in the studies for about two years.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**
The review showed that the medicine helped children a lot. It helped keep them from getting very sick and needing to go to the hospital.
*   Out of 1,000 children who got the placebo shot, 98 went to the hospital because of RSV.
*   Out of 1,000 children who got the real medicine, only 43 went to the hospital for RSV.

**Did the medicine help in other ways?**
Yes. Children who got the medicine had fewer visits to the hospital for any kind of breathing problem. They also had fewer days with wheezing. Wheezing is a whistling sound when a person has trouble breathing. The medicine may also have stopped many children from getting the RSV virus in the first place.

**Did the medicine cause any problems?**
The researchers looked very closely at side effects. They found that there was little to no difference in side effects between the groups. The number of deaths was also about the same for children who got the medicine and those who did not. This means the medicine seems to be safe.

**What did the researchers conclude?**
The researchers concluded that palivizumab works. It helps protect young children who are at high risk for serious RSV sickness. The medicine lowers their chance of needing to go to the hospital. The researchers suggest that this medicine should be used for children who have a high chance of getting very sick from RSV.","Palivizumab for respiratory syncytial virus infection prevention in children
Review question 
What are the effects (benefits and harms) of palivizumab for preventing severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children? 
Background 
RSV is the main cause of acute respiratory infections in children, mainly during the first year of life, accounting for 33.1 million infections a year with an estimated 90.6% of these episodes occurring in low‐ and middle‐income countries. These infections may present with a runny nose, fever, cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, or difficulty feeding. They may result in hospitalisation, admission to an intensive care unit, and even death, in particular amongst infants aged less than two months, with an estimated hospitalisation rate of 1970 per 100,000 population and 59,600 deaths annually worldwide in children younger than five years old. They may also lead to long‐term complications such as recurrent wheezing and chronic lung problems.  
Palivizumab, sold under the brand name Synagis, is a drug administered with an intramuscular injection every month up to five doses to prevent serious infections in children at high risk for severe disease. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to 14 October 2021.
Study characteristics 
We included five studies with 3343 participants. All studies included a small number of participants, including children with a high risk of adverse outcomes if infected with RSV due to underlying health issues, such as premature birth or heart or pulmonary problems.    
Study funding sources 
Most studies did not specify their funding sources. One study was funded by Abbott Laboratories and by the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development.  
Key results 
Palivizumab reduces hospitalisation due to RSV infection by 56%; based on 98 cases per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 43 per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in little to no difference in mortality, and little to no difference in adverse events; based on 23 deaths per 1000 participants and 84 adverse events per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 16 deaths per 1000 participants and 81  adverse events per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in a slight reduction in hospitalisation due to respiratory illness by 22% but may result in little to no difference in length of hospital stay. It may reduce RSV infection rate by 67% at two years’ follow‐up. Palivizumab also reduces the number of wheezing days by 61% but may result in little to no difference in days using oxygen, length of stay in the intensive care unit, or mechanical ventilation days.  
Certainty of the evidence 
The overall certainty of the evidence was moderate to high.

Review question 
Are the glucose‐lowering medicines, DPP‐4 inhibitors (e.g. linagliptin or vildagliptin) and GLP‐1 analogues (e.g. exenatide or liraglutide) able to prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes and its associated complications in people at risk for the development of type 2 diabetes? 
Background 
DPP‐4 inhibitors and GLP‐1 analogues are widely used to treat people with type 2 diabetes. People with moderately elevated blood glucose are said to be at an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes (often referred to as 'prediabetes'). It is currently not known whether DPP‐4 inhibitors or GLP‐1 analogues should be prescribed for people with raised blood glucose levels who do not have type 2 diabetes. We wanted to find out whether these medicines could prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people at increased risk. We also wanted to know the effects on patient‐important outcomes such as complications of diabetes (e.g. kidney and eye disease, heart attacks, strokes), death from any cause, health‐related quality of life (a measure of a person's satisfaction with their life and health) and side effects of the medicines. 
Study characteristics 
Participants had to have blood glucose levels higher than considered normal, but below the glucose levels that are used to diagnose type 2 diabetes mellitus. We found seven randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 2702 participants. The duration of the treatments varied from 12 weeks to 160 weeks. One study investigating liraglutide dominated the evidence (2285/2702 participants). The participants in this study were overweight or obese. 
This evidence is up to date as of January 2017.
Key results 
DPP‐4 inhibitors did not reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with placebo (a dummy medicine). In the big study investigating the GLP‐1‐analogue liraglutide, given in a dose used for obese people (3.0 mg), the development of type 2 diabetes was delayed: 26/1472 (1.8%) participants randomised to liraglutide compared with 46/738 (6.2%) participants randomised to placebo developed type 2 diabetes after 160 weeks. On the other side, 970/1472 (66%) participants randomised to liraglutide compared with 268/738 (36%) participants randomised to placebo switched back to normal glucose levels. This study was extended for another 12 weeks without treatment and five additional participants developed diabetes in the liraglutide group, compared with one participant in the placebo group. After the 12 weeks without treatment, 740/1472 (50%) participants in the liraglutide group compared with 263/738 (36%) participants in the placebo group had glucose levels considered as normal. This means that to keep chances high to prevent type 2 diabetes in people at risk one probably needs to continuously take this drug. Of note, serious adverse events (e.g. defined as hospitalisation or a hazard putting the participant at risk, such as an interaction with another medicine) happened more often following liraglutide treatment (230/1524 (15%) participants in the liraglutide group and 96/755 (13%) participants in the placebo group) and it is unclear whether taking this drug is safe in the long term. 
We detected neither an advantage nor a disadvantage of DPP‐4 inhibitors or GLP‐1 analogues in relation to non‐fatal heart attacks, non‐fatal strokes or heart failure. Our included studies did not report on other complications of diabetes such as kidney or eye disease. The effects on health‐related quality of life were inconclusive. In the included studies, very few participants died and there was no apparent relation to treatment. 
Future studies should investigate more patient‐important outcomes like complications of diabetes and especially the side effects of the medications, because we do not know for sure whether 'prediabetes' is just a condition arbitrarily defined by a laboratory measurement, is in fact a real risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus and whether treatment of this condition translates into better patient‐important outcomes. 
Quality of the evidence 
All included trials had deficiencies in the way they were conducted or how key items were reported. For the individual comparisons, the number of participants was small, resulting in a high risk of random errors (play of chance).

### **Plain Title**

Can Medicines for Type 2 Diabetes Also Prevent It?

### **Rationale**

Some people have blood sugar that is high, but not high enough to be called type 2 diabetes. This is sometimes called ‘prediabetes’. People with this condition have a higher chance of getting type 2 diabetes in the future.

There are medicines that help lower blood sugar in people who already have type 2 diabetes. This study looked at two types of these drugs. One type is called DPP-4 inhibitors. The other is called GLP-1 analogues.

Doctors wanted to know if these drugs could also help people with prediabetes. This study tried to find out if taking these drugs could stop or delay type 2 diabetes. The study also looked at side effects and other health problems, like heart attacks or strokes.

### **Trial Design**

This summary is based on a review of seven different studies. In these studies, people were put into groups by chance. This is a common way to do research.

Some people in the studies got a real drug. Other people got a dummy pill, called a placebo. A placebo has no medicine in it. This helps researchers see if the real drug is working.

A total of 2,702 people took part in these studies. All of them had blood sugar levels that were higher than normal. One study was much larger than the others. Most of the people in that large study were overweight or had obesity. People were in the studies for different lengths of time, from about 3 months to about 3 years.

### **Results**

The two types of drugs had different results. One type of drug, the DPP-4 inhibitors, did not seem to work. Taking these drugs did not lower the risk of getting type 2 diabetes compared to the dummy pill.

The other type of drug, a GLP-1 analogue called liraglutide, did show an effect. In the largest study, this drug helped delay type 2 diabetes. After about 3 years, fewer people taking liraglutide got diabetes. About 2 in 100 people on the drug got diabetes. In the group taking the dummy pill, about 6 in 100 people got diabetes.

The liraglutide drug also helped more people get their blood sugar back to a normal level. However, this benefit seemed to go away if people stopped taking the drug. This may mean that a person needs to take the drug all the time to keep the benefit.

There were some concerns about side effects. More people who took liraglutide had serious health problems than those who took the dummy pill. About 15 in 100 people taking the drug had a serious problem. For those taking the dummy pill, about 13 in 100 had a serious problem. Because of this, we do not know if this drug is safe to take for a long time.

The drugs did not seem to change the risk of having a heart attack or stroke. The studies did not look at other problems from diabetes, like eye or kidney disease. The researchers concluded that liraglutide might help delay type 2 diabetes. But it may also cause serious side effects. More research is needed to know if treating prediabetes is worth the risks of the medicine.","Dipeptidyl‐peptidase (DPP)‐4 inhibitors and glucagon‐like peptide (GLP)‐1 analogues for prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes mellitus

On the other side, 970/1472 (66%) participants randomised to liraglutide compared with 268/738 (36%) participants randomised to placebo switched back to normal glucose levels. This study was extended for another 12 weeks without treatment and five additional participants developed diabetes in the liraglutide group, compared with one participant in the placebo group. After the 12 weeks without treatment, 740/1472 (50%) participants in the liraglutide group compared with 263/738 (36%) participants in the placebo group had glucose levels considered as normal. This means that to keep chances high to prevent type 2 diabetes in people at risk one probably needs to continuously take this drug. Of note, serious adverse events (e.g. defined as hospitalisation or a hazard putting the participant at risk, such as an interaction with another medicine) happened more often following liraglutide treatment (230/1524 (15%) participants in the liraglutide group and 96/755 (13%) participants in the placebo group) and it is unclear whether taking this drug is safe in the long term. 
We detected neither an advantage nor a disadvantage of DPP‐4 inhibitors or GLP‐1 analogues in relation to non‐fatal heart attacks, non‐fatal strokes or heart failure. Our included studies did not report on other complications of diabetes such as kidney or eye disease. The effects on health‐related quality of life were inconclusive. In the included studies, very few participants died and there was no apparent relation to treatment. 
Future studies should investigate more patient‐important outcomes like complications of diabetes and especially the side effects of the medications, because we do not know for sure whether 'prediabetes' is just a condition arbitrarily defined by a laboratory measurement, is in fact a real risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus and whether treatment of this condition translates into better patient‐important outcomes. 
Quality of the evidence 
All included trials had deficiencies in the way they were conducted or how key items were reported. For the individual comparisons, the number of participants was small, resulting in a high risk of random errors (play of chance).

We asked 
Is there a difference in the rate of parastomal herniation, and other stoma‐related complications in people undergoing abdominal wall enterostomy, when comparing two stoma formation techniques: lateral pararectal, in which the stoma is located beside the rectus abdominis muscle, one of the muscles of the abdominal wall, versus transrectal, in which the stoma is pulled through the rectus abdominis muscle? 
Background 
A stoma is an opening in the abdomen, which is surgically created to divert the flow of urine or feces; an enterostomy is a stoma that starts in the bowel. A parastomal hernia is an incisional hernia, through which abdominal contents protrude through a defect in the abdominal wall at the site of previous surgery. It is related to a stoma, and is one of the most common stoma‐related complications. Many factors that potentially influence the occurrence of parastomal herniation have been investigated. However, it remains unclear whether the enterostomy should be placed through or beside the rectus abdominis muscle in order to prevent parastomal herniation. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to 9 November 2018. In this update, we included 10 retrospective cohort studies with a total of 864 participants, and one randomized controlled trial (RCT: a study in which participants are randomly allocated to the treatment groups), including 60 participants. The target population was individuals, regardless of age, who received a temporary or permanent enterostomy for any reason in either the elective (planned) or the emergency setting. 
Key results 
The results found inconclusive results between the two techniques for the risk of parastomal herniation (11 studies, 924 participants), stomal prolapse (1 study, 145 participants), ileus or stenosis (1 study, 60 participants), and skin irritation (1 study, 60 participants). 
Neither technique was found to be better than the other for any of the stoma‐related outcomes of interest. 
None of the studies measured other stoma‐related problems, or death.
Quality of the evidence 
We downgraded the quality of the evidence to moderate, low, or very low, because of high risk of bias, small sample sizes, few events, and diversity across studies. 
Conclusion 
Based on the current knowledge presented in this review, there is no evidence to support the use of one stoma formation technique over the other. Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect.

Comparing Two Ways to Create a Stoma to See Which Prevents a Bulge

### **Rationale**

**What is a stoma and why is it needed?**

Sometimes, a person’s bowel or bladder does not work as it should. This can be due to an illness or injury. Doctors may need to do a surgery to create a new way for waste (poop or pee) to leave the body.

During this surgery, doctors make a small opening on the outside of the belly. This opening is called a stoma. A bag is worn over the stoma to collect the waste. This helps the person live a more normal life.

**A common problem after stoma surgery**

A common problem for people with a stoma is a bulge near the opening. This bulge is called a parastomal hernia (her-nee-uh). A hernia happens when parts from inside the belly, like the intestine, push through a weak spot in the belly muscle. This creates a lump under the skin. A hernia can be uncomfortable and may cause other health issues.

**Why was this study done?**

Doctors want to prevent hernias from happening. They think the way they create the stoma might make a difference. There are two main ways to do the surgery. One way is to make the stoma go *through* a main belly muscle. The other way is to make it go *beside* that muscle.

Doctors did not know if one way was better than the other at stopping hernias. This study was done to compare the two surgery methods. The goal was to find out if one method was safer or worked better to prevent hernias and other problems.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This study was a review. This means the researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they gathered and studied the results of past research. This allows them to look at a lot more information at once.

The researchers looked for all the studies that compared the two ways of making a stoma. They found 11 studies to include in their review. Most of these studies looked back at the medical records of people who already had surgery. One study randomly chose which surgery method patients would get.

**Who was in the studies?**

In total, the 11 studies included 924 people. The people in these studies were of all ages. They had a stoma for many different health reasons. Some had a stoma that was meant to be for a short time, and others had a stoma for life.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

After looking at all the information, the researchers found no clear winner.

The review showed that there was no real difference between the two surgery methods. People who had the stoma made *through* the belly muscle had a similar chance of getting a hernia as people who had it made *beside* the muscle.

The researchers also looked for other stoma problems. These included the stoma pushing out, getting blocked, or causing skin soreness. For all of these problems, neither surgery method was shown to be better than the other.

**What does this mean for patients?**

Based on the studies we have so far, we cannot say that one way of making a stoma is better for preventing a hernia.

The researchers also noted that the quality of the past studies was not very high. Some studies were small, or they were not designed in the best way. This makes it hard to be very sure about the results.

**What is the final conclusion?**

There is not enough proof to suggest that doctors should use one surgery method over the other. More and better research is needed to find the answer. Future studies will help doctors and patients make the best choices for stoma surgery.","Lateral pararectal versus transrectal stoma placement for prevention of parastomal herniation

Talking About Feelings: A Study on Therapies for Young People with Long-Term Health Issues

**Rationale**

Many children and teens live with health problems that last a long time. These can include conditions like asthma, diabetes, or cancer. In fact, more than one in ten young people has a long-term physical condition.

Living with a long-term health problem can be hard. It is common for these young people to also feel very worried or very sad. These feelings are sometimes called anxiety or depression. When these feelings are strong, they can cause problems at home, at school, and with friends. Getting help for these feelings early is very important.

We wanted to know if talking therapies could help these young people. Talking therapies are treatments where you talk with a trained person about your thoughts and feelings. Most talking therapies were made for young people who do not have long-term health problems. We were not sure if these same therapies would work well for someone who is also dealing with an illness. This study looked at past research to see if talking therapies help young people with long-term health problems feel less worried and sad.

**Trial Design**

This was not a study where we tested a new treatment. Instead, we did a review of studies that were already finished. A review lets us look at the results from many different studies all at once. This helps us get a bigger and clearer picture of what the research shows.

We searched for all high-quality studies on this topic. The studies had to include children and teens who were 18 years old or younger. All the young people in the studies had a long-term physical health problem. They also had symptoms of anxiety or depression, which means they showed signs of feeling very worried or sad.

We looked for studies that were done between the years 1970 and 2018. We found 29 studies that fit what we were looking for. In total, these studies included about 1350 young people. We looked at all the information from these studies to answer our questions.

**Results**

Our review found that a few types of talking therapies have been studied in children and teens with long-term health problems. Most of these therapies were not made just for them. They were general therapies for any young person.

We found that some of these talking therapies can help. They were good at reducing mild feelings of worry and sadness for a short time. A type of therapy called cognitive behavior therapy, or CBT, seemed to work well. CBT is a type of talking therapy that helps people understand and change their patterns of thinking and acting.

However, we did not find much proof that young people found these therapies easy or helpful to do. There was also not much information to show that the therapies helped improve their overall life quality. We also found a gap in the research. There are not many therapies designed to help young people with worries that are directly about their health.

Based on our review, we believe more work needs to be done. Researchers should create new talking therapies. These new therapies should be made specifically for children and teens who are dealing with both a long-term health problem and feelings of sadness or worry.","Psychological therapies for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions

10.1002-14651858.CD013743.pub2,"Background
Antibiotics have been considered to treat ulcerative colitis (UC) due to their antimicrobial properties against intestinal bacteria linked to inflammation. However, there are concerns about their efficacy and safety. 
Objectives
To determine whether antibiotic therapy is safe and effective for the induction and maintenance of remission in people with UC. 
Search methods
We searched five electronic databases on 10 December 2021 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotic therapy to placebo or an active comparator. 
Selection criteria
We considered people with UC of all ages, treated with antibiotics of any type, dose, and route of administration for inclusion. Induction studies required a minimum duration of two weeks for inclusion. Maintenance studies required a minimum duration of three months to be considered for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome for induction studies was failure to achieve remission and for maintenance studies was relapse, as defined by the primary studies. 
Main results
We included 12 RCTs (847 participants). One maintenance of remission study used sole antibiotic therapy compared with 5‐aminosalicylic acid (5‐ASA). All other trials used concurrent medications or standard care regimens and antibiotics as an adjunct therapy or compared antibiotics with other adjunct therapies to examine the effect on induction of remission. 
There is high certainty evidence that antibiotics (154/304 participants) compared to placebo (175/304 participants) result in no difference in failure to achieve clinical remission (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.06). A subgroup analysis found no differences when steroids, steroids plus 5‐ASA, or steroids plus 5‐ASA plus probiotics were used as additional therapies to antibiotics and placebo. 
There is low certainty evidence that antibiotics (102/168 participants) compared to placebo (121/175 participants) may result in no difference in failure to achieve clinical response (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.22). A subgroup analysis found no differences when steroids or steroids plus 5‐ASA were used as additional therapies to antibiotics and placebo. 
There is low certainty evidence that antibiotics (6/342 participants) compared to placebo (5/349 participants) may result in no difference in serious adverse events (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.71). A subgroup analysis found no differences when steroids were additional therapies to antibiotics and placebo. 
There is low certainty evidence that antibiotics (3/342 participants) compared to placebo (1/349 participants) may result in no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 2.06, 95% CI 0.27 to 15.72). A subgroup analysis found no differences when steroids or steroids plus 5‐ASA were additional therapies to antibiotics and placebo. 
It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics in combination with probiotics compared to no treatment or placebo for failure to achieve clinical remission (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.19), serious adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.08), or withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.08). The certainty of the evidence is very low. 
It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics compared to 5‐ASA for failure to achieve clinical remission (RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.17 to 4.14). The certainty of the evidence is very low. 
It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics compared to probiotics for failure to achieve clinical remission (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.94). The certainty of the evidence is very low. 
It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics compared to 5‐ASA for failure to maintain clinical remission (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.06). The certainty of the evidence is very low. 
It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics compared to no treatment for failure to achieve clinical remission in a mixed population of people with active and inactive disease (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.07). The certainty of the evidence is very low. 
For all other outcomes, no effects could be estimated due to a lack of data.
Authors' conclusions
There is high certainty evidence that there is no difference between antibiotics and placebo in the proportion of people who achieve clinical remission at the end of the intervention period. However, there is evidence that there may be a greater proportion of people who achieve clinical remission and probably a greater proportion who achieve clinical response with antibiotics when compared with placebo at 12 months. There may be no difference in serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events between antibiotics and placebo. 
No clear conclusions can be drawn for any other comparisons.
A clear direction for future research appears to be comparisons of antibiotics and placebo (in addition to standard therapies) with longer‐term measurement of outcomes. Additionally. As there were single studies of other head‐to‐head comparisons, there may be scope for future studies in this area.

Do Antibiotics Help Treat Ulcerative Colitis?

**Rationale**
Ulcerative colitis, or UC, is a long-term health problem. It causes the large gut, also called the large intestine, to get swollen and sore. This can cause pain, diarrhea, and other issues that make life hard for people.

Some doctors thought that certain germs (bacteria) in the gut might make UC worse. Antibiotics are medicines that kill germs. So, researchers wondered if antibiotics could help treat UC by getting rid of these harmful germs.

But we were not sure if antibiotics really worked for UC or if they were safe to use. This study was done to see if taking antibiotics is a safe and helpful way to make UC symptoms get better and to keep them from coming back.

**Trial Design**
This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results of 12 older studies. This is called a review. It helps to combine information to get a stronger answer. A total of 847 people with UC were in these 12 studies.

The people in the studies were of all ages. They were put into groups by chance. One group took an antibiotic. The other group took a ""placebo,"" which is a sugar pill with no medicine in it. Using a sugar pill helps researchers see if the real medicine is actually working.

In most studies, people took the antibiotic or sugar pill along with their usual UC medicines. The studies lasted for a few weeks to a few months. Researchers wanted to see if adding an antibiotic helped people's UC get better.

**Results**
The main question was if antibiotics helped people's UC symptoms go away. When symptoms go away, it is called ""remission.""

The researchers found strong proof that antibiotics worked no better than a sugar pill. The number of people whose UC got better was about the same in the antibiotic group and the sugar pill group. This means adding an antibiotic to usual UC treatment did not help people get into remission in the short term.

The researchers also looked at side effects. They did not see a clear difference in serious health problems between people who took antibiotics and those who took the sugar pill. The number of people who had to stop treatment because of side effects was also about the same in both groups.

The study authors concluded that there is very good proof that antibiotics do not help calm active UC when added to other treatments. The authors said that more research is needed to see if antibiotics might help over a longer time, like a full year. For now, this review shows that using antibiotics is likely not a helpful treatment for most people with UC.","The use of antibiotics in the treatment of ulcerative colitis
What was the aim of this review? 
This Cochrane Review aimed to determine whether antibiotics are useful and safe for people with ulcerative colitis (UC) in achieving or maintaining remission. 
Key messages 
We found that antibiotics, when added to standard therapies, are similar to placebo in how often they fail to achieve remission or disease improvement for people with UC, measured up to three months from taking them. 
We found that antibiotics when compared to placebo may be useful in achieving remission or some improvement of UC symptoms, measured at 12 months from taking them. 
In terms of safety, the evidence is of low certainty, but antibiotics may be as safe as placebo. 
We have confidence in the findings up to three months, but have less confidence in the evidence at 12 months due to low numbers of study participants. 
What is ulcerative colitis? 
UC is a chronic (long term) inflammatory disease that affects the large bowel. The most common symptoms include bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and a sudden almost uncontrollable urge to pass stool. Some people have other symptoms including sore joints, mouth sores, and inflammation in their eyes. When someone is experiencing symptoms of UC, they are said to have 'active' disease. When symptoms improve with treatment, the disease is said to be responding to therapy. When symptoms stop, the disease is said to be in 'remission'. People with UC in remission are often given therapy with medicines to try and prolong (maintain) their remission or response to therapy. 
What did the review study? 
This review studied the use of antibiotics in the treatment of UC. Eleven studies considered antibiotics as a therapy for achieving remission and one study as therapy for maintaining remission. 
Antibiotics could theoretically be helpful as they might be able to fight harmful bacteria in the gut that are thought to be a partial cause for the presence of UC symptoms. 
Currently, most doctors do not recommend the use of antibiotics unless the patient has an infection. 
What were the main results of the review? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing antibiotics with another treatment or dummy treatment. We found 12 RCTs including 847 participants. The trials looked at people of all ages; using different types and doses of antibiotics; and at antibiotics taken as tablets, injections, or any other way. The main results from our review are as follows. 
1. Antibiotics, when added to standard therapies, are no different from placebo in failing to achieve remission or improve disease symptoms for people with UC when measured up to three months from taking them. 
2. Antibiotics probably fail less than placebo in achieving remission or some improvement of UC symptoms measured at 12 months from taking them. 
3. In terms of safety, antibiotics may be similar to placebo, but the evidence is of low certainty. 
4. We are uncertain about how antibiotics compare to other treatments because there is not enough good evidence to make a judgement. 
Conclusion 
There is no difference between antibiotics and placebo when added to standard therapies to achieve remission or improvement of symptoms in the short term. However, they may help to lessen the number of people who do not achieve remission, and they probably lead to fewer numbers of people who have not achieved improvement of symptoms at 12 months. 
No conclusions can be drawn on other treatments or safety due to lack of evidence, even though there may be a possibility that antibiotics are as safe as placebo. Further research would be needed to clarify the usefulness of antibiotics in the treatment of UC; however, such studies should focus on longer‐term outcomes given the findings of this review.

10.1002-14651858.CD013432.pub2,"Background
Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a major cause of hospital admissions, disease‐related morbidity and mortality. COPD is a heterogeneous disease with distinct inflammatory phenotypes, including eosinophilia, which may drive acute exacerbations in a subgroup of patients. Monoclonal antibodies targeting interleukin 5 (IL‐5) or its receptor (IL‐5R) have a role in the care of people with severe eosinophilic asthma, and may similarly provide therapeutic benefit for people with COPD of eosinophilic phenotype. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of monoclonal antibody therapies targeting IL‐5 signalling (anti‐IL‐5 or anti‐IL‐5Rα) compared with placebo in the treatment of adults with COPD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, clinical trials registries, manufacturers' websites, and reference lists of included studies. Our most recent search was 23 September 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials comparing anti‐IL‐5 therapy with placebo in adults with COPD. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and analysed outcomes using a random‐effects model.The primary outcomes were exacerbations requiring antibiotics or oral steroids, hospitalisations due to exacerbation of COPD, serious adverse events, and quality of life. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
Six studies involving a total of 5542 participants met our inclusion criteria. Three studies used mepolizumab (1530 participants), and three used benralizumab (4012 participants). The studies were on people with COPD, which was similarly defined with a documented history of COPD for at least one year. We deemed the risk of bias to be generally low, with all studies contributing data of robust methodology. 
Mepolizumab 100 mg reduces the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations by 19% in those with an eosinophil count of at least 150/μL (rate ratio (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 0.93; participants = 911; studies = 2, high‐certainty evidence). When participants with lower eosinophils are included, mepolizumab 100 mg probably reduces the exacerbation rate by 8% (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.03; participants = 1285; studies = 2, moderate‐certainty evidence). Mepolizumab 300 mg probably reduces the rate of exacerbations by 14% in participants all of whom had raised eosinophils (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.06; participants = 451; studies = 1, moderate‐certainty evidence); the evidence was uncertain for a single small study of mepolizumab 750 mg. In participants with high eosinophils, mepolizumab probably reduces the rate of hospitalisation by 10% (100 mg, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.24; participants = 911; studies = 2, moderate‐certainty evidence) and 17% (300 mg, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.35; participants = 451; studies = 1, moderate‐certainty evidence). Mepolizumab 100 mg increases the time to first moderate or severe exacerbation compared to the placebo group, in people with the eosinophilic phenotype (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.92; participants = 981; studies 2, high‐certainty evidence). When participants with lower eosinophils were included this difference was smaller and less certain (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.0; participants = 1285; studies 2, moderate‐certainty evidence). Mepolizumab 300 mg probably increases the time to first moderate or severe exacerbation in participants who all had eosinophilic phenotype (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.99; participants = 451; studies = 1, moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Benralizumab 100 mg reduces the rate of severe exacerbations requiring hospitalisation in those with an eosinophil count of at least 220/μL (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.81; participants = 1512; studies = 2, high‐certainty evidence). Benralizumab 10 mg probably reduces the rate of severe exacerbations requiring hospitalisation in those with an eosinophil count of at least 220/μL (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.94; participants = 765; studies = 1, moderate‐certainty evidence). 
There was probably little or no difference between the intervention and placebo for quality of life measures. Where there were differences the mean difference fell below the pre‐specified minimum clinically significant difference. 
Treatment with mepolizumab and benralizumab appeared to be safe. All pooled analyses showed that there was probably little or no difference in serious adverse events, adverse events, or side effects between the use of a monoclonal antibody therapy compared to placebo. 
Authors' conclusions
We found that mepolizumab and benralizumab probably reduce the rate of moderate and severe exacerbations in the highly selected group of people who have both COPD and higher levels of blood eosinophils. This highlights the importance of disease phenotyping in COPD, and may play a role in the personalised treatment strategy in disease management. 
Further research is needed to elucidate the role of monoclonal antibodies in the management of COPD in clinical practice. In particular, it is not clear whether there is a threshold blood eosinophil level above which these drugs may be effective. Studies including cost effectiveness analysis may be beneficial given the high cost of these therapies, to support use if appropriate.

A Review of New Drugs to Prevent Flare-ups in Some People with COPD

### **Rationale**

COPD is a lung disease that makes it hard to breathe. Many people with COPD have times when their symptoms get much worse. These are called flare-ups. Flare-ups can be very serious. They are a main reason why people with COPD have to go to the hospital.

Doctors know that there are different types of COPD. Some people have a type caused by too many of a certain white blood cell. These cells are called eosinophils (e-o-SIN-o-fills). High levels of these cells can cause swelling in the lungs, which can lead to flare-ups.

Two new drugs, mepolizumab and benralizumab, may help. They are a special type of medicine that lowers the number of eosinophil cells in the body. These drugs already help people with a type of severe asthma caused by high eosinophils.

This study looked at past research to answer an important question. Can these drugs also help people who have COPD with high eosinophil levels? Researchers wanted to know if the drugs could safely reduce flare-ups for these patients.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results from past studies to get a stronger answer. They looked for studies that were designed in a very fair way.

In those studies, people were put into groups by chance. One group got a real drug, either mepolizumab or benralizumab. The other group got a placebo. A placebo is a dummy medicine, like a sugar pill, that has no drug in it. Using a placebo helps researchers see if the real drug is what truly made a difference.

This review looked at 6 studies in total. The studies included over 5,500 adults. All of them had been diagnosed with COPD for at least one year. The studies compared people taking one of the new drugs to people taking the placebo.

### **Results**

The researchers found that the new drugs helped a specific group of people. They helped people who had both COPD and high levels of eosinophil cells in their blood.

**Mepolizumab**
For people with high eosinophil levels, this drug lowered the number of flare-ups.
*   For every 10 flare-ups in the group taking the dummy medicine, the group taking mepolizumab had about 8.
*   People taking this drug also went a longer time before having their first flare-up compared to those taking the dummy medicine.

**Benralizumab**
This drug also helped people with high eosinophil levels.
*   It lowered the number of severe flare-ups that were bad enough to need a hospital stay.
*   For every 10 severe flare-ups that sent people to the hospital in the dummy medicine group, there were about 6 in the benralizumab group.

**Other Results**
The drugs did not seem to improve people’s day-to-day quality of life. This means people taking the drugs did not report feeling better overall compared to those taking the placebo.

The drugs were found to be safe. People who took the new drugs did not have more serious side effects than people who took the placebo.

**What this means**
The authors of the review concluded that these drugs can help reduce flare-ups, but only for people with a specific type of COPD. This shows how important it is for doctors to know which type of COPD a person has. This can help them choose the best treatment for each person.

More research is needed to know the exact level of eosinophils where these drugs start to work. Because the drugs are very expensive, it is also important to study if their benefits are worth the high cost.","Mepolizumab or benralizumab for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
Background to the question 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung condition in which people can experience severe difficulties with breathing and an associated reduction in their quality of life. 
For people with COPD, episodes in which the condition of patients seriously worsens are a major concern. We examined the findings of clinical trials to see whether mepolizumab or benralizumab, two new drugs, are better than placebo (dummy treatment) for people with COPD, and whether they reduce the number of episodes when the condition of patients seriously worsens. 
Study characteristics 
Six clinical studies compared either mepolizumab or benralizumab to placebo in a total of 5542 people with COPD. We examined the findings of the studies in terms of episodes when patients' conditions flared up requiring additional treatment, patient quality of life, patient performance in breathing tests, and side effects of the medication. 
Main results 
Three studies used mepolizumab, and the other three studies used benralizumab.
Mepolizumab 100 mg reduced the rate of flare‐ups in a group of people with both COPD and higher levels of blood eosinophils (a type of white blood cells involved in inflammatory and allergic reactions). When mepolizumab is given in a higher dose (300 mg or 750 mg) the rate of flare‐ups is probably reduced. 
Benralizumab at a dose of 100mg resulted in a clear reduction in the number of episodes requiring admission to hospital, and when given at a lower dose (10mg) probably reduces flare‐ups requiring hospitalisation. This is in people with COPD and higher levels of blood eosinophils. 
Further studies comparing mepolizumab or benralizumab to a placebo may provide more clarity on the role of these drugs for COPD. 
Quality of the evidence 
The included studies were for the most part very well‐designed and robust, and the evidence was generally of high quality.

Diabetes and vascular disease are the leading causes of lower limb amputation. Currently, 463 million adults are living with diabetes, and 202 million with peripheral vascular disease, worldwide. When a lower limb amputation is considered, preservation of the knee in a below‐knee amputation allows for superior functional recovery when compared with amputation at a higher level. When a below‐knee amputation is not feasible, the most common alternative performed is an above‐knee amputation. Another possible option, which is less commonly performed, is a through‐knee amputation which may offer some potential functional benefits over an above‐knee amputation. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of through‐knee amputation compared to above‐knee amputation on clinical and rehabilitation outcomes and complication rates for all patients undergoing vascular and non‐vascular major lower limb amputation. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases; the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and the ClinicalTrials.gov trials register to 17 February 2021. 
We undertook reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
Published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing through‐knee amputation and above‐knee amputation were eligible for inclusion in this study. Primary outcomes were uncomplicated primary wound healing and prosthetic limb fitting. Secondary outcomes included time taken to achieve independent mobility with a prosthesis, health‐related quality of life, walking speed, pain, and 30‐day survival. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently reviewed all records identified by the search. Data collection and extraction were planned in line with recommendations outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We planned to assess the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We did not identify RCTs that met the inclusion criteria for this review.
Authors' conclusions
No RCTs have been conducted to determine comparative clinical or rehabilitation outcomes of through‐knee amputation and above‐knee amputation, or complication rates. It is unknown whether either of these approaches offers improved outcomes for patients. RCTs are needed to guide practice and to ensure the best outcomes for this patient group.

### **Plain Title**

Which is a Better Type of Leg Amputation: Through the Knee or Above the Knee?

### **Rationale**

Some health problems can affect the blood flow in our bodies. This is called vascular disease. Diabetes can also cause problems with blood flow. When blood does not flow well to the legs, the tissue can get damaged. In some cases, doctors may need to remove part of the leg. This surgery is called an amputation.

Losing a part of a leg is a major life change. Doctors always try to save as much of the leg as possible. It is best if they can save the knee. This is called a below-knee amputation. It helps people move around better and use an artificial leg after surgery.

Sometimes, a below-knee amputation is not possible. In this case, there are two other choices. One is an amputation through the knee joint. The other is an amputation above the knee. Some doctors think an amputation through the knee might help people recover better.

But we do not know for sure which one is better. This study was done to find out. Researchers wanted to see if one type of amputation helps people more than the other. They wanted to find the best way to help patients.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a study that involved new patients. Instead, researchers looked for studies that were already completed. This type of study is called a review. The goal was to find all the best research on this topic in one place.

Researchers looked for a specific type of study. These studies are called Randomized Controlled Trials, or RCTs. An RCT is the best way to compare two treatments fairly. In an RCT, patients are put into groups by chance. One group gets one type of surgery. The other group gets the other type of surgery. Then doctors compare how each group does.

The researchers looked for studies that compared amputation through the knee with amputation above the knee. They wanted to see what these studies said about a few important things:
*   How well the surgery wound healed.
*   If patients were able to get an artificial leg, also called a prosthesis.
*   How long it took for patients to walk on their own with an artificial leg.
*   How the surgery affected a person’s quality of life.

The researchers looked in many online places where medical studies are stored. They searched for studies from all over the world.

### **Results**

The researchers carefully looked for any studies that compared the two types of amputations. After a very wide search, they did not find any.

There were no RCTs that matched what the researchers were looking for. This means there are no high-quality studies that have directly compared an amputation through the knee to one above the knee.

Because no studies were found, we still do not know which surgery is better for patients. We do not know if one helps people recover faster. We also do not know if one has fewer problems after surgery than the other.

The researchers concluded that we need new studies. Good studies are needed to compare these two types of amputations. This research would help doctors and patients make the best decision. The results would help make sure people who need this surgery get the best care and can live their lives as fully as possible.","Does surgical removal of the lower leg (amputation) through the knee offer patients improved surgical recovery and better rehabilitation than amputation above the knee? 
Background 
Each year, thousands of people worldwide need to have their lower leg surgically removed (lower limb amputation) due to problems such as blockages in blood vessels (vascular disease), diabetes, and injury. When an amputation is planned, a surgeon needs to decide how high up the leg to go, and therefore how much leg to leave behind. This decision is based on a balance between leaving as much of the leg as possible to improve a person’s ability to walk with an artificial leg (prosthesis) and removing anything that will not survive or go on to heal. If possible, a surgeon will prefer to preserve the knee, as having a working knee of one's own ensures a person’s best chance of walking. In some cases, this is not possible, and currently almost all people in this situation will have an amputation in the middle of the thigh (above the knee). However, another option is an amputation that can be performed through the knee joint itself. This carries potential advantages, as all of the muscles controlling movements of the thighbone are undamaged. A longer remaining leg would be expected to act as a lever to reduce the effort of swinging a prosthetic limb during walking and to aid sitting balance and transfer from bed to chair. By avoiding cutting the muscles, it is possible to minimise the physical trauma of surgery, allowing a procedure with reduced blood loss and less procedure time. In addition, the end of the thighbone and in some cases the knee cap remain. These bones can support the body’s weight at the end of the remaining limb through the same mechanism as kneeling down. On the other hand, some surgeons think that problems with healing may be more common with this approach. It is unclear whether amputation through the knee may therefore be a better operation, allowing improved recovery, greater likelihood of being able to walk with an artificial leg, and better quality of life, or whether it is associated with worse outcomes due to wound healing failure and the need for further surgery. The aim of this review was to look at the best available evidence to see how these operations compare.  
This review searched for studies that looked at whether through‐the‐knee or above‐the‐knee amputation resulted in better wound healing after amputation, improved patient survival, and reduced pain (clinical outcomes), as well as better rates of prosthesis use, walking speed, and quality of life (rehabilitation outcomes). 
Study characteristics and key results 
A thorough search of the available literature was performed (up to 17 February 2021) to find studies comparing through‐knee with above‐knee amputation. We identified no studies comparing these two procedures. 
Certainty of the evidence 
We were unable to assess the certainty of evidence because of the absence of studies included in this review. 
Conclusion 
Due to a lack of randomised trials, we are unable to determine if through‐knee amputations have different outcomes from above‐knee amputations. High‐quality randomised controlled trials are required to provide evidence on this topic.

10.1002-14651858.CD013057.pub2,"Benefits and risks of ear cleaning for people with chronic suppurative otitis media (persistent or recurring ear infection with discharge of pus) 
Why this is important 
Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), also known as chronic otitis media (COM), is an inflammation and infection of the middle ear that lasts for two weeks or more. People with CSOM usually experience recurrent or persistent ear discharge – pus that leaks out from a hole in the eardrum – and hearing loss. 
Different approaches can be used to clean the affected ears and remove discharge. These include: 
‐ using cotton wool or tissue paper (dry mopping);‐ sucking up material blocking the ear with a small device (usually done under a microscope); or‐ washing out the ear (irrigation). 
To find out how effective ear cleaning is in people with CSOM, and whether it causes unwanted effects, we reviewed the evidence from research studies. In particular, we wanted to know whether ear cleaning stopped ear discharge, and whether it affected health‐related quality of life, or hearing. We also wanted to know if it caused pain, discomfort or irritation in the ear, unwanted effects such as dizziness or ear bleeding, or any serious complications. 
How we identified and assessed the evidence 
First, we searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. We considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. 
What we found 
We found three studies in 431 people with CSOM. People were followed for between six weeks and six months after treatment. 
The studies compared:
‐ daily dry mopping versus no treatment (two studies, 351 people);‐ daily suction combined with antibiotic ear drops administered in a clinic, versus one instance of suction only (in a clinic) followed by daily self‐administered antibiotic ear drops (one study, 80 people). 
Daily dry mopping compared against no treatment 
‐ We do not know whether dry mopping stops ear discharge, because the evidence on whether people experienced discharge after four weeks was of very low certainty, and no studies looked at the presence of discharge earlier. 
‐ One study reported serious complications, but it was not clear whether the people who reported complications had their ears cleaned with dry mopping or not, or whether the complications occurred before or after treatment. We therefore could not tell whether dry mopping caused serious complications, or how often these occurred. 
‐ One study looked at hearing, but did not report the results in a way that could tell us whether or not dry mopping affects hearing. 
‐ No studies investigated the impact of dry mopping on health‐related quality of life, ear pain, dizziness or ear bleeding. 
Daily suction compared against one instance of suction only, in addition to antibiotic ear drops 
‐ We do not know whether suction stops ear discharge, because the evidence for between one and two weeks after treatment was of very low certainty, and the results for discharge after four weeks could not be interpreted. 
‐ We do not know if suction affects hearing or dizziness, as the evidence was of very low certainty. 
‐ No studies investigated the impact of suction on health‐related quality of life, ear pain, serious complications or ear bleeding. 
What this means 
We do not know how effective ear cleaning is for people with CSOM, and whether it causes unwanted effects. There are very few studies in this area, and these provide very low‐certainty evidence. Unwanted effects were not well reported in the studies we found. We need researchers to conduct future studies that compare ear cleaning to no cleaning, and compare different cleaning techniques and frequency, so that we can assess the benefits and risks of ear cleaning for people with CSOM.

Does Cleaning the Ear Help with Long-Term Ear Infections?

**Rationale**
A long-term ear infection is a health problem that lasts for two weeks or more. It is an infection in the middle part of the ear. People with this condition often have pus that leaks out of their ear. This can happen over and over again. They may also have hearing loss. This condition can be a burden for people who have it.

Doctors sometimes clean the ear to remove the pus. They might use cotton wool to dry the ear. This is called dry mopping. They might also use a small tool to suck out the pus. This is called suction.

Researchers wanted to know if cleaning the ear really helps. They looked to see if it could stop the pus and improve hearing. They also wanted to know if ear cleaning was safe. This study was needed to find out the good and bad effects of cleaning the ear for people with these long-term infections.

**Trial Design**
This was a review study. This means the researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they looked for all the studies that had already been done on this topic. They gathered the results from those studies and compared them.

The researchers found three studies to look at. These studies included a total of 431 people with long-term ear infections. The studies followed these people for six weeks to six months after their treatment.

The studies compared different treatments:
*   Two studies compared cleaning the ear daily with cotton wool to no treatment at all.
*   One study looked at people who all used antibiotic ear drops. It compared cleaning the ear with a suction tool every day to cleaning it only one time.

**Results**
The researchers found that the proof from these studies was not very strong. They were not sure about the results. This means we still do not know if cleaning the ear is helpful or harmful.

**Cleaning with cotton wool (dry mopping)**
The studies that looked at dry mopping did not give clear answers. The researchers could not tell if daily cleaning stopped the pus from coming out of the ear. The studies also did not give clear information about any harms. We do not know if cleaning the ear with cotton wool causes problems or makes hearing better or worse.

**Cleaning with a suction tool**
The study that looked at suction also did not give clear answers. The researchers could not tell if cleaning the ear every day with a suction tool worked better than cleaning it just once. We do not know if it helps stop the pus, or if it affects hearing or causes dizziness.

**What this means for patients**
From this review, we do not know if ear cleaning is a good treatment for long-term ear infections. The studies were too small and did not give enough information. The harms of ear cleaning were not reported well.

The researchers concluded that we need more and better studies. Future studies should compare different cleaning methods to no cleaning. This will help doctors and patients understand the true benefits and risks of cleaning the ear.

Behavioural activation is a brief psychotherapeutic approach that seeks to change the way a person interacts with their environment. Behavioural activation is increasingly receiving attention as a potentially cost‐effective intervention for depression, which may require less resources and may be easier to deliver and implement than other types of psychotherapy. 
Objectives
To examine the effects of behavioural activation compared with other psychological therapies for depression in adults. 
To examine the effects of behavioural activation compared with medication for depression in adults. 
To examine the effects of behavioural activation compared with treatment as usual/waiting list/placebo no treatment for depression in adults. 
Search methods
We searched CCMD‐CTR (all available years), CENTRAL (current issue), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 onwards), Ovid EMBASE (1980 onwards), and Ovid PsycINFO (1806 onwards) on the 17 January 2020 to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 'behavioural activation', or the main elements of behavioural activation for depression in participants with clinically diagnosed depression or subthreshold depression. We did not apply any restrictions on date, language or publication status to the searches. We searched international trials registries via the World Health Organization's trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify unpublished or ongoing trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of behavioural activation for the treatment of depression or symptoms of depression in adults aged 18 or over. We excluded RCTs conducted in inpatient settings and with trial participants selected because of a physical comorbidity. Studies were included regardless of reported outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened all titles/abstracts and full‐text manuscripts for inclusion. Data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessments were also performed by two review authors in duplicate. Where necessary, we contacted study authors for more information. 
Main results
Fifty‐three studies with 5495 participants were included; 51 parallel group RCTs and two cluster‐RCTs. 
We found moderate‐certainty evidence that behavioural activation had greater short‐term efficacy than treatment as usual (risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10 to 1.78; 7 RCTs, 1533 participants), although this difference was no longer evident in sensitivity analyses using a worst‐case or intention‐to‐treat scenario. Compared with waiting list, behavioural activation may be more effective, but there were fewer data in this comparison and evidence was of low certainty (RR 2.14, 95% CI 0.90 to 5.09; 1 RCT, 26 participants). No evidence on treatment efficacy was available for behavioural activation versus placebo and behavioural activation versus no treatment. 
We found moderate‐certainty evidence suggesting no evidence of a difference in short‐term treatment efficacy between behavioural activation and CBT (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.07; 5 RCTs, 601 participants). Fewer data were available for other comparators. No evidence of a difference in short term‐efficacy was found between behavioural activation and third‐wave CBT (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.33; 2 RCTs, 98 participants; low certainty), and psychodynamic therapy (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.99; 1 RCT,60 participants; very low certainty). Behavioural activation was more effective than humanistic therapy (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.95; 2 RCTs, 46 participants; low certainty) and medication (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.76; 1 RCT; 141 participants; moderate certainty), but both of these results were based on a small number of trials and participants. No evidence on treatment efficacy was available for comparisons between behavioural activation versus interpersonal, cognitive analytic, and integrative therapies. 
There was moderate‐certainty evidence that behavioural activation might have lower treatment acceptability (based on dropout rate) than treatment as usual in the short term, although the data did not confirm a difference and results lacked precision (RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.81 to 3.31; 14 RCTs, 2518 participants). Moderate‐certainty evidence did not suggest any difference in short‐term acceptability between behavioural activation and waiting list (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.93; 8 RCTs. 359 participants), no treatment (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.09; 3 RCTs, 187 participants), medication (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.16; 2 RCTs, 243 participants), or placebo (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.67; 1 RCT; 96 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No evidence on treatment acceptability was available comparing behavioural activation versus psychodynamic therapy. 
Low‐certainty evidence did not show a difference in short‐term treatment acceptability (dropout rate) between behavioural activation and CBT (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.25; 12 RCTs, 1195 participants), third‐wave CBT (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.10; 3 RCTs, 147 participants); humanistic therapy (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.20 to 5.55; 2 RCTs, 96 participants) (very low certainty), and interpersonal, cognitive analytic, and integrative therapy (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.20; 4 RCTs, 123 participants). 
Results from medium‐ and long‐term primary outcomes, secondary outcomes, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity analyses are summarised in the text. 
Authors' conclusions
This systematic review suggests that behavioural activation may be more effective than humanistic therapy, medication, and treatment as usual, and that it may be no less effective than CBT, psychodynamic therapy, or being placed on a waiting list. However, our confidence in these findings is limited due to concerns about the certainty of the evidence. 
We found no evidence of a difference in short‐term treatment acceptability (based on dropouts) between behavioural activation and most comparison groups (CBT, humanistic therapy, waiting list, placebo, medication, no treatment or treatment as usual). Again, our confidence in all these findings is limited due to concerns about the certainty of the evidence. 
No data were available about the efficacy of behavioural activation compared with placebo, or about treatment acceptability comparing behavioural activation and psychodynamic therapy, interpersonal, cognitive analytic and integrative therapies. 
The evidence could be strengthened by better reporting and better quality RCTs of behavioural activation and by assessing working mechanisms of behavioural activation.

Comparing a Simple Talk Therapy to Other Treatments for Depression

### **Rationale**

Depression is a common illness. It can make you feel very sad and hopeless. You may lose interest in doing things you once enjoyed. These feelings can last for a long time and make daily life hard.

There are many ways to treat depression, including talk therapy and medicine. This review looks at a simple type of talk therapy called behavioural activation. We will call it BA for short.

BA helps people to slowly start doing activities again. These activities are often things that they enjoy or that give them a sense of purpose. Because BA is a simple therapy, it may cost less and be easier for therapists to learn and provide to patients.

Researchers wanted to know if this simple therapy works as well as other, more complex treatments. They did this review to bring together all the research on BA to see how well it works compared to other options.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at all the good studies that have already been done on this topic. This is called a systematic review. It helps to get a big-picture view of what the science says.

The researchers looked for studies that compared different treatments in a fair way. These studies are called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, people are put into groups by chance to receive different treatments. This is the best way to compare them.

In total, the review included 53 different studies. These studies involved about 5,500 adults who had depression. The people in the studies were all 18 years or older.

The studies compared adults who received BA to adults who received other treatments. These other treatments included:
*   Other types of talk therapy.
*   Medicines for depression.
*   The usual care a person gets from their doctor.
*   Being on a waiting list to get treatment.

### **Results**

Here is what the researchers found when they looked at all the studies together:

*   **BA compared to usual care:** BA seemed to work better for depression than the usual care people get from their regular doctor.
*   **BA compared to other talk therapies:** BA seemed to work just as well as a common and more complex talk therapy called Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). BA seemed to work better than another kind of talk therapy called humanistic therapy.
*   **BA compared to medicine:** BA also seemed to work better than taking medicine for depression.
*   **Staying in treatment:** Researchers also looked at how many people dropped out of treatment. About the same number of people stayed with BA therapy as with other treatments. This suggests that people find BA to be an acceptable treatment.

The researchers noted that we need to be careful with these results. For some of these findings, the proof was not very strong. This was because some of the studies were small, or the way they were done made the results less clear.

In conclusion, this review suggests that BA may be a good treatment choice for adults with depression. It may work better than some common treatments, and it seems to work just as well as others. However, we need more and better studies in the future to be more certain about these findings.","Behavioural activation therapy for depression in adults
Review question 
In this Cochrane review, we wanted to find out how well behavioural activation therapy works for depression in adults. 
Why this is important 
Depression is a common mental health problem that can cause a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest in people, activities, and things that were once enjoyable. A person with depression may feel tearful, irritable, or tired most of the time, and may have problems with sleep, concentration, and memory. These and other symptoms can make daily life more difficult than usual. 
Treatments for depression include medications (antidepressants) and psychological therapies (talking therapies). Behavioural activation is a type of psychological therapy that encourages a person to develop or get back into activities which are meaningful to them. The therapy involved scheduling activities and monitoring behaviours and looking at specific situations where changing these behaviours and activities may be helpful. A therapist may support people in person, over the phone, or online, usually over multiple sessions. 
It is important to know whether behavioural activation could be an effective and acceptable treatment to offer to people with depression. 
What we did 
In January 2020, we searched for studies of behavioural activation therapy for depression in adults (aged over 18 years). We looked for randomised controlled trials, in which treatments were given to study participants at random; these studies give the most reliable evidence. 
We included 53 studies involving 5495 participants. The studies compared behavioural activation with no treatment, standard or usual care, a dummy treatment (placebo), taking medications, being on a waiting list for treatment, or other psychotherapies (cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), third‐wave CBT, humanistic therapy, psychodynamic therapy, and integrative therapy). 
The studies were conducted in 14 countries; most were conducted in the USA (27 studies). Most studies lasted from four to 16 weeks. 
The outcomes we focussed on were how well the treatments worked and whether they were acceptable to participants. How well treatments worked (efficacy) was measured by the number of people who responded well to treatment or no longer met criteria for depression at the end of treatment. Acceptability was measured by counting how many people dropped out during the study. 
What did we find? 
Behavioural activation may treat depression better than receiving usual care. We were uncertain whether behavioural activation worked better than medication or being on a waiting list, and we found no evidence for this outcome comparing behavioural activation to no treatment or placebo treatment. 
We found no differences between behavioural activation and CBT in treating depression. Although we did not find enough evidence to compare behavioural activation reliably with other psychotherapies, it may work better than humanistic therapy, and we found no differences between behavioural activation and third‐wave CBT or psychodynamic therapy. No evidence was available comparing behavioural activation to integrative therapies. 
Behavioural activation is probably less acceptable to people than usual care. We found no differences in acceptability of behavioural activation compared with being on a waiting list, no treatment, taking antidepressants, or receiving a placebo treatment. We also found no differences in acceptability between behavioural activation and other psychotherapies studied (CBT, third‐wave CBT, humanistic therapy, integrative therapies). For behavioural activation compared with psychodynamic therapy, we found no evidence on treatment acceptability. 
Conclusions 
Behavioural activation may be an effective and acceptable treatment for depression in adults. Offering this therapy in practice would give people with depression greater treatment choice, and different formats and types of delivery could be explored to meet the demand for mental health support. Our confidence in these findings is limited due to concerns about the certainty of the evidence. 
Most findings were short‐term, meaning that we cannot be sure behavioural activation would be helpful to people with depression in the longer term. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Our certainty (confidence) in the evidence is mostly low to moderate. Some findings are based on only a few studies, with poorly reported results, in which the participants knew which treatment they received. Therefore, we are not sure how reliable the results are. Our conclusions may change if more studies are conducted.

10.1002-14651858.CD015077,"Background
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represents the most severe course of COVID‐19 (caused by the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus), usually resulting in a prolonged stay in an intensive care unit (ICU) and high mortality rates. Despite the fact that most affected individuals need invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), evidence on specific ventilation strategies for ARDS caused by COVID‐19 is scarce. Spontaneous breathing during IMV is part of a therapeutic concept comprising light levels of sedation and the avoidance of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA). This approach is potentially associated with both advantages (e.g. a preserved diaphragmatic motility and an optimised ventilation‐perfusion ratio of the ventilated lung), as well as risks (e.g. a higher rate of ventilator‐induced lung injury or a worsening of pulmonary oedema due to increases in transpulmonary pressure). As a consequence, spontaneous breathing in people with COVID‐19‐ARDS who are receiving IMV is subject to an ongoing debate amongst intensivists. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of early spontaneous breathing activity in invasively ventilated people with COVID‐19 with ARDS compared to ventilation strategies that avoid spontaneous breathing. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register (which includes CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, Clinical Trials.gov WHO ICTRP, and medRxiv) and the WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies from their inception to 2 March 2022.  
Selection criteria
Eligible study designs comprised randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated spontaneous breathing in participants with COVID‐19‐related ARDS compared to ventilation strategies that avoided spontaneous breathing (e.g. using NMBA or deep sedation levels). Additionally, we considered controlled before‐after studies, interrupted time series with comparison group, prospective cohort studies and retrospective cohort studies. For these non‐RCT studies, we considered a minimum total number of 50 participants to be compared as necessary for inclusion. Prioritised outcomes were all‐cause mortality, clinical improvement or worsening, quality of life, rate of (serious) adverse events and rate of pneumothorax. Additional outcomes were need for tracheostomy, duration of ICU length of stay and duration of hospitalisation.  
Data collection and analysis
We followed the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. 
Two review authors independently screened all studies at the title/abstract and full‐text screening stage. We also planned to conduct data extraction and risk of bias assessment in duplicate. We planned to conduct meta‐analysis for each prioritised outcome, as well as subgroup analyses of mortality regarding severity of oxygenation impairment and duration of ARDS. In addition, we planned to perform sensitivity analyses for studies at high risk of bias, studies using NMBA in addition to deep sedation level to avoid spontaneous breathing and a comparison of preprints versus peer‐reviewed articles. We planned to assess the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.  
Main results
We identified no eligible studies for this review.
Authors' conclusions
We found no direct evidence on whether early spontaneous breathing in SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced ARDS is beneficial or detrimental to this particular group of patients.  RCTs comparing early spontaneous breathing with ventilatory strategies not allowing for spontaneous breathing in SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced ARDS are necessary to determine its value within the treatment of severely ill people with COVID‐19. Additionally, studies should aim to clarify whether treatment effects differ between people with SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced ARDS and people with non‐SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced ARDS. 
","### **Plain Title**

Is it better to let people with severe COVID-19 breathe on their own while on a breathing machine?

### **Rationale**

Some people who get very sick from COVID-19 have a hard time breathing. This is because the virus can harm the lungs. This serious lung problem is called Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, or ARDS. When this happens, the lungs fill with fluid, and it is very hard to get enough air.

People with ARDS are often treated in a special part of the hospital called the intensive care unit, or ICU. Most of these people need a breathing machine to help them get enough oxygen. A tube is placed in their throat, and the machine pushes air into their lungs.

Doctors are not sure about the best way to use these breathing machines. One way is to let the person try to take some of their own breaths. This is called spontaneous breathing. The other way is to have the machine do all the work. To do this, doctors give strong medicine to make the person deeply asleep and to relax all their muscles.

Letting a person breathe on their own might be good. It could help keep their breathing muscles strong. But it could also have risks. It might cause more harm to the already sick lungs. Because doctors do not know which way is best, this study was done to find out.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a study that involved new patients. Instead, the researchers planned to look for and review all the studies that had already been done on this topic. This is called a systematic review.

The researchers looked for studies that included adults who were in the hospital with ARDS caused by COVID-19. All patients in the studies had to be on a breathing machine.

The goal was to find studies that compared two groups of people:
*   One group who was allowed to take their own breaths while on the machine.
*   Another group who was kept deeply asleep so the machine did all the breathing for them.

The researchers planned to combine the results from all these past studies. They wanted to see which group had better results. They looked for information on how many people lived or died, if they got better or worse, and if they had any side effects. The researchers searched for all studies published up to March 2022.

### **Results**

The researchers looked for all the studies about this topic. After a careful search, they found no studies that matched what they were looking for.

This means there is no direct proof yet to tell us if letting people with COVID-19 ARDS breathe on their own while on a machine is helpful or harmful.

Because they could not find any studies, the researchers could not answer their question. This shows that there is a big gap in what we know about treating this serious illness. The researchers concluded that new studies are urgently needed. These new studies would need to directly compare the two ways of using a breathing machine in very sick patients with COVID-19. This will help doctors learn the best and safest way to care for them.","Spontaneous breathing activity in COVID‐19‐related lung failure
Is early spontaneous breathing beneficial in the treatment of lung failure in individuals with COVID‐19? 
People with severe COVID‐19 can present with lung failure, which is called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This requires invasive mechanical ventilation through a breathing tube. It is possible to allow breathing, triggered by the patient (called spontaneous breathing), whilst being on a ventilator. However, it is unclear whether this is beneficial for such individuals, especially in the early phase of ventilation. 
Key messages 
We found no evidence if spontaneous breathing is beneficial in the treatment of lung failure due to COVID‐19. 
What are the advantages of early spontaneous breathing in ARDS?  
The advantage of spontaneous breathing during mechanical ventilation is the preserved movement of the diaphragm (the major muscle for breathing located under the lungs). It leads to better distribution of the inhaled air, especially in the pulmonary alveoli (small air sacs within the lungs) close to the diaphragm. In general, ventilation procedures with possible spontaneous breathing require lower doses of sedatives (which slow down brain activity). Since these can cause low blood pressure, it can additionally reduce the administration of cardiovascular medicines. 
Can early spontaneous breathing be harmful in the treatment of ARDS? 
During spontaneous breathing under mechanical ventilation, increased pressure fluctuations in the lungs may occur. Increased pressure difference within the lung is the main cause of ventilator‐associated lung injury. 
What is the alternative to using early spontaneous breathing? 
Spontaneous breathing may be suppressed by increased sedation or blockade of the nerves innervating muscles by medicines that allow for breathing (called neuromuscular blockade). The advantage of complete ventilator‐based breathing is a lower oxygen consumption of the muscles and the reduced risk of self‐inflicted lung injury. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of early spontaneous breathing activity in ventilated people with COVID‐19 with ARDS compared to ventilation strategies that avoid spontaneous breathing. 
What did we do?  
We searched for studies that compared early spontaneous breathing during invasive mechanical ventilation with mandatory invasive ventilation and neuromuscular blockade in people with ARDS related to COVID‐19. People could have been any age, sex or ethnicity.  
What did we find?  
After systematic search, we found no records that met the inclusion criteria.
Main results 
We identified no eligible studies for this review.
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
To date, there are no studies that have compared early spontaneous breathing during invasive mechanical ventilation to mandatory invasive ventilation without spontaneous breathing in people with ARDS related to COVID‐19.  
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
Our evidence is up‐to‐date to 2 March 2022.

10.1002-14651858.CD005231.pub3,"Can smokers be helped to reduce the harm caused by cigarette smoking by smoking fewer cigarettes or using different tobacco products? 
Background 
The best thing to do to reduce the harms caused by smoking is to quit, but some people may not want to do this or may feel that they are unable to stop smoking completely. Cutting down the number of cigarettes smoked daily or using different tobacco products, such as chewing tobacco or low‐tar cigarettes, may reduce some of the harm caused by smoking. It may also help people to stop smoking completely in the long term. On the other hand, reducing smoking or using other tobacco products may not improve health and could reduce a person's motivation to quit smoking altogether. It is important that we review the evidence to find out whether these approaches could help smokers who do not want to or cannot quit to reduce the harm caused by their smoking. We were mainly interested in whether these approaches improved the health of smokers, but also looked at smoking reduction and quitting rates. 
Study characteristics 
We found 20 randomised controlled trials that tested ways to help people to cut down the number of cigarettes they smoked. Some of these just advised smokers to smoke less, but most also provided them with a product to help them cut down: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline, bupropion, electronic cigarettes (ecigs), or snus (a form of smokeless, oral tobacco). We also found four randomized controlled trials that tested the effects of using cigarettes designed to reduce the damage caused by smoking: reduced tar, carbon or nicotine cigarettes. Most of the studies used NRT to help people to reduce their smoking. All of the studies included people who were not planning to quit smoking soon. The research is current to October 2015. 
Key results 
Eight studies (with 3081 smokers) found that using NRT roughly doubled the likelihood of halving the number of cigarettes smoked each day, compared to using a placebo. Using NRT in this way also nearly doubled the likelihood of quitting completely. One trial each tested bupropion, varenicline, ecigs and snus to help reduce the harms caused by smoking, and there was no evidence that any of these treatments helped smokers to reduce the number of cigarettes they were smoking each day. This may be because there has not yet been enough research into these methods. Only one of the trials testing cigarettes designed to reduce risk measured their effect on the number of people quitting smoking. It found that people were not more likely to quit smoking if they used reduced‐nicotine cigarettes than if they smoked their usual cigarettes. We did not find any trials which reported the long‐term health effects of the treatments, and so it remains uncertain how much health benefit there is from reducing the number of cigarettes smoked each day or smoking cigarettes designed to be less harmful. 
Quality of evidence 
The tobacco industry funded three of the included studies of cigarettes designed to reduce risk. None of the studies looked at whether there had been a long‐term change in the health of the users. We rate the quality of the evidence looking at how many people quit smoking as 'low' or 'very low', generally because the findings are based on a small number of studies. We need more studies to investigate methods of reducing the harm caused by continued smoking. These need to measure the health of the users over a long period.

Helping Smokers Who Are Not Ready to Quit

### **Rationale**

Smoking cigarettes is very harmful to your health. The best way to protect your health is to quit smoking completely. But we know that quitting can be very hard. Some people may not want to quit, or they may feel that they cannot stop right now.

This study looked for other ways to help these smokers. We wanted to see if we could reduce the harm caused by smoking for people who are not ready to quit. We looked at two main ideas. The first idea was helping people smoke fewer cigarettes each day. The second idea was to have people use tobacco products that might be less harmful, like low-tar cigarettes.

We wanted to find out if these methods could improve a person's health. We also wanted to see if these methods could help a person quit smoking for good in the future.

### **Trial Design**

This was a review of other studies. We did not work with new patients. Instead, our team looked at the results from 24 studies that were already completed. This helps us see what all the research says when we look at it together.

The people in these studies were adults who smoked cigarettes. All of them said that they were not planning to quit smoking soon.

The studies we looked at were designed in a special way to be very fair. People were put into different groups by chance. Some groups got a real treatment to help them smoke less. Other groups got a placebo. A placebo is a ""dummy"" treatment, like a sugar pill, that has no medicine in it. This helps us know if the real treatment worked.

Most of the studies tested products to help people cut down on smoking. These products included nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), like nicotine gum or patches. A few studies also tested e-cigarettes or other medicines. Four of the studies tested special cigarettes designed to be less harmful.

### **Results**

Our main finding was about nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). NRT includes products like nicotine gum, patches, or lozenges. We looked at eight studies with over 3,000 smokers. We found that people who used NRT were about two times more likely to cut the number of cigarettes they smoked in half.

Using NRT also helped people quit smoking completely, even though they were not planning to. People who used NRT were almost two times more likely to stop smoking for good compared to those who used a placebo.

We did not find enough proof that other products, like e-cigarettes or certain medicines, helped people smoke less. This may be because there have not been enough studies done on them yet. We also found that using special low-nicotine cigarettes did not seem to help people quit.

A very important result is what we did not find. None of the studies looked at whether people’s health improved over a long time. Because of this, we still do not know if smoking fewer cigarettes really makes you healthier in the long run. Our trust in the results is low because they are based on a small number of studies. We need more research to know for sure how to help people who are not ready to quit.","Can smokers be helped to reduce the harm caused by cigarette smoking by smoking fewer cigarettes or using different tobacco products?

Health services have traditionally been developed to focus on specific diseases or medical specialties. Involving consumers as partners in planning, delivering and evaluating health services may lead to services that are person‐centred and so better able to meet the needs of and provide care for individuals. Globally, governments recommend consumer involvement in healthcare decision‐making at the systems level, as a strategy for promoting person‐centred health services. However, the effects of this 'working in partnership' approach to healthcare decision‐making are unclear. Working in partnership is defined here as collaborative relationships between at least one consumer and health provider, meeting jointly and regularly in formal group formats, to equally contribute to and collaborate on health service‐related decision‐making in real time. In this review, the terms 'consumer' and 'health provider' refer to partnership participants, and 'health service user' and 'health service provider' refer to trial participants. 
This review of effects of partnership interventions was undertaken concurrently with a Cochrane Qualitative Evidence Synthesis (QES) entitled Consumers and health providers working in partnership for the promotion of person‐centred health services: a co‐produced qualitative evidence synthesis. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of consumers and health providers working in partnership, as an intervention to promote person‐centred health services. 
Search methods
We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases from 2000 to April 2019; PROQUEST Dissertations and Theses Global from 2016 to April 2019; and grey literature and online trial registries from 2000 until September 2019. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, and cluster‐RCTs of ‘working in partnership’ interventions meeting these three criteria: both consumer and provider participants meet; they meet jointly and regularly in formal group formats; and they make actual decisions that relate to the person‐centredness of health service(s). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened most titles and abstracts. One review author screened a subset of titles and abstracts (i.e. those identified through clinical trials registries searches, those classified by the Cochrane RCT Classifier as unlikely to be an RCT, and those identified through other sources). Two review authors independently screened all full texts of potentially eligible articles for inclusion. In case of disagreement, they consulted a third review author to reach consensus. One review author extracted data and assessed risk of bias for all included studies and a second review author independently cross‐checked all data and assessments. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion, or by consulting a third review author to reach consensus. Meta‐analysis was not possible due to the small number of included trials and their heterogeneity; we synthesised results descriptively by comparison and outcome. We reported the following outcomes in GRADE ‘Summary of findings’ tables: health service alterations; the degree to which changed service reflects health service user priorities; health service users' ratings of health service performance; health service users' health service utilisation patterns; resources associated with the decision‐making process; resources associated with implementing decisions; and adverse events. 
Main results
We included five trials (one RCT and four cluster‐RCTs), with 16,257 health service users and more than 469 health service providers as trial participants. For two trials, the aims of the partnerships were to directly improve the person‐centredness of health services (via health service planning, and discharge co‐ordination). In the remaining trials, the aims were indirect (training first‐year medical doctors on patient safety) or broader in focus (which could include person‐centredness of health services that targeted the public/community, households or health service delivery to improve maternal and neonatal mortality). Three trials were conducted in high income‐countries, one was in a middle‐income country and one was in a low‐income country. Two studies evaluated working in partnership interventions, compared to usual practice without partnership (Comparison 1); and three studies evaluated working in partnership as part of a multi‐component intervention, compared to the same intervention without partnership (Comparison 2). No studies evaluated one form of working in partnership compared to another (Comparison 3). 
The effects of consumers and health providers working in partnership compared to usual practice without partnership are uncertain: only one of the two studies that assessed this comparison measured health service alteration outcomes, and data were not usable, as only intervention group data were reported. Additionally, none of the included studies evaluating this comparison measured the other primary or secondary outcomes we sought for the 'Summary of findings' table. 
We are also unsure about the effects of consumers and health providers working in partnership as part of a multi‐component intervention compared to the same intervention without partnership. Very low‐certainty evidence indicated there may be little or no difference on health service alterations or health service user health service performance ratings (two studies); or on health service user health service utilisation patterns and adverse events (one study each). No studies evaluating this comparison reported the degree to which health service alterations reflect health service user priorities, or resource use. 
Overall, our confidence in the findings about the effects of working in partnership interventions was very low due to indirectness, imprecision and publication bias, and serious concerns about risk of selection bias; performance bias, detection bias and reporting bias in most studies. 
Authors' conclusions
The effects of consumers and providers working in partnership as an intervention, or as part of a multi‐component intervention, are uncertain, due to a lack of high‐quality evidence and/or due to a lack of studies. Further well‐designed RCTs with a clear focus on assessing outcomes directly related to partnerships for patient‐centred health services are needed in this area, which may also benefit from mixed‐methods and qualitative research to build the evidence base.

Do Health Services Get Better When Patients and Doctors Plan Them Together? A Review of the Research

### **Rationale**

Healthcare is often set up to treat one specific disease at a time. This can make it hard to care for a person's overall needs. A new idea is to have healthcare focus more on the whole person. This is called person-centered care.

One way to do this is to have patients and healthcare workers, like doctors and nurses, work together as a team. In this team, they meet regularly to plan and make decisions about health services. The hope is that this teamwork will create services that better meet the real needs of patients.

Many governments suggest this team approach. But we do not know for sure if it really works. This study was done to see if having patients and doctors work together in this way truly makes health services better for people.

### **Trial Design**

This was a review study. This means the researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they looked for and studied the results of other studies that had already been finished.

The researchers looked for studies that met three main rules:
1.  Both patients and healthcare workers were in the group.
2.  The group met together at set times.
3.  The group made real decisions about how to make health services more focused on people.

After a wide search, the researchers found 5 studies that fit these rules. These studies took place in different countries, from rich to poor. In total, the studies included over 16,000 people who used health services and more than 400 healthcare workers. The studies that were reviewed were all done between the year 2000 and 2019.

### **Results**

The main result of this review is that we are still not sure if having patients and doctors work together improves health services.

There was not enough good information to make a strong conclusion. The 5 studies that were found had some problems in how they were designed. This made the researchers feel that the results were not very trustworthy.

Some of the studies compared teamwork to the usual way of doing things. Other studies looked at teamwork as one part of a bigger health program. In both cases, the results were not clear.

*   The studies showed there may be little or no difference in how health services changed when patients and doctors worked together.
*   There was also little or no difference in how patients rated their care.
*   The review could not find any information on whether the changes made were what patients actually wanted or needed.

The researchers who did this review concluded that we cannot say for sure if this team approach works. This is because there are not enough good quality studies on this topic. They believe that more and better studies are needed. Future studies could help us find out if patients and doctors planning health services together is a good way to improve care for everyone.","When healthcare consumers (patients, carers and family members) and healthcare providers work together as partners to plan, deliver and evaluate health services, what effects does this have? 
What are person‐centred health services? 
Traditionally, health services have been developed by healthcare providers and focus on specific diseases or medical specialties. Involving consumers as partners in planning, delivering and evaluating health services may lead to services that are better able to meet the needs of and provide care for individuals.  
Why we did this Cochrane review 
Governments worldwide recommend that healthcare providers work with consumers to promote person‐centred health services. However, the effects of healthcare providers and consumers working together are unclear. 
We reviewed the evidence from research studies to find out about the effects of healthcare providers and consumers working together to plan, deliver and evaluate health services. 
Specifically, we wanted to know if consumers and healthcare providers working together in partnership – in the form of regular meetings in which consumers and providers were invited to contribute as equals to decisions about health services – had an impact on: 
‐ changes to health services;
‐ the extent to which changes to health services reflected service users’ priorities;
‐ users’ ratings of health services;
‐ health service use; and
‐ time and money needed to make or act on decisions about health services.
We also wanted to find out if there were any unwanted (adverse) effects.    
What did we do? 
First, we searched the medical literature for studies that compared:
‐ consumers and healthcare providers working in partnership against usual practice or other strategies with no partnership; or 
‐ different ways of working in partnership (for example, with fewer or more consumers, or with online or face‐to‐face meetings). 
We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. 
What did we find? 
We found five studies that involved a total of 16,257 health service users and more than 469 health service providers. Three studies took place in high income‐countries and one each in middle‐ and low‐income countries. 
The studies compared:
‐ working in partnership against usual practice without partnership working (2 studies); and 
‐ working in partnership as part of a wider strategy to promote person‐centred health services, against the same wider strategy without partnership working (3 studies).   
No studies evaluated one form of working in partnership compared to another.
What are the main results of our review? 
The studies provided insufficient evidence to determine if working in partnership had any effects compared to usual practice or wider strategies with no working in partnership. 
No studies investigated:
‐ impacts on the extent to which changes to health services reflected service users’ priorities, or 
‐ the resources needed to make or act on decisions about health services.
Few studies investigated:
‐ impacts on changes to health services;
‐ users’ ratings of health services;
‐ health service use; and
‐ adverse events.
The few studies that did investigate these outcomes either did not report usable information or produced findings in which we have very little confidence. These studies were small, used methods likely to introduce errors in their results and focused on specific settings or populations. Their results are unlikely to reflect the results of all the studies that have been conducted in this area, some of which have not made their results public yet. 
What does this mean? 
There is not enough robust evidence to determine the effects of consumers and providers working in partnership to plan, deliver or evaluate health services. 
This review highlights the need for well‐designed studies with a clear focus on evaluating the effects of partnerships for promoting person‐centred care in health services. This area of research may also benefit from studies that investigate why certain partnerships between consumers and healthcare providers may be more successful than others, and an accompanying qualitative evidence synthesis addressing this aspect is forthcoming.

10.1002-14651858.CD013876.pub3,"Background
Olfactory dysfunction is a common consequence of COVID‐19 infection and persistent symptoms can have a profound impact on quality of life. At present there is little guidance on how best to treat this condition. A variety of interventions have been suggested to promote recovery, including medication and olfactory training. However, it is uncertain whether any intervention is of benefit. This is an update of the 2021 review with one additional study added.  
Objectives
1) To evaluate the benefits and harms of any intervention versus no treatment for people with persisting olfactory dysfunction due to COVID‐19 infection.  
2) To keep the evidence up‐to‐date, using a living systematic review approach. 
Search methods
The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the latest search was 20 October 2021.   
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people with COVID‐19 related olfactory disturbance that had persisted for at least four weeks. We included any intervention compared to no treatment or placebo.  
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were the recovery of sense of smell, disease‐related quality of life and serious adverse effects. Secondary outcomes were the change in sense of smell, general quality of life, prevalence of parosmia and other adverse effects (including nosebleeds/bloody discharge). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. 
Main results
We included two studies with 30 participants. The studies evaluated the following interventions: systemic corticosteroids plus intranasal corticosteroid/mucolytic/decongestant and palmitoylethanolamide plus luteolin.  
Systemic corticosteroids plus intranasal corticosteroid/mucolytic/decongestant compared to no intervention  
We included a single RCT with 18 participants who had anosmia for at least 30 days following COVID‐19 infection. Participants received a 15‐day course of oral corticosteroids combined with nasal irrigation (consisting of an intranasal corticosteroid/mucolytic/decongestant solution) or no intervention. Psychophysical testing was used to assess olfactory function at 40 days. This is a single, small study and for all outcomes the certainty of evidence was very low. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. 
Palmitoylethanolamide plus luteolin compared to no intervention  
We included a single RCT with 12 participants who had anosmia or hyposmia for at least 90 days following COVID‐19 infection. Participants received a 30‐day course of palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin or no intervention. Psychophysical testing was used to assess olfactory function at 30 days. This is a single, small study and for all outcomes the certainty of evidence was very low. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. 
Authors' conclusions
There is very limited evidence available on the efficacy and harms of treatments for persistent olfactory dysfunction following COVID‐19 infection. However, we have identified a number of ongoing trials in this area. As this is a living systematic review we will update the data regularly, as new results become available.

Do Treatments for Smell Loss from COVID-19 Work? A Look at the Research.

### **Rationale**
**What is the problem?**
Many people who get sick with COVID-19 lose their sense of smell. For some people, their sense of smell comes back quickly. But for others, the problem can last for a long time.

Losing your sense of smell can make your life hard. Food might not taste good anymore. You may not be able to smell things you enjoy, like flowers or coffee. It can also be unsafe if you cannot smell dangers like smoke from a fire or spoiled food. This can make people feel sad and lonely.

**Why did we do this study?**
Right now, doctors are not sure what the best way is to treat long-lasting smell loss from COVID-19. Some people have tried things like smell training or different types of medicines. But we do not have enough proof to know if these treatments work well or if they are safe.

This study aimed to find all the best research on this topic. We wanted to look at the results of other studies. Our goal was to see if any treatments helped people get their sense of smell back. We also looked for any bad side effects from these treatments. Finding a safe and helpful treatment is very important for people with this condition.

### **Trial Design**
**How was this study designed?**
This was not a study where we gave a new medicine to patients. Instead, we did a ""systematic review."" This means we looked for and reviewed all the best studies that had already been done on this topic. By putting the results of other studies together, we hoped to find a clear answer.

This is also a ""living"" review. A living review means we will keep updating it. As new studies are finished, we will add their results to ours. This helps keep our information as new as possible.

We looked for a special type of study called a ""randomized controlled trial."" This is the best type of study to see if a treatment really works. In these studies, some people get the real treatment. Other people get a fake treatment or no treatment at all. Then, scientists compare the two groups.

The studies we looked for had to include adults who had smell loss for at least four weeks after having COVID-19.

### **Results**
**What were the main results of the study?**
We searched for all the studies we could find. We found only two small studies that met our rules. In total, these two studies only had 30 people. Because the studies were so small, it is hard to be sure about their results.

The first study looked at 18 people. Some of them took steroid pills and used a special nose spray for 15 days. The other people in the study got no treatment. After 40 days, the researchers tested everyone's sense of smell.

The second study looked at 12 people. Some of them took a type of supplement for 30 days. The others in this study got no treatment. After 30 days, the researchers tested their sense of smell.

**What does this mean for patients?**
Based on these two very small studies, we cannot say if these treatments work. The proof was not strong enough to make a decision. We do not have enough information to know if the treatments helped people get their sense of smell back. We also do not know if these treatments caused any bad side effects.

So, we still do not know the best way to treat long-lasting smell loss from COVID-19. We need more and bigger studies to find a good answer. The good news is that we know more studies are happening now. As soon as they are done, we will add their results to our review. We hope to have a better answer for patients in the future.","Interventions for the treatment of persistent smell disorders (olfactory dysfunction) after COVID‐19 infection 
Why this is important 
The sense of smell is critical to one's enjoyment of odours and tastes, and is important for safety. During the COVID‐19 pandemic there has been an increasing focus on change in sense of smell as one of the early symptoms associated with infection. This can be a reduction, change or complete loss of the sense of smell. For most people this is temporary, however for some this lasts weeks or even months. If a person has lost their sense of smell for a long time (over four weeks after having COVID‐19), we do not know if there are any treatments that might help it to recover.  
How we identified and assessed the evidence 
We searched the medical literature, identifying relevant studies and summarising the results. We assessed the quality of the studies as well as the certainty of the evidence. Factors influencing this included the size of the studies, the methods used to perform them and how results were reported by researchers. Based on this, we classed the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. 
What we found 
We found two small studies to include in the review, including a total of 30 people. All participants had problems with their sense of smell that had lasted for at least four weeks, and started after a COVID‐19 infection. Problems with the sense of smell were identified using special smell identification tests carried out by the research team. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: those who would receive treatment and those who would not.  
The treatment in one study was a course of corticosteroid tablets ('systemic') and nasal irrigation (with a wash consisting of a mix of corticosteroids, decongestant and an agent that breaks down mucus). The second study used a course of a supplement known as palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin.  
Systemic corticosteroids and nasal irrigation (intranasal corticosteroids/decongestant/mucolytic) compared to no treatment 
We do not know whether corticosteroid tablets with nasal irrigation is better or worse than no treatment at: 
 ‐ restoring the sense of smell back to normal after 40 days; ‐ changing the sense of smell after 40 days; ‐ causing any unwanted side effects. 
This is because the evidence that we found was of very low certainty, mainly due to the fact that only one study was identified and it included a small number of patients. 
Palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin compared to no treatment 
We do not know whether palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin is better or worse than no treatment at: 
 ‐ restoring the sense of smell back to normal after 30 days; ‐ changing the sense of smell after 30 days; ‐ causing any unwanted side effects. 
This is because the evidence that we found was of very low certainty, mainly due to the fact that only one study was identified and it included a small number of patients. 
We did find a number of other studies that are being carried out, but no results from these studies are yet available to be included in this review. 
What this means 
It is unclear whether using corticosteroids with nasal irrigation, or using a palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin supplement, might treat problems with the sense of smell after COVID‐19, or whether these treatments can potentially cause harm. 
Other treatments are under investigation. This review is a 'living systematic review', meaning that we will keep checking for new studies that might be relevant, and the review will be continually updated when any extra results are available. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to October 2021.
"
10.1002-14651858.CD013397.pub2,"Background
Leg ulcers are open skin wounds on the lower leg that can last weeks, months or even years. Most leg ulcers are the result of venous diseases. First‐line treatment options often include the use of compression bandages or stockings. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of using compression bandages or stockings, compared with no compression, on the healing of venous leg ulcers in any setting and population. 
Search methods
In June 2020 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations), Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions by language, date of publication or study setting. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials that compared any types of compression bandages or stockings with no compression in participants with venous leg ulcers in any setting. 
Data collection and analysis
At least two review authors independently assessed studies using predetermined inclusion criteria. We carried out data extraction, and risk‐of‐bias assessment using the Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool. We assessed the certainty of the evidence according to GRADE methodology. 
Main results
We included 14 studies (1391 participants) in the review. Most studies were small (median study sample size: 51 participants). Participants were recruited from acute‐care settings, outpatient settings and community settings, and a large proportion (65.9%; 917/1391) of participants had a confirmed history or clinical evidence of chronic venous disease, a confirmed cause of chronic venous insufficiency, or an ankle pressure/brachial pressure ratio of greater than 0.8 or 0.9. The average age of participants ranged from 58.0 to 76.5 years (median: 70.1 years). The average duration of their leg ulcers ranged from 9.0 weeks to 31.6 months (median: 22.0 months), and a large proportion of participants (64.8%; 901/1391) had ulcers with an area between 5 and 20 cm2. Studies had a median follow‐up of 12 weeks. Compression bandages or stockings applied included short‐stretch bandage, four‐layer compression bandage, and Unna's boot (a type of inelastic gauze bandage impregnated with zinc oxide), and comparator groups used included 'usual care', pharmacological treatment, a variety of dressings, and a variety of treatments where some participants received compression (but it was not the norm). Of the 14 included studies, 10 (71.4%) presented findings which we consider to be at high overall risk of bias. 
Primary outcomes 
There is moderate‐certainty evidence (downgraded once for risk of bias) (1) that there is probably a shorter time to complete healing of venous leg ulcers in people wearing compression bandages or stockings compared with those not wearing compression (pooled hazard ratio for time‐to‐complete healing 2.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.52 to 3.10; I2 = 59%; 5 studies, 733 participants); and (2) that people treated using compression bandages or stockings are more likely to experience complete ulcer healing within 12 months compared with people with no compression (10 studies, 1215 participants): risk ratio for complete healing 1.77, 95% CI 1.41 to 2.21; I2 = 65% (8 studies with analysable data, 1120 participants); synthesis without meta‐analysis suggests more completely‐healed ulcers in compression bandages or stockings than in no compression (2 studies without analysable data, 95 participants). 
It is uncertain whether there is any difference in rates of adverse events between using compression bandages or stockings and no compression (very low‐certainty evidence; 3 studies, 585 participants). 
Secondary outcomes 
Moderate‐certainty evidence suggests that people using compression bandages or stockings probably have a lower mean pain score than those not using compression (four studies with 859 participants and another study with 69 ulcers): pooled mean difference −1.39, 95% CI −1.79 to −0.98; I2 = 65% (two studies with 426 participants and another study with 69 ulcers having analysable data); synthesis without meta‐analysis suggests a reduction in leg ulcer pain in compression bandages or stockings, compared with no compression (two studies without analysable data, 433 participants). Compression bandages or stockings versus no compression may improve disease‐specific quality of life, but not all aspects of general health status during the follow‐up of 12 weeks to 12 months (four studies with 859 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
It is uncertain if the use of compression bandages or stockings is more cost‐effective than not using them (three studies with 486 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
If using compression bandages or stockings, people with venous leg ulcers probably experience complete wound healing more quickly, and more people have wounds completely healed. The use of compression bandages or stockings probably reduces pain and may improve disease‐specific quality of life. There is uncertainty about adverse effects, and cost effectiveness. 
Future research should focus on comparing alternative bandages and stockings with the primary endpoint of time to complete wound healing alongside adverse events including pain score, and health‐related quality of life, and should incorporate cost‐effectiveness analysis where possible. Future studies should adhere to international standards of trial conduct and reporting.

Do Special Wraps and Stockings Help Heal Leg Sores from Vein Problems?

### **Rationale**

**What are venous leg ulcers?**
Some people get open sores on their lower legs that are hard to heal. These are called leg ulcers. They can last for many weeks, months, or even years. These sores can be a serious health problem.

**Why do these leg sores happen?**
Our legs have veins that carry blood back up to the heart. Inside the veins are tiny one-way doors, called valves. These valves keep blood from flowing backward. Sometimes, these valves get weak or damaged. This is called venous disease.

When the valves don't work right, blood can pool in the lower legs. This creates high pressure in the veins. Over time, this pressure can damage the skin and cause a painful sore to form.

**How do these sores affect people’s lives?**
Living with a leg sore can be very hard. The sores can be painful. They can leak fluid, which can have an odor. This can make it hard to walk, sleep, or leave the house. People with these sores may feel sad or worried. Finding a treatment that works is very important.

**How might special wraps and stockings help?**
A common treatment for these sores is to use special tight bandages or stockings. This is called compression therapy. The wrap or stocking gently squeezes the leg. This squeeze helps the weak veins push the old blood back up towards the heart. This can lower the pressure in the leg. This may help the sore heal and reduce pain.

**Why was this study needed?**
Many small studies have looked at compression therapy. But their results can be hard to understand all at once. Researchers wanted to get a clear answer. They decided to bring together the results from all the best studies. This kind of review gives a stronger, more trusted answer about whether a treatment works.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**
This was not a new study with its own patients. Instead, researchers looked for all the studies on this topic that had already been done. This is called a review. The researchers carefully searched for studies from all over the world. They only included studies that were designed in a specific way.

**What kind of studies did they look for?**
The researchers only included studies called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, patients are put into groups by chance, like flipping a coin. One group gets the treatment being tested. The other group does not. This is the best way to fairly compare treatments. In these studies, one group used compression wraps or stockings. The other group got different care but no compression.

**Who was in the studies?**
The review looked at 14 different studies. In total, there were about 1,400 people in these studies. Most of the people were older adults. Their average age was about 70 years old.

**What were their health problems?**
All of the people in the studies had leg sores caused by vein problems. Many of them had their sores for a very long time. For half the people, their sores had been open for almost two years.

**How long did the studies last?**
The studies that were reviewed followed patients for a period of time to see what happened. The average time that patients were watched in the studies was about three months.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**
The review found that compression therapy helps people with leg sores. The most important findings were about healing, pain, and quality of life.

**Did the sores heal faster?**
Yes. People who used compression wraps or stockings had their sores heal more quickly than people who did not use compression. The researchers are pretty sure about this result.

**Did more sores heal completely?**
Yes. More people who used compression had their sores heal up all the way. People using compression were much more likely to have their ulcer heal completely within a year compared to those not using it. The researchers are also pretty sure about this result.

**Did compression help with pain?**
Yes. The review found that people who used compression had less pain from their leg sores. This is another important benefit for patients.

**What about side effects or other problems?**
The researchers were not sure if there was any difference in side effects. The studies did not have enough clear information to say if compression was more or less safe than other types of care. Because of this, we cannot be sure about the risks.

**Was the treatment worth the cost?**
The researchers were also not sure if using compression was worth the money. There was not enough information in the studies to know if it saved money in the long run.

**What was the final conclusion?**
The authors of the review concluded that compression therapy is a good treatment for leg sores caused by vein problems. It helps sores heal faster and more completely. It also helps reduce pain for patients. More good research is needed to better understand the side effects and the cost of the treatment.","Compression bandages or stockings versus no compression for treating venous leg ulcers
Key messages 
Compared with not using compression, compression therapy that uses bandages or stockings to treat venous leg ulcers: 
‐ probably heals venous leg ulcers more quickly;
‐ probably increases the number of people whose ulcer has completely healed after 12 months; 
‐ probably reduces pain; and
‐ may improve some aspects of people’s quality of life.
However, there is still uncertainty about whether or not compression therapy causes unwanted side effects, and if the health benefits of using compression outweigh its cost. 
What are leg ulcers? 
Leg ulcers are open skin wounds on the lower leg that can last weeks, months or even years. Most leg ulcers are caused by venous diseases that affect the circulation of blood in leg veins. Venous leg ulcers can cause distress and pain to patients, and can be very costly to the health service. 
What did we want to find out? 
Standard treatment options for venous leg ulcers often include compression therapy. This involves applying external pressure around the lower leg to help the return of blood from the legs to the heart. Compression therapy uses bandages, stockings or other devices. 
We wanted to find out if compression therapy delivered by bandages and stockings compared with no compression: 
‐ heals venous leg ulcers;
‐ has any unwanted effects;
‐ improves people’s quality of life;
‐ has health benefits that outweigh the costs (cost‐effectiveness); and
‐ reduces pain.
What did we do? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where the treatment or care people receive is chosen at random). This type of study design provides the most reliable health evidence about the effects of a treatment. We searched for studies that evaluated the effects of any types of compression bandages or stockings compared with no compression in people affected with venous leg ulcers in any care setting. We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found 14 studies (1391 people, average age: 70.1 years) that lasted on average for 12 weeks. People in eight of the 14 studies were treated in outpatient and community settings. People had venous leg ulcers that had lasted for 22 months on average, and most ulcers had an area between 5 and 20 cm2. 
The studies used three types of compression therapy: short‐stretch bandage, four‐layer compression bandage, and Unna's boot (a type of compression bandage containing zinc oxide). These therapies were compared with no compression in forms of 'usual care', pharmacological treatment, a variety of dressings, and a variety of treatments where only some participants received compression (but it was not the norm). 
(1) Venous leg‐ulcer healing and unwanted effects  
Compared with no compression, the evidence suggests that:
‐ people wearing compression bandages or stockings probably experience complete ulcer healing more quickly; and 
‐ more people treated using the compression bandages or stockings are likely to experience complete ulcer healing within 12 months. 
However, we did not find clear evidence to tell if using compression bandages or stockings causes any unwanted effects. 
(2) Other effects  
The evidence suggests that, compared with not using compression, the use of compression bandages or stockings: 
‐ probably reduces pain more than not using compression; and
‐ may improve some aspects of people’s quality of life in 12 weeks to 12 months.
However, we are uncertain if the use of compression bandages or stockings results in health benefits that outweigh their costs. 
What limited our confidence in the evidence? 
Most studies were small (51 people on average) and 10 of the 14 included studies used methods that could introduce errors in their results. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to June 2020.

10.1002-14651858.MR000006.pub3,"Background
The tendency for authors to submit, and of journals to accept, manuscripts for publication based on the direction or strength of the study findings has been termed publication bias. 
Objectives
To assess the extent to which publication of a cohort of clinical trials is influenced by the statistical significance, perceived importance, or direction of their results. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Methodology Register (The Cochrane Library [Online] Issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE (1950 to March Week 2 2007), EMBASE (1980 to Week 11 2007) and Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations (March 21 2007). We also searched the Science Citation Index (April 2007), checked reference lists of relevant articles and contacted researchers to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
Studies containing analyses of the association between publication and the statistical significance or direction of the results (trial findings), for a cohort of registered clinical trials. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently extracted data. We classified findings as either positive (defined as results classified by the investigators as statistically significant (P < 0.05), or perceived as striking or important, or showing a positive direction of effect) or negative (findings that were not statistically significant (P ≥ 0.05), or perceived as unimportant, or showing a negative or null direction in effect). We extracted information on other potential risk factors for failure to publish, when these data were available. 
Main results
Five studies were included. Trials with positive findings were more likely to be published than trials with negative or null findings (odds ratio 3.90; 95% confidence interval 2.68 to 5.68). This corresponds to a risk ratio of 1.78 (95% CI 1.58 to 1.95), assuming that 41% of negative trials are published (the median among the included studies, range = 11% to 85%). In absolute terms, this means that if 41% of negative trials are published, we would expect that 73% of positive trials would be published. 
Two studies assessed time to publication and showed that trials with positive findings tended to be published after four to five years compared to those with negative findings, which were published after six to eight years. Three studies found no statistically significant association between sample size and publication. One study found no significant association between either funding mechanism, investigator rank, or sex and publication. 
Authors' conclusions
Trials with positive findings are published more often, and more quickly, than trials with negative findings.

Are All Medical Study Results Shared with the Public?

**Rationale**
Doctors and patients need information to make good health choices. A lot of this information comes from medical studies, also called clinical trials. These studies test new medicines or treatments to see if they are safe and if they work. After a study is done, researchers write a report with the results. They send this report to a medical journal to be shared with doctors and other researchers around the world.

But what if only some of these study results get shared? Some people worried that studies showing ""good news"" were more likely to be published. ""Good news"" means a new treatment worked well. Studies showing ""bad news"" or ""no news"" might not get published. This could mean a new treatment did not work, or the results were unclear.

This is a problem. If doctors only see the studies with good news, they might think a treatment works better than it really does. Patients might not get all the facts about their treatment options. Researchers in this study wanted to find out if this problem was real. They wanted to see if studies with good news are published more often than studies with bad news or no news.

**Trial Design**
This was a study of other studies. The researchers did not work with patients directly. Instead, they searched for previous research that had already looked into this problem.

They looked for studies that had followed a large group of clinical trials over many years. These studies tracked each trial from its beginning. They recorded what the results of each trial were. Then, they checked to see if the trial results were ever published in a medical journal.

The researchers found 5 of these large studies to include in their own report. They combined the information from all 5 studies. They sorted the results of each original trial into two simple groups:
*   **Positive results:** This meant the treatment in the study seemed to work.
*   **Negative results:** This meant the treatment did not seem to work, or the results were unclear.

By looking at these groups, the researchers could compare how many trials from each group were published.

**Results**
The study found that trials with positive results were much more likely to be published than trials with negative results. The difference was very large. The researchers found that if about 4 out of 10 studies with negative results get published, then about 7 out of 10 studies with positive results get published. This means many studies with negative results are never shared with the public.

The researchers also looked at how long it took for results to be published. They found that studies with positive results were published much faster. It took about 4 to 5 years for a study with positive results to be published. For a study with negative results, it took longer, about 6 to 8 years.

The researchers also checked if other things affected whether a study was published. For example, they looked at the number of people in a trial. They found that this did not seem to make a difference. Who paid for the study also did not seem to matter. The main reason was whether the results were positive or negative.

The conclusion from the researchers is clear. The full story from medical research is not always being told. Studies with good news are shared more often and more quickly. This can give a misleading picture of how well a treatment works. It is important for doctors and patients to have all the information, both good and bad, to make the best health decisions.","Publication bias in clinical trials due to statistical significance or direction of trial results 
The validity of a systematic review depends on the methods used to conduct the review. If there is a systematic bias, such that studies with statistically significant or positive findings are more likely to be published and included in systematic reviews than trials with non‐significant findings, then the validity of a review's conclusions can be threatened. 
This methodology review identified five studies that investigated the extent to which the publication of clinical trials (such as those approved by an ethics review board) is influenced by the statistical significance or direction of a trial's results. These studies showed that trials with positive findings (defined either as those that were statistically significant (P < 0.05), or those findings perceived to be important or striking, or those indicating a positive direction of treatment effect), had nearly four times the odds of being published compared to findings that were not statistically significant (P ≥ 0.05), or perceived as unimportant, or showing a negative or null direction of treatment effect. This corresponds to a risk ratio of 1.78 (95% CI 1.58 to 1.95), assuming that 41% of negative trials are published.Two studies found that trials with positive findings also tended to be published more quickly than trials with negative findings. The size of the trial (assessed in three studies) and the source of funding, academic rank, and sex of the principal investigator (assessed in one study) did not appear to influence whether a trial was published. 
These results provide support for mandating that clinical trials are registered before recruiting participants so that review authors know about all potentially eligible studies, regardless of their findings. Those carrying out systematic reviews should ensure they assess the potential problems of publication bias in their review and consider methods for addressing this issue by ensuring a comprehensive search for both published and unpublished trials.

Previous research on animal and physiological models suggests that antioxidant supplements have beneficial effects that may prolong life. Some observational studies also suggest that antioxidant supplements may prolong life, whereas other observational studies demonstrate neutral or harmful effects. Our Cochrane review from 2008 demonstrated that antioxidant supplements seem to increase mortality. This review is now updated. 
The present systematic review included 78 randomised clinical trials. In total, 296,707 participants were randomised to antioxidant supplements (beta‐carotene, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium) versus placebo or no intervention. Twenty‐six trials included 215,900 healthy participants. Fifty‐two trials included 80,807 participants with various diseases in a stable phase (including gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, neurological, ocular, dermatological, rheumatoid, renal, endocrinological, or unspecified diseases). A total of 21,484 of 183,749 participants (11.7%) randomised to antioxidant supplements and 11,479 of 112,958 participants (10.2%) randomised to placebo or no intervention died. The trials appeared to have enough statistical similarity that they could be combined. When all of the trials were combined, antioxidants may or may not have increased mortality depending on which statistical combination method was employed; the analysis that is typically used when similarity is present demonstrated that antioxidant use did slightly increase mortality (that is, the patients consuming the antioxidants were 1.03 times as likely to die as were the controls). When analyses were done to identify factors that were associated with this finding, the two factors identified were better methodology to prevent bias from being a factor in the trial (trials with ‘low risk of bias’) and the use of vitamin A. In fact, when the trials with low risks of bias were considered separately, the increased mortality was even more pronounced (1.04 times as likely to die as were the controls). The potential damage from vitamin A disappeared when only the low risks of bias trials were considered. The increased risk of mortality was associated with beta‐carotene and possibly vitamin E and vitamin A, but was not associated with the use of vitamin C or selenium. The current evidence does not support the use of antioxidant supplements in the general population or in patients with various diseases.

Do Vitamin Pills Help You Live Longer? A Look at the Research

**Rationale**
Our bodies have things called antioxidants. They work to protect our body’s cells from damage. Many people believe that taking extra antioxidants as pills can keep them healthy and help them live longer. These pills are often called antioxidant supplements. Common ones include beta-carotene and vitamins A, C, and E.

Some early studies on animals showed that these pills might be helpful. A few studies with people also suggested they could help. But other studies found that these pills had no effect, or that they could even be harmful.

Because the results were not clear, researchers wanted to find a better answer. A big review of studies in 2008 suggested that these pills might actually increase the risk of dying. This new, larger review was done to update that work. The goal was to combine all the best research to see if taking antioxidant pills is truly safe and helps people live longer.

**Trial Design**
This was a very large review. The researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they gathered the results from 78 different studies that were already completed. Looking at many studies together can give a much stronger and more reliable answer.

The studies included in this review were high-quality. They were all “randomized clinical trials.” This means that in each study, people were put into groups purely by chance, like flipping a coin. One group took antioxidant supplement pills. The other group took a dummy pill, also called a placebo. A placebo looks like the real pill but has no medicine in it. Some studies compared the pills to getting no pill at all.

These 78 studies included a huge number of people. In total, almost 300,000 adults were part of the research. Some of these people were healthy. Others had different long-term diseases, like heart, kidney, or stomach problems. The studies looked at several different antioxidant pills: beta-carotene, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium.

**Results**
After looking at all the information from the 78 studies, the researchers found that taking antioxidant pills did not help people live longer.

The results showed a small increase in the risk of death for people who took antioxidant supplements. For every 100 people who died in the group not taking the pills, about 103 people died in the group taking the pills. This increased risk was seen most clearly in the studies that were designed the best, which makes the finding more trustworthy.

The researchers also looked at each antioxidant separately. They found the increased risk of death was linked to taking beta-carotene, and possibly vitamin E and vitamin A. Taking vitamin C or selenium did not seem to increase the risk of death.

Based on all this strong evidence, the researchers made a clear conclusion. The proof does not support using antioxidant pills to try and live longer. This is true for healthy people and for people who already have a disease. Taking these supplements is not helpful for preventing death and could be slightly harmful.","Antioxidant supplements for prevention of mortality in healthy participants and patients with various diseases

Smoking is a leading cause of disease and death worldwide. In people who smoke, quitting smoking can reverse much of the damage. Many people use behavioural interventions to help them quit smoking; these interventions can vary substantially in their content and effectiveness. 
Objectives
To summarise the evidence from Cochrane Reviews that assessed the effect of behavioural interventions designed to support smoking cessation attempts and to conduct a network meta‐analysis to determine how modes of delivery; person delivering the intervention; and the nature, focus, and intensity of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation influence the likelihood of achieving abstinence six months after attempting to stop smoking; and whether the effects of behavioural interventions depend upon other characteristics, including population, setting, and the provision of pharmacotherapy. 
To summarise the availability and principal findings of economic evaluations of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation, in terms of comparative costs and cost‐effectiveness, in the form of a brief economic commentary. 
Methods
This work comprises two main elements. 1. We conducted a Cochrane Overview of reviews following standard Cochrane methods. We identified Cochrane Reviews of behavioural interventions (including all non‐pharmacological interventions, e.g. counselling, exercise, hypnotherapy, self‐help materials) for smoking cessation by searching the Cochrane Library in July 2020. We evaluated the methodological quality of reviews using AMSTAR 2 and synthesised data from the reviews narratively. 2. We used the included reviews to identify randomised controlled trials of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation compared with other behavioural interventions or no intervention for smoking cessation. To be included, studies had to include adult smokers and measure smoking abstinence at six months or longer. Screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment followed standard Cochrane methods. We synthesised data using Bayesian component network meta‐analysis (CNMA), examining the effects of 38 different components compared to minimal intervention. Components included behavioural and motivational elements, intervention providers, delivery modes, nature, focus, and intensity of the behavioural intervention. We used component network meta‐regression (CNMR) to evaluate the influence of population characteristics, provision of pharmacotherapy, and intervention intensity on the component effects. We evaluated certainty of the evidence using GRADE domains. We assumed an additive effect for individual components. 
Main results
We included 33 Cochrane Reviews, from which 312 randomised controlled trials, representing 250,563 participants and 845 distinct study arms, met the criteria for inclusion in our component network meta‐analysis. This represented 437 different combinations of components. Of the 33 reviews, confidence in review findings was high in four reviews and moderate in nine reviews, as measured by the AMSTAR 2 critical appraisal tool. The remaining 20 reviews were low or critically low due to one or more critical weaknesses, most commonly inadequate investigation or discussion (or both) of the impact of publication bias. Of note, the critical weaknesses identified did not affect the searching, screening, or data extraction elements of the review process, which have direct bearing on our CNMA. Of the included studies, 125/312 were at low risk of bias overall, 50 were at high risk of bias, and the remainder were at unclear risk. Analyses from the contributing reviews and from our CNMA showed behavioural interventions for smoking cessation can increase quit rates, but effectiveness varies on characteristics of the support provided. There was high‐certainty evidence of benefit for the provision of counselling (odds ratio (OR) 1.44, 95% credibility interval (CrI) 1.22 to 1.70, 194 studies, n = 72,273) and guaranteed financial incentives (OR 1.46, 95% CrI 1.15 to 1.85, 19 studies, n = 8877). Evidence of benefit remained when removing studies at high risk of bias. These findings were consistent with pair‐wise meta‐analyses from contributing reviews. There was moderate‐certainty evidence of benefit for interventions delivered via text message (downgraded due to unexplained statistical heterogeneity in pair‐wise comparison), and for the following components where point estimates suggested benefit but CrIs incorporated no clinically significant difference: individual tailoring; intervention content including motivational components; intervention content focused on how to quit. The remaining intervention components had low‐to very low‐certainty evidence, with the main issues being imprecision and risk of bias. There was no evidence to suggest an increase in harms in groups receiving behavioural support for smoking cessation. Intervention effects were not changed by adjusting for population characteristics, but data were limited. Increasing intensity of behavioural support, as measured through the number of contacts, duration of each contact, and programme length, had point estimates associated with modestly increased chances of quitting, but CrIs included no difference. The effect of behavioural support for smoking cessation appeared slightly less pronounced when people were already receiving smoking cessation pharmacotherapies. 
Authors' conclusions
Behavioural support for smoking cessation can increase quit rates at six months or longer, with no evidence that support increases harms. This is the case whether or not smoking cessation pharmacotherapy is also provided, but the effect is slightly more pronounced in the absence of pharmacotherapy. Evidence of benefit is strongest for the provision of any form of counselling, and guaranteed financial incentives. Evidence suggested possible benefit but the need of further studies to evaluate: individual tailoring; delivery via text message, email, and audio recording; delivery by lay health advisor; and intervention content with motivational components and a focus on how to quit. We identified 23 economic evaluations; evidence did not consistently suggest one type of behavioural intervention for smoking cessation was more cost‐effective than another. Future reviews should fully consider publication bias. Tools to investigate publication bias and to evaluate certainty in CNMA are needed.

What types of support can help adults quit smoking?

### **Rationale**

**Why is it hard to stop smoking?**

Smoking is a main cause of sickness and death around the world. For people who smoke, quitting can heal much of the harm caused by smoking. But quitting is very hard to do.

Many people use support programs to help them stop smoking. These programs help people change their habits. They do not use medicine. There are many different types of these programs. Some work better than others.

**Why did we do this study?**

Researchers wanted to find out which support programs work best to help people quit smoking. They looked at many different things. For example, does it matter if you get support from a doctor or from a text message? Does getting paid to quit help?

This study gathered information from many past studies. The goal was to find the most helpful ways to support people who are trying to stop smoking. This information can help people choose the best support for them.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers did a large review of studies that were already done. They searched for studies about support programs for quitting smoking. They combined the results from all of them. This lets them compare many types of support at once.

This review looked at 312 different studies. The studies included over 250,000 adults who smoke. To be included, each study had to check on people for at least 6 months. This was to make sure the people who quit did not start smoking again. The researchers wanted to see what helps people stay smoke-free long-term.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The study found that support programs can help people quit smoking. People who used a support program were more likely to stop smoking for 6 months or more. The study also found that these support programs are safe. There was no proof that they caused any harm.

**What types of support worked best?**

The researchers were very sure that two types of support worked very well:
*   **Counseling:** This is when you talk to a trained person for support and advice on how to quit. Any type of counseling was found to be helpful.
*   **Guaranteed Cash Rewards:** This is when people get money if they successfully quit smoking. This also helped people a lot.

These two methods helped people quit even if they were also using medicine to stop smoking, like a patch or a pill. But the support seemed to help a little more for people who were not using any quit-smoking medicine.

Some other types of support seemed to help, but more research is needed to be sure. These included:
*   Support sent by text message.
*   Support plans that were made just for one person.
*   Support that helped people feel motivated to quit.

The researchers also looked at the cost of these programs. They did not find that one type of support was always cheaper or a better value than another.

**What do these results mean?**

This large review shows that getting support helps people quit smoking for good. The strongest proof is for counseling and for getting cash rewards for quitting. If you want to quit smoking, using a support program can increase your chances of success.","Does behavioural support help people to stop smoking?
Key messages 
Behavioural support can help more people to stop smoking for six months or longer, without causing unwanted effects. 
Some types of support appear to work better than others. More studies are needed to identify the best ways to support people who are trying to stop smoking, and to identify the best people to support them. 
Stopping smoking 
The best thing people who smoke can do for their health is to stop smoking.
Most people who smoke want to stop, but many find it difficult. People who smoke may use medicines to help them stop. Behavioural support provides an alternative – or additional – way to help people stop smoking. Sometimes behavioural support can be combined with nicotine replacement or other medicines to help people stop smoking. 
Types of behavioural support can include: advice and counselling on ways to make it easier to stop smoking; information about why or how to stop; or a combination. Behavioural support can be given in group sessions or one‐to‐one. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out:
– which types of behavioural support work best to help people stop smoking;
– the best ways to give behavioural support (including the best people to give it); and 
– what aspects of behavioural support help someone to stop smoking.
We also wanted to know if behavioural support can cause any unwanted effects.
What did we do? 
We searched for Cochrane Reviews of behavioural support to stop smoking, to identify relevant studies of adults who smoked. We then compared the studies with each other, to find out how well the different types of behavioural support helped people to stop smoking. 
Search date: we included evidence published up to July 2020. 
What we found 
We found 33 Cochrane Reviews, from which we identified 312 relevant studies in 250,503 adults (aged 18 to 63 years) who smoked cigarettes. The studies investigated 437 different combinations of ways to stop smoking. 
Most studies were conducted in the USA or Western Europe; 115 studies took place in healthcare settings and 195 took place in the community. On average, people taking part in the studies were followed up for 10.5 months. 
The studies compared the effects of behavioural support with:
– no behavioural support;
– usual or standard care;
– less‐intense forms of the behavioural support; or other approaches.
We compared all treatments with each other using a mathematical method called network meta‐analysis. 
What are the main results of our review? 
Compared with no behavioural support it was clear that some types of behavioural support increased people's chances of quitting for six months or longer, including: counselling and giving them money for successfully stopping smoking. More people stopped smoking with these types of support whether or not they were also taking medicines to help them stop smoking. 
Behavioural support by text messages probably helped more people to stop smoking than no support. 
Compared with no support, tailoring behavioural support to the person, or group of people, trying to stop smoking probably slightly increased how many of them stopped smoking, as did support that focused on how to stop smoking. 
Increasing the intensity of the support given, such as contacting people more often or having longer sessions, modestly increased how many people stopped smoking. 
We are uncertain about:
– the effects of other types of behavioural support, including hypnotherapy, exercise‐based support, and entering competitions; and 
– the effect of who gives the behavioural support.
Only some studies reported results for unwanted effects; in these, behavioural support did not increase the numbers of any unwanted effects. 
How confident are we in our results? 
We are confident that counselling and rewards of money help people to stop smoking; we do not expect that more evidence will change these results. 
We are less confident in our results for other types of behavioural support, and about who gives the support and how. We found limitations with some of the studies, including how they were designed, conducted, and reported. These results are likely to change when more evidence becomes available. More studies are needed.

The advent of medical abortion has improved access to safe abortion procedures. Medical abortion procedures involve either administering mifepristone followed by misoprostol or a misoprostol‐only regimen. The drugs are commonly administered in the presence of clinicians, which is known as provider‐administered medical abortion. In self‐administered medical abortion, drugs are administered by the woman herself without the supervision of a healthcare provider during at least one stage of the drug protocol. Self‐administration of medical abortion has the potential to provide women with control over the abortion process. In settings where there is a shortage of healthcare providers, self‐administration may reduce the burden on the health system. However, it remains unclear whether self‐administration of medical abortion is effective and safe. It is important to understand whether women can safely and effectively terminate their own pregnancies when having access to accurate and adequate information, high‐quality drugs, and facility‐based care in case of complications. 
Objectives
To compare the effectiveness, safety, and acceptability of self‐administered versus provider‐administered medical abortion in any setting. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE in process and other non‐indexed citations, Embase, CINAHL, POPLINE, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and Google Scholar from inception to 10 July 2019. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies with a concurrent comparison group, using study designs that compared medical abortion by self‐administered versus provider‐administered methods. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently extracted the data, and we performed a meta‐analysis where appropriate using Review Manager 5. Our primary outcome was successful abortion (effectiveness), defined as complete uterine evacuation without the need for surgical intervention. Ongoing pregnancy (the presence of an intact gestational sac) was our secondary outcome measuring success or effectiveness. We assessed statistical heterogeneity with Chi2 tests and I2 statistics using a cut‐off point of P < 0.10 to indicate statistical heterogeneity. Quality assessment of the data used the GRADE approach. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. 
Main results
We identified 18 studies (two RCTs and 16 non‐randomized studies (NRSs)) comprising 11,043 women undergoing early medical abortion (≤ 9 weeks gestation) in 10 countries. Sixteen studies took place in low‐to‐middle income resource settings and two studies were in high‐resource settings. One NRS study received analgesics from a pharmaceutical company. Five NRSs and one RCT did not report on funding; nine NRSs received all or partial funding from an anonymous donor. Five NRSs and one RCT received funding from government agencies, private foundations, or non‐profit bodies. The intervention in the evidence is predominantly from women taking mifepristone in the presence of a healthcare provider, and subsequently taking misoprostol without healthcare provider supervision (e.g. at home). 
There is no evidence of a difference in rates of successful abortions between self‐administered and provider‐administered groups: for two RCTs, risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.01; 919 participants; moderate certainty of evidence. There is very low certainty of evidence from 16 NRSs: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.01; 10,124 participants. 
For the outcome of ongoing pregnancy there may be little or no difference between the two groups: for one RCT: RR 1.69, 95% CI 0.41 to 7.02; 735 participants; low certainty of evidence; and very low certainty evidence for 11 NRSs: RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.49; 6691 participants. 
We are uncertain whether there are any differences in complications requiring surgical intervention, since we found no RCTs and evidence from three NRSs was of very low certainty: for three NRSs: RR 2.14, 95% CI 0.80 to 5.71; 2452 participants. 
Authors' conclusions
This review shows that self‐administering the second stage of early medical abortion procedures is as effective as provider‐administered procedures for the outcome of abortion success. There may be no difference for the outcome of ongoing pregnancy, although the evidence for this is uncertain for this outcome. There is very low‐certainty evidence for the risk of complications requiring surgical intervention. Data are limited by the scarcity of high‐quality research study designs and the presence of risks of bias. This review provides insufficient evidence to determine the safety of self‐administration when compared with administering medication in the presence of healthcare provider supervision. 
Future research should investigate the effectiveness and safety of self‐administered medical abortion in the absence of healthcare provider supervision through the entirety of the medical abortion protocol (e.g. during administration of mifepristone or as part of a misoprostol‐only regimen) and at later gestational ages (i.e. more than nine weeks). In the absence of any supervision from medical personnel, research is needed to understand how best to inform and support women who choose to self‐administer, including when to seek clinical care.

Taking Abortion Pills at Home: Is It as Good as in a Clinic?

### **Rationale**

Using pills to end a pregnancy is called a medical abortion. This is a safe way to have an abortion. It can help more women get the care they need.

There are two main ways to have a medical abortion. One way is to get the pills from a doctor or nurse at a clinic. The other way is for a woman to take the pills herself at home, without a doctor present. Taking the pills at home may give women more control and comfort. It can also help when clinics are far away or have long waits.

But we need to know if taking abortion pills at home is as safe and works as well as taking them at a clinic. This study was done to compare these two methods. Researchers wanted to see if taking the pills at home is a good option for women.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at past studies to answer their question. They combined the results of 18 different studies. This gave them information on about 11,000 women.

The women in these studies were all early in their pregnancy. This means they were 9 weeks pregnant or less. The studies took place in 10 different countries around the world.

In most of the studies, women took the first pill at a clinic with a doctor. Then, they took the second pill at home by themselves. The researchers compared these women to women who took both pills at a clinic. The goal was to see which method worked best and was safest.

### **Results**

The main question was: Did the pills work to end the pregnancy? The researchers found that taking the second pill at home worked just as well as taking it at a clinic. The chance of a successful abortion was about the same for both groups of women.

The researchers also looked at the risk of the pregnancy continuing after taking the pills. There seemed to be little or no difference between the two groups. But the researchers were not as certain about this result.

What about safety? The researchers looked at serious problems that might require surgery. They did not have enough information to say if one method was safer than the other. More research is needed to understand the risks.

The people who did the study concluded that taking the second abortion pill at home is a good choice. It is just as likely to work as taking it in a clinic. However, we need more studies to be sure about safety. We also need to learn more about what happens when women take all the abortion pills at home.","Self‐administered versus provider‐administered medical abortion (review)
Review question 
The aim of this review was to compare whether women taking abortion drugs on their own without healthcare provider supervision can do so as successfully and safely as women who take the drugs in the presence of trained healthcare providers. 
Background 
Medical abortion used to end pregnancies has been successful and safe when women have access to appropriate information and resources. In provider‐administered medical abortion, drugs are taken in the presence of trained healthcare providers. Access to medical abortion drugs has increased and has given women more control over their abortion procedures through self‐administration. In self‐administered medical abortion, the woman takes the drug(s) without the supervision of a healthcare provider after receiving appropriate information and resources. This is the first review of the published evidence on whether self‐administration of medical abortion is a safe and successful way to end pregnancies. We compared the success and safety of self‐administered medical abortion versus provider‐administered medical abortion. 
Study characteristics 
We included 18 studies (two randomized controlled trials and 16 prospective cohort studies) covering 11,043 women undergoing early medical abortion (up to nine weeks gestation) in 10 countries that compared self‐administered medical abortion to provider‐administered medical abortion, after an initial clinic visit. Most studies (16) were conducted in low‐to‐middle resource settings and two studies in high‐resource settings. The evidence described in this review is from studies published before 10 July 2019. 
Key results 
Women who self‐administer medical abortion drugs in early pregnancy (up to nine weeks gestational age) experience similar rates of completed abortion as women who undergo provider‐administered procedures in low‐to‐middle and high‐resource settings. Evidence about safety is uncertain. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence for the success of self‐administered medical abortion compared to provider‐administered medical abortion was of moderate certainty, due to low‐certainty studies. The evidence for the safety of these interventions was very low, due to low‐certainty studies.

10.1002-14651858.CD013316.pub2,"Background
Glioblastoma is an aggressive form of brain cancer. Approximately five in 100 people with glioblastoma survive for five years past diagnosis. Glioblastomas that have a particular modification to their DNA (called methylation) in a particular region (the O6‐methylguanine–DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter) respond better to treatment with chemotherapy using a drug called temozolomide. 
Objectives
To determine which method for assessing MGMT methylation status best predicts overall survival in people diagnosed with glioblastoma who are treated with temozolomide. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS, Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index to December 2018, and examined reference lists. For economic evaluation studies, we additionally searched NHS Economic Evaluation Database (EED) up to December 2014. 
Selection criteria
Eligible studies were longitudinal (cohort) studies of adults with diagnosed glioblastoma treated with temozolomide with/without radiotherapy/surgery. Studies had to have related MGMT status in tumour tissue (assessed by one or more method) with overall survival and presented results as hazard ratios or with sufficient information (e.g. Kaplan‐Meier curves) for us to estimate hazard ratios. We focused mainly on studies comparing two or more methods, and listed brief details of articles that examined a single method of measuring MGMT promoter methylation. We also sought economic evaluations conducted alongside trials, modelling studies and cost analysis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently undertook all steps of the identification and data extraction process for multiple‐method studies. We assessed risk of bias and applicability using our own modified and extended version of the QUality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. We compared different techniques, exact promoter regions (5'‐cytosine‐phosphate‐guanine‐3' (CpG) sites) and thresholds for interpretation within studies by examining hazard ratios. We performed meta‐analyses for comparisons of the three most commonly examined methods (immunohistochemistry (IHC), methylation‐specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) and pyrosequencing (PSQ)), with ratios of hazard ratios (RHR), using an imputed value of the correlation between results based on the same individuals. 
Main results
We included 32 independent cohorts involving 3474 people that compared two or more methods. We found evidence that MSP (CpG sites 76 to 80 and 84 to 87) is more prognostic than IHC for MGMT protein at varying thresholds (RHR 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 1.71). We also found evidence that PSQ is more prognostic than IHC for MGMT protein at various thresholds (RHR 1.36, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.84). The data suggest that PSQ (mainly at CpG sites 74 to 78, using various thresholds) is slightly more prognostic than MSP at sites 76 to 80 and 84 to 87 (RHR 1.14, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.48). Many variants of PSQ have been compared, although we did not see any strong and consistent messages from the results. Targeting multiple CpG sites is likely to be more prognostic than targeting just one. In addition, we identified and summarised 190 articles describing a single method for measuring MGMT promoter methylation status. 
Authors' conclusions
PSQ and MSP appear more prognostic for overall survival than IHC. Strong evidence is not available to draw conclusions with confidence about the best CpG sites or thresholds for quantitative methods. MSP has been studied mainly for CpG sites 76 to 80 and 84 to 87 and PSQ at CpG sites ranging from 72 to 95. A threshold of 9% for CpG sites 74 to 78 performed better than higher thresholds of 28% or 29% in two of three good‐quality studies making such comparisons.

Which Test is Best to Guide Treatment for a Type of Brain Cancer?

**Rationale**
Glioblastoma is a serious type of cancer that starts in the brain. It is a very aggressive cancer, which means it can grow and spread quickly. Because it is so serious, living for a long time after being diagnosed is not common. For every 100 people with this cancer, only about 5 will live for five years or more.

Doctors use strong drugs called chemotherapy to fight this cancer. One chemotherapy drug used for glioblastoma is named temozolomide. This drug can be helpful, but it works much better for some people than for others. Researchers found that this difference is because of the cancer's genes. Genes are like instruction manuals inside our body’s cells. Sometimes, the cancer's genes have a special change. This change is called methylation. When a specific cancer gene has this change, the chemotherapy drug works much better.

It is very important for doctors to know if a person’s cancer has this gene change. This knowledge helps them create the best treatment plan for each person. If the test shows the change is there, the doctor knows the chemotherapy is more likely to help. There are several different tests that can look for this gene change. But doctors were not sure which test was the most accurate. This study was done to find out which test is the best one to use. Researchers wanted to see which test could most reliably predict which patients would live longer after treatment.

**Trial Design**
This study was a large review of past research. This means the researchers did not do a new experiment with new patients. Instead, they carefully searched for and gathered information from studies that were already completed. Combining the results from many studies can give a stronger and more trustworthy answer than looking at just one small study.

The researchers looked for studies that included adults who were diagnosed with glioblastoma. In all these studies, the patients had been treated with the chemotherapy drug temozolomide. Some of them may have also had surgery to remove the tumor or radiation therapy. The researchers made sure the studies they chose had tested the patients’ tumors for the special gene change. The studies also needed to have information about how long the patients lived.

The researchers found 32 different groups of patients from past studies. When they put all the information together, they had data from over 3,400 people. This large amount of information helped them compare the different tests in a powerful way.

**Results**
The main goal was to see which test was best at predicting a person's outcome. The researchers compared three main types of tests.

One test, called IHC, works by looking for a protein. Genes tell cells to make proteins, so this test looks at the result of the gene's activity. The other two tests, called MSP and PSQ, are different. They work by looking directly at the cancer’s genes to see if the special change is there.

The results were clear. The MSP and PSQ tests were both better than the IHC test. They were more accurate at predicting which patients would live longer after being treated with the chemotherapy drug. This suggests that it is better to look directly at the gene for the change, rather than looking for the protein the gene makes.

When comparing the two better tests, the PSQ test seemed to be slightly more accurate than the MSP test. However, the difference between them was small. The researchers also found that it is probably better to check for the gene change in several spots on the gene, not just one.

The final conclusion from the researchers is that doctors should use either the PSQ or MSP test to check for the gene change. These tests give the most reliable information to help guide treatment. This helps doctors and patients make more informed choices. The researchers also noted that we still need to learn more. Future studies should try to find the exact best way to perform these tests to get the most accurate results possible.","Which method of determining MGMT promoter methylation best predicts survival in people with glioblastoma treated with temozolomide? 
What was the aim of this review? 
Glioblastoma is a very aggressive type of brain cancer. People with glioblastoma are usually treated with surgical removal of the tumour followed by radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or both. The standard chemotherapy is a medicine called temozolomide. Some glioblastoma tumours have a particular modification in their DNA (which contains the genetic code of organisms), and knowing whether a person has this modification is useful to predict how long the person may live after their diagnosis with cancer and how they may respond to temozolomide. The modification is known as 'methylation of the MGMT promoter region' and it can also affect MGMT protein expression (the way MGMT is made and modified). There are many ways to work out whether a tumour has this modification. In this review, we attempted to work out which method is best. 
What we found 
We identified 32 studies comparing different ways to measure whether the MGMT promoter region is methylated. The main three methods were called 'methylation‐specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR),' 'pyrosequencing' (both of which look directly at the MGMT promoter region) and 'immunohistochemistry' (which looks at MGMT protein expression). We found that methylation‐specific PCR and pyrosequencing are better at predicting overall survival than immunohistochemistry. Methylation‐specific PCR and pyrosequencing can be carried out by targeting different parts of the tumour DNA. Pyrosequencing can be performed using different cut‐off thresholds to determine whether a tumour is methylated or unmethylated. We did not identify very clear signals in terms of the best parts of the DNA to target or which are the best cut‐off thresholds. 
How reliable are results of the studies in this review? 
We rated our confidence in the evidence as 'moderate' for our conclusions about methylation‐specific PCR, but as 'low' for pyrosequencing. Although there were many studies, they all looked at different variants of the methods, so it is difficult to work out exactly which variant is best. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Our review indicates both methylation‐specific PCR and pyrosequencing provide better predictions of survival than immunohistochemistry. There is some evidence that pyrosequencing may be better than methylation‐specific PCR at predicting overall survival, depending on the DNA targets and cut‐off thresholds used. We documented the most frequent DNA targets used in methylation‐specific PCR and pyrosequencing. We described cut‐off thresholds used in pyrosequencing, although it is unclear which of these is best.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive, life‐limiting, multisystem disease affecting over 70,000 individuals worldwide. Between 80% and 90% of people with CF suffer with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, which if left untreated, leads to a poor nutritional status. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) has been shown to be effective in improving nutritional status and subsequently associated with improved lung function. However, the timings of PERT administration in relation to a meal are subjective and not standardised, meaning that variations in the timing of PERT dosing persist. 
Objectives
The primary objective of the review is to compare the efficacy (fat absorption) and effectiveness (nutritional status, lung function and quality of life) of different PERT dosing strategies in terms of timing of administration for treating dietary malabsorption in all individuals with CF. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. 
Date of last search: 24 June 2021.
We also searched ongoing trials registers on 09 July 2021.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over RCTs with a minimum washout period of two weeks, and quasi‐RCTs of PERT dosing regimens in people (of any age) with CF. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed and screened the studies identified from the searches. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for our pre‐specified critical outcomes, but we did not identify any eligible studies. 
Main results
No studies met the eligibility criteria and therefore we did not include any in this review. The excluded studies were either cross‐over in design (but lacking a sufficient washout period between treatments) or did not assess the timing of PERT. One study which was terminated early is awaiting assessment pending further information. 
Authors' conclusions
We were unable to determine whether one dosing schedule for PERT is better than another since we identified no eligible RCTs. While the introduction of PERT to people with CF can improve their nutritional status, there are a limited number of studies which address this review question, and none met our eligibility criteria. Since malnutrition and adverse gastrointestinal symptoms remain a common feature in CF, the assessment of the relative performance of dosing schedules may provide evidence to improve outcomes in people with CF who are pancreatic insufficient. 
Further research is needed to fully evaluate the role of dosing schedules for PERT in fat absorption. Research should also establish reliable outcome measures and minimal clinically important differences. While RCTs with a cross‐over design may have advantages over a parallel group design, an adequate washout period between intervention periods is essential.

Finding the Best Time to Take Pancreas Medicine for People with Cystic Fibrosis

**Rationale**
Cystic fibrosis, or CF, is a serious health condition that people are born with. It affects many parts of the body. Many thousands of people around the world live with CF.

Most people with CF have a problem with an organ called the pancreas. The pancreas is in your belly. It makes special juices called enzymes that help your body break down food. In CF, the pancreas may not make enough of these enzymes. This makes it hard for the body to get nutrients from food. This can lead to poor growth and weight loss.

To help with this, people with CF take a medicine. This medicine is called pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, or PERT. PERT gives the body the enzymes it needs to digest food properly. Taking PERT helps people with CF get the right nutrition. This can also help their lungs stay healthy.

But doctors are not sure about the best time to take PERT. People take it before, during, or after a meal. We do not know if one time works better than another. This study was done to look at all the research and find the best time to take PERT.

**Trial Design**
This was not a study that tested a medicine on new patients. Instead, the researchers did a review. This means they looked for studies that had already been done by other scientists.

The researchers had strict rules for the studies they wanted to find. They only looked for a special type of study called a randomized controlled trial, or RCT. In these studies, people are put into groups by chance to try different treatments. This is the best way to compare treatments fairly.

The researchers looked for studies that included people of any age with CF. All the people in the studies had to have the pancreas problem that CF can cause. The main goal was to find high-quality studies that compared different times for taking PERT. For example, a study might compare taking PERT before a meal to taking it during a meal.

**Results**
The researchers looked very hard for studies that met their rules. After a careful search, they could not find any studies to include in their review.

Some studies they found were not set up in the right way to give clear answers. Other studies did not look at the timing of when people took the medicine. Because they found no studies that fit their rules, the researchers could not compare the different times for taking PERT.

This means we still do not know if there is a best time to take PERT. There is no strong proof to say that one time is better than another. This review could not find any new information to help patients.

The researchers who did the review concluded that more research is needed. They believe good studies must be done to find the best time to take PERT. Finding the answer could help people with CF get more from their food. It could also help reduce tummy problems. This research is important to improve the health of people with CF.","Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy timings in cystic fibrosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the different timings of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) in people (of any age) with cystic fibrosis (CF). 
Background 
CF is an inherited condition affecting over 70,000 individuals worldwide. Between 80% and 90% of people with CF are not able to produce enough pancreatic enzymes to breakdown and absorb fat, protein and fat‐soluble vitamins from food. This can lead to fatty stools (poo) and weight loss. It is thought that if fat is not digested properly, it could contribute to a higher risk of developing constipation or other serious gut complications such as distal intestinal obstruction syndrome. 
PERT provides the enzymes required to breakdown fat and the dosage is based upon the fat content of a meal or the person's body weight. PERT has been shown to improve weight and is associated with improved lung function. Despite current dose guidance, there are differences in PERT doses and there is no set guidance for when the therapy should be taken in relation to a meal (i.e. before, during or after eating). 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 24 June 2021.
Study characteristics 
We did not find any studies where PERT was given to people with CF who were pancreatic insufficient at different timings relative to their meals. We excluded nine studies. Four of these assessed the timing of PERT administration, but they had a cross‐over design where participants had one intervention and then swapped to the second intervention. We excluded these studies because they did not leave enough time between the different interventions to be sure that the effects of the first intervention were not affecting the results from the second intervention. Four studies did not look at the timing of PERT and one study evaluated a new educational program for PERT. One study was terminated early and we will assess this again at the first update of this review if we are able to obtain more information from the investigators. 
Key results 
No studies met the eligibility criteria. Further research is needed to work out the best time to take PERT in relation to a meal.

Diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive cancer of the lymphatic system. About 30% to 40% of people with DLBCL experience relapse and 10% are refractory to first‐line treatment usually consisting of R‐CHOP chemotherapy. Of those eligible for second‐line treatment, commonly consisting of salvage chemotherapy followed by autologous stem‐cell transplantation (ASCT), around 50% experience relapse. With a median overall survival of less than six to 12 months, the prognosis of individuals who relapse or are refractory (r/r) to advanced lines of treatment or of those who are ineligible for ASCT, is very poor. With the introduction of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T‐cell therapy, a novel treatment option for these people is available. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T‐cell therapy for people with relapsed or refractory (r/r) DLBCL. 
Search methods
An experienced information specialist performed a systematic database search for relevant articles on CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase until September 11th, 2020. We also searched trial registries and reference lists of identified studies up to this date. All search results were screened by two authors independently and a third author was involved in case of discrepancies. 
Selection criteria
We included prospectively planned trials evaluating CAR T‐cell therapy for people with r/r DLBCL. We had planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and we flexibly adapted eligibility criteria to the most reliable study designs available. We excluded studies involving fewer than 10 participants with r/r DLBCL and studies with a proportion of participants with r/r DLBCL below 70%, unless data were reported separately for this subgroup. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors extracted data and performed risk of bias ratings independently. A third author was involved in case of disagreements. As our search did not yield any completed RCTs, prospective controlled non‐randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) or prospective observational studies with a control group, we did not meta‐analyse data and reported all results narratively. We adopted the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for prioritised outcomes. 
Main results
We identified 13 eligible uncontrolled studies evaluating a single or multiple arms of CAR T‐cell therapies. We also identified 38 ongoing studies, including three RCTs. Ten studies are awaiting classification due to completion with no retrievable results data or insufficient data to justify inclusion. The mean number of participants enrolled, treated with CAR T‐cell therapy and evaluated in the included studies were 79 (range 12 to 344; data unavailable for two studies), 61 (range 12 to 294; data unavailable for one study) and 52 (range 11 to 256), respectively. 
Most studies included people with r/r DLBCL among people with other haematological B‐cell malignancies. Participants had received at least a median of three prior treatment lines (data unavailable for four studies), 5% to 50% had undergone ASCT (data unavailable for five studies) and, except for two studies, 3% to 18% had undergone allogenic stem‐cell transplantation (data unavailable for eight studies). 
The overall risk of bias was high for all studies, in particular, due to incomplete follow‐up and the absence of blinding. None of the included studies had a control group so that no adequate comparative effect measures could be calculated. The duration of follow‐up varied substantially between studies, in particular, for harms. Our certainty in the evidence is very low for all outcomes. 
Overall survival was reported by eight studies (567 participants). Four studies reported survival rates at 12 months which ranged between 48% and 59%, and one study reported an overall survival rate of 50.5% at 24 months. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cell therapy on overall survival. 
Two studies including 294 participants at baseline and 59 participants at the longest follow‐up (12 months or 18 months) described improvements of quality of life measured with the EuroQol 5‐Dimension 5‐Level visual analogue scale (EQ‐5D‐5L VAS) or Function Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐Lymphoma (FACT‐Lym). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cell therapy on quality of life. 
None of the studies reported treatment‐related mortality.
Five studies (550 participants) reported the occurrence of adverse events among participants, ranging between 99% and 100% for any grade adverse events and 68% to 98% for adverse events grade ≥ 3. In three studies (253 participants), 56% to 68% of participants experienced serious adverse events, while in one study (28 participants), no serious adverse events occurred. CAR T‐cell therapy may increase the risk of adverse events and serious adverse events but the evidence is very uncertain about the exact risk. 
The occurrence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was reported in 11 studies (675 participants) under use of various grading criteria. Five studies reported between 42% and 100% of participants experiencing CRS according to criteria described in Lee 2014. CAR T‐cell therapy may increase the risk of CRS but the evidence is very uncertain about the exact risk. 
Nine studies (575 participants) reported results on progression‐free survival, disease‐free survival or relapse‐free survival. Twelve‐month progression‐free survival rates were reported by four studies and ranged between 44% and 75%. In one study, relapse‐free survival remained at a rate of 64% at both 12 and 18 months. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cell therapy on progression‐free survival. 
Thirteen studies (620 participants) provided data on complete response rates. At six months, three studies reported complete response rates between 40% and 45%. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cell therapy on complete response rates. 
Authors' conclusions
The available evidence on the benefits and harms of CAR T‐cell therapy for people with r/r DLBCL is limited, mainly because of the absence of comparative clinical trials. The results we present should be regarded in light of this limitation and conclusions should be drawn very carefully. Due to the uncertainty in the current evidence, a large number of ongoing investigations and a risk of substantial and potentially life‐threatening complications requiring supplementary treatment, it is critical to continue evaluating the evidence on this new therapy.

A Review of a New Treatment for a Type of Blood Cancer

### **Rationale**

**What is this review about?**

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, is a type of cancer in the body’s infection-fighting system. It can grow very quickly. The first treatment for DLBCL is often a mix of cancer drugs. For many people, this treatment works well.

But for about 4 out of 10 people, the cancer comes back after treatment. Or, the treatment does not work at all. When this happens, the outlook for patients is often poor. There is a need for new treatments for these patients.

A new type of treatment is called CAR T-cell therapy. This therapy changes a person's own immune cells to help them find and kill cancer cells. Researchers did this review to look at all the studies on CAR T-cell therapy. They wanted to see how well it works and what its harms are for people with DLBCL that has come back or not gone away.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this review done?**

This was not a study where patients received a new treatment. Instead, researchers looked for all the studies that had already been done on CAR T-cell therapy for DLBCL. They searched for studies published up to September 2020.

The researchers looked for studies that included adults with DLBCL. These patients had already tried other cancer treatments that did not work or their cancer had returned. The researchers planned to compare CAR T-cell therapy to other treatments.

However, the researchers could not find any studies that made this comparison. They found 13 studies that only looked at patients who received CAR T-cell therapy. These studies did not have a comparison group of patients who received a different treatment. This makes it very hard to know for sure what effects were from the CAR T-cell therapy.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of this review?**

The researchers found that the evidence on CAR T-cell therapy is very unclear. This is because none of the studies they found compared it to another treatment. The results below should be read with great care.

**How did the treatment affect how long people lived?**
Some studies looked at how many people were still alive 1 year after treatment. They found that about 5 out of 10 people were still alive. But because there was no comparison group, we cannot be sure about this result. The evidence is very uncertain.

**How did the treatment affect people’s cancer?**
Some studies looked at how many people had no signs of cancer after 6 months. They found this happened in about 4 out of 10 people. Again, the evidence for this is very uncertain.

**What were the side effects of the treatment?**
Almost every person in the studies had side effects. Many people had very serious side effects. One common and serious side effect is called cytokine release syndrome, or CRS. This is when the body’s immune system overreacts to the treatment. It can cause a high fever and other problems. Because the studies were not perfect, we are very uncertain about the exact risk of these side effects.

**What did the researchers conclude?**
The researchers who did this review concluded that we know very little about the real benefits and harms of CAR T-cell therapy. The studies that exist are not strong enough to give us clear answers.

The researchers believe it is very important to keep studying this new therapy. There are many studies, including better-designed ones, that are happening now. The results from these new studies will give us a much clearer picture in the future.","CAR T‐cell therapy for people with diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma which returns after treatment or no longer responds to treatment 
Background 
Diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a fast‐growing cancer of the lymphatic system, an important part of the immune system. It affects blood cells that produce antibodies to fight infections. 
DLBCL is potentially curable. Most people with DLBCL respond well to initial therapies such as chemotherapy. For some people, the disease becomes refractory, which means it no longer responds to treatment, or it relapses, which means it returns after treatment. As a second‐line treatment, people with DLBCL can receive chemotherapy coupled with stem‐cell transplantation, but not all people are candidates for this therapy. From those who are, around 50% experience relapse after treatment. People who relapse or are refractory to advanced lines of treatment and those who are not candidates for a stem‐cell transplant have a very poor prognosis: Only half of them survive longer than six to 12 months. 
A promising treatment for these people is 'chimeric antigen receptor' (CAR) T‐cell therapy, which utilises the body's own immune cells (T‐cells) to fight DLBCL. T‐cells are removed from the person's blood, equipped with so‐called 'chimeric antigen receptors' (CARs), that help to recognise and destroy the cancer cells, in the laboratory and then delivered back into the person's blood. 
What was our aim? 
We wanted to explore whether CAR T‐cells are an effective treatment for people with DLBCL that returns after treatment (relapses) or no longer responds to treatment (is refractory). We also wanted to explore the frequency of unwanted effects associated with CAR T‐cell therapy. 
What did we do? 
We searched for all available clinical studies on treatment with CAR T‐cells for people with relapsed or refractory DLBCL to summarise the current evidence. We also evaluated the risk of bias in included studies and rated our confidence in the evidence. 
What did we find? 
We found 13 studies with information on 679 participants (who had received several prior lines of therapy) that received CAR T‐cell therapy. None of the studies had a control group. This means CAR T‐cells were not compared with another treatment. We decided not to meta‐analyse the study results and reported all results narratively. We also found 38 ongoing studies. 
What are the key results? 
Eight studies with 567 participants evaluated overall survival. After 12 months, around half of participants were alive in four studies. In one study, around half of participants were alive after 24 months. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cells on survival. 
Two studies (294 participants at study start; 59 participants at study end) reported that quality of life improved over time. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cells on quality of life. 
Deaths related to the therapy were not reported.
Five studies (550 participants) reported on adverse events. Almost all participants (99% to 100%) experienced some kind of adverse event (including mild events). Between 68% and 98% of participants had adverse events that were severe. CAR T‐cells may increase the risk of adverse events but the evidence about the exact risk is very uncertain. 
In three studies (253 participants), 56% to 68% of participants experienced serious adverse events, while in one study (28 participants), participants had no serious adverse events. CAR T‐cells may increase the risk of serious adverse events but the evidence about the exact risk is very uncertain. 
Eleven studies (675 participants) reported on the frequency of 'cytokine release syndrome' (CRS), an overreaction of the immune system that is typically seen in CAR T‐cell therapy. It includes fever and can include symptoms such as chills, muscle pain or dizziness. Several scales were used across the studies to describe CRS. In five studies using the same scale, between 42% and 100% of participants had CRS. CAR T‐cells may increase the risk of CRS but the evidence about the exact risk is very uncertain. 
Nine studies (575 participants) reported when DLBCL relapsed (returned) or progressed (got worse). Four studies reported that, at 12 months, DLBCL did not progress in 44% to 75% of participants. In one study, 64% of participants did not relapse at both 12, and 18 months. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cells on DLBCL relapse or progress. 
Thirteen studies (620 participants) reported how many participants had a complete response (all signs of cancer disappeared). In three studies, between 40% and 45% of participants experienced a complete response at six months. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cells on complete response. 
What does this mean? 
The evidence on CAR T‐cells in the treatment of relapsed or refractory DLBCL is very uncertain. This is mainly because, today, there are no direct comparisons of CAR T‐cells with other treatments. People who receive CAR T‐cells can have severe adverse events that require additional treatment. We identified many ongoing studies and some of them compare CAR T‐cells with standard care. We will keep evaluating the evidence on this novel therapy. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence is current to September 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD002948.pub2,"Herbal therapy for rheumatoid arthritis
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effects of herbal therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
The review shows that in people with RA:
‐ Evening primrose oil, borage seed oil, or blackcurrent seed oil (containing gamma‐linolenic acid (GLA)) probably improve pain; may improve function; and probably does not increase adverse events (unwanted side effects). 
‐ Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F may improve some symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, and higher doses (180 mg ‐ 350 mg daily) may be more effective than lower doses (60 mg daily). There are some adverse events associated with Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F. 
‐ We are uncertain of the effects of other herbal therapies because only single studies were available, or important features of RA, such as changes in the number of swollen and tender joints, were not reported. 
Often we do not have precise information about side effects and complications, particularly for rare but serious side effects. Possible side effects associated with Triperygium wilfordii Hook F may include painful periods in women, decreased fertility in men, insufficient urine excretion, and increased rate of infections. Possible side effects associated with GLA sourced from evening primrose oil include headache, nausea, and diarrhoea, and rare complications include allergy and seizures. 
What is rheumatoid arthritis and what is herbal therapy? 
When you have RA, your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the lining of your joints. This makes your joints swollen, stiff and painful. The small joints of your hands and feet are usually affected first. There is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis at present, so treatments are used to relieve pain and stiffness and improve your ability to move. 
Herbal interventions are defined as any plant preparation (whole, powder, extract, standardised mixture) used for medicinal purposes. Historically, many herbal therapies have been used to treat RA. Like conventional non‐herbal drugs, many herbal therapies are believed to act by blocking the activity of these immune cells and substances and reducing inflammation in the joints, and some people believe they have fewer side effects.  
Best estimate of what happens to people with rheumatoid arthritis:  
Pain (higher scores mean worse or more severe pain):
‐People who took eveing primrose oil, primrose oil, borage seed oil, or blackcurrent seed oil (wih the active ingredient GLA) rated their pain to be 33 points lower (9 to 56 points lower) on a scale of 0 to 100 after 6 months of treatment (33% absolute improvement). 
‐People who took placebo rated their pain to be 19 points lower after treatment.
Physical function (higher score means greater disability):
‐People who took GLA rated their disability 16% better.
‐People who placebo rated their disability 5% better.

### **Plain Title**

Do Plant-Based Medicines Help with Rheumatoid Arthritis?

### **Rationale**

**What is rheumatoid arthritis?**

Rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, is a health problem where your body's defense system gets confused. This system is called the immune system. It normally fights off germs to keep you healthy. But in people with RA, the immune system attacks the body's own joints.

This attack makes the joints swollen, stiff, and painful. RA often starts in the small joints of the hands and feet. Right now, there is no cure for RA. So, treatments are used to help with the pain and stiffness. The goal of treatment is to help people move more easily and feel better.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

This research looked at plant-based medicines, also called herbal therapies. Researchers wanted to know if these therapies could help people with RA. Some people believe that plant-based medicines can reduce joint swelling and pain. They also hope that these treatments have fewer unwanted side effects than other drugs. This study looked at past research to see if these plant-based medicines are safe and if they work for RA.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this research designed?**

This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results from many past studies that were already completed. Looking at many studies all at once is called a review. A review helps researchers get a bigger and clearer picture of whether a treatment works.

The people in these studies were all adults who had rheumatoid arthritis. In each study, some people took a plant-based medicine. Other people took a ""placebo."" A placebo is a pretend pill, like a sugar pill, that has no medicine in it. Using a placebo helps researchers know for sure if the real medicine is the reason people get better. Most people in these studies took the treatments for about 6 months.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

Researchers found that the results were different for different plant-based medicines.

**Plant oils with an ingredient called GLA**

Some studies looked at oils from plants like evening primrose, borage, and blackcurrant. These oils have an active part called GLA (gamma-linolenic acid). These oils likely help reduce pain for people with RA. People who took the oils felt more pain relief than people who took the pretend pill. These oils may also help people move better and do daily tasks more easily.

These oils seem to be safe. They probably do not cause more side effects than a pretend pill. Some people who took the oils had mild side effects. These included headaches, feeling sick to their stomach, or diarrhea. In very rare cases, serious problems like seizures have been reported.

**A plant called Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F**

This is another type of plant-based medicine. It is sometimes called Thunder God Vine. This plant may help improve some RA symptoms. Studies found that a larger amount of this medicine seemed to work better than a smaller amount.

However, this plant also had some serious side effects. For women, it could cause painful periods. For men, it could make it harder to have children. Other serious side effects included problems with how the body gets rid of urine. It could also lead to getting infections more easily.

**Other plant-based medicines**

For other types of plant-based medicines, we do not have enough information. There were not enough studies, or the studies did not report on important changes, like how many joints were swollen or sore. Because of this, we are not sure if other plant-based medicines work for RA.

**What do these results mean?**

Some plant-based medicines may help people with RA. Plant oils with GLA seem to reduce pain and are likely safe for most people. Another plant medicine, sometimes called Thunder God Vine, may also help. But it comes with serious risks. For many other plant-based medicines, we need more research to know if they are helpful or safe.","Herbal therapy for rheumatoid arthritis
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effects of herbal therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
The review shows that in people with RA:
‐ Evening primrose oil, borage seed oil, or blackcurrent seed oil (containing gamma‐linolenic acid (GLA)) probably improve pain; may improve function; and probably does not increase adverse events (unwanted side effects). 
‐ Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F may improve some symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, and higher doses (180 mg ‐ 350 mg daily) may be more effective than lower doses (60 mg daily). There are some adverse events associated with Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F. 
‐ We are uncertain of the effects of other herbal therapies because only single studies were available, or important features of RA, such as changes in the number of swollen and tender joints, were not reported. 
Often we do not have precise information about side effects and complications, particularly for rare but serious side effects. Possible side effects associated with Triperygium wilfordii Hook F may include painful periods in women, decreased fertility in men, insufficient urine excretion, and increased rate of infections. Possible side effects associated with GLA sourced from evening primrose oil include headache, nausea, and diarrhoea, and rare complications include allergy and seizures. 
What is rheumatoid arthritis and what is herbal therapy? 
When you have RA, your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the lining of your joints. This makes your joints swollen, stiff and painful. The small joints of your hands and feet are usually affected first. There is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis at present, so treatments are used to relieve pain and stiffness and improve your ability to move. 
Herbal interventions are defined as any plant preparation (whole, powder, extract, standardised mixture) used for medicinal purposes. Historically, many herbal therapies have been used to treat RA. Like conventional non‐herbal drugs, many herbal therapies are believed to act by blocking the activity of these immune cells and substances and reducing inflammation in the joints, and some people believe they have fewer side effects.  
Best estimate of what happens to people with rheumatoid arthritis:  
Pain (higher scores mean worse or more severe pain):
‐People who took eveing primrose oil, primrose oil, borage seed oil, or blackcurrent seed oil (wih the active ingredient GLA) rated their pain to be 33 points lower (9 to 56 points lower) on a scale of 0 to 100 after 6 months of treatment (33% absolute improvement). 
‐People who took placebo rated their pain to be 19 points lower after treatment.
Physical function (higher score means greater disability):
‐People who took GLA rated their disability 16% better.
‐People who placebo rated their disability 5% better.

10.1002-14651858.CD005974.pub5,"Are oral homeopathic medicinal products effective and safe to prevent and treat acute respiratory tract infections in children? 
Review question 
We investigated whether oral homeopathic medicinal products are effective and safe to prevent or treat acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in children compared with an inactive (placebo) treatment or other medicines. 
Background 
Most respiratory infections resolve without treatment, but sometimes symptoms persist after the initial infection has gone. Treatment is therefore aimed at relieving symptoms. Respiratory infections are commonly caused by viruses, especially colds and flu, though some lung and ear infections are caused by bacteria. It may be difficult to distinguish between viral and bacterial infections, and they may coexist. Antibiotics are often prescribed for respiratory infections even though they are ineffective against viruses. 
Children have on average three to six respiratory tract infections annually. Although most are mild and treatable, they sometimes require hospital treatment, and very rarely result in death. 
Homeopathy may treat respiratory infections with few side effects, but its effectiveness and safety has not been well researched. 
We assessed evidence from randomised controlled trials (studies that allocate people by chance to receive treatment), which is the best way to assess the safety and efficacy of medical treatments. 
Search date 
Our evidence is current to 27 November 2017.
Study characteristics 
We included eight studies involving 1562 children that compared oral homeopathic treatment to either placebo or standard treatment to prevent or treat respiratory infections in children. All studies investigated upper respiratory tract (from the nose to the windpipe (trachea)) infections, but one combined reporting of upper and lower respiratory tract (from the windpipe to the lungs and pleura (membranes covering the lungs)) infections, so the numbers of children with upper or lower infections is unknown. 
Study funding sources 
Three studies received funding from homeopathy manufacturers; one reported support from a non‐government organisation; two received government support; one was cosponsored by a university; and one did not report funding support. 
Key results 
Studies investigated a range of interventions for various illnesses and populations using different outcome measures, so only a small number could be combined for analysis. All moderate‐quality studies (low risk of bias) showed little or no beneficial effects for homeopathic medicinal products, whether individualised by a trained homeopath or a standard, non‐individualised commercially available therapy. Where results could be combined, there was probably little or no difference in benefit on short‐ or long‐term cure, or in prevention of ARTI. 
Two low‐quality studies (unclear or high risk of bias) showed some benefit of homeopathic medicinal products for a limited number of outcomes. One study showed a reduction in disease severity for the homeopathy group at some time points. The other study showed a reduction in number of respiratory infections over the following year in the treatment groups, although more than a quarter of participants were not accounted for in the results. There was no difference between homeopathy and placebo groups for parents' time off work, antibiotic use, or adverse effects. Consequently, there is no convincing evidence homeopathic medicinal products are effective in treating ARTIs in children. We are unsure about safety because data on adverse events were poorly reported. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated evidence as moderate or low quality for most outcomes. Three outcomes provided very low‐quality evidence because study populations and results differed significantly among studies; there were significant limitations in study design and reporting; and sample sizes were small.

### **Plain Title**

Does Homeopathy Help Children with Colds and Breathing Problems?

### **Rationale**

Children often get sick with colds, the flu, or other breathing problems. These are also called respiratory infections. These illnesses affect the nose, throat, and lungs. Most of the time, these sicknesses are caused by germs called viruses. They usually go away on their own.

Treatments for these illnesses often just help with the symptoms, like a stuffy nose or a cough. Doctors sometimes give drugs called antibiotics. But antibiotics only work on germs called bacteria, not on viruses. So, they do not help with most colds and flu.

Homeopathy is a different kind of treatment. Some people believe it can help with breathing problems and has few side effects. But we do not have much good research to know if this is true. This review was done to look at the best studies available. The goal was to see if there is good proof that homeopathy is safe and works to treat or prevent breathing problems in children.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at studies that were already done. They found 8 good studies to review. In total, these studies included over 1,500 children with breathing problems.

The studies they looked at were designed to be very fair. In these studies, children were put into different groups by chance. One group of children received a homeopathic medicine. Another group received a fake medicine, like a sugar pill. This helps to see if the real medicine is actually working.

The children in these studies had infections of the nose, throat, and airways. Researchers wanted to compare the groups to see which children got better faster or had fewer illnesses.

### **Results**

The researchers carefully looked at the results from all 8 studies. The best studies showed that homeopathy did not seem to help the children. The children who took homeopathic medicine did not get better any faster than the children who took the fake medicine. Homeopathy also did not help prevent children from getting sick.

Two of the studies were not as well-designed. These two studies showed that homeopathy might have a small benefit. For example, in one study, children who took homeopathy seemed to have less severe symptoms at certain times. But because these studies had flaws, we cannot trust their results as much.

The review also found that there was no difference between the groups for other things. For example, parents of children taking homeopathy did not have to take less time off work. The children taking homeopathy were not given antibiotics any less often.

The studies did not give much information about side effects. Because of this, the researchers could not say if homeopathic medicines are safe for children.

In the end, the researchers concluded that there is no strong proof that homeopathy works to treat or prevent breathing problems in children. More high-quality research would be needed to know for sure.","Are oral homeopathic medicinal products effective and safe to prevent and treat acute respiratory tract infections in children?

10.1002-14651858.CD011391.pub2,"Key‐hole (laparoscopic) versus standard access (open) abdominal operation for people with pancreatic cancer 
Review question 
How does key‐hole (laparoscopic) abdominal surgery compare with standard access (open) abdominal operation for people with pancreatic cancer? 
Background 
The pancreas is an organ in the abdomen that secretes pancreatic juice that aids digestion and contains cells that produce important hormones such as insulin. The pancreas can be divided into the head of the pancreas (right part of the pancreas) and the body and tail of the pancreas (left part or distal part of the pancreas). Distal pancreatic cancer is cancer of the body and/or tail of the pancreas. Removal of distal pancreatic cancer by surgery (distal pancreatectomy) is the preferred treatment for people with distal pancreatic cancers limited to the pancreas who are likely to withstand major surgery, because no other treatments have the potential to cure pancreatic cancer. Cancer can be removed through an abdominal operation, either laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy or open distal pancreatectomy. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is a relatively new procedure as compared with the well‐established open distal pancreatectomy. In operations on other parts of the body, laparoscopic surgery has been shown to reduce complications and length of hospital stay as compared with open surgery. However, concerns remain about the safety of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy in terms of complications after operation (postoperative complications). In addition, it is not clear whether laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy achieves the same amount of cancer clearance as is attained by open distal pancreatectomy. It also is not clear whether laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is better than open distal pancreatectomy in terms of earlier recovery after operation. We sought to resolve this issue by searching the medical literature for studies on this topic until June 2015. 
Study characteristics 
No randomised controlled trials have examined this topic. Randomised controlled trials are the best studies for finding out whether one treatment is better or worse than another because they ensure that similar types of people are receiving the treatments being assessed. In the absence of randomised controlled trials, we sought information from non‐randomised studies. We identified 12 non‐randomised studies that compared laparoscopic versus open distal pancreatectomy in a total of 1576 patients. One of these studies did not provide results in a useable way. Thus, we included 11 studies in which a total of 1506 patients underwent distal pancreatectomy. Some 353 patients underwent laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy, and 1153 patients underwent open distal pancreatectomy. In all studies, historical information was collected from hospital records (retrospective studies). In general, historical information is less reliable than newly collected (prospective) information and findings of randomised controlled trials. 
Key results 
Differences in short‐term deaths, long‐term deaths, percentage of people with major complications, percentage of people with a pancreatic fistula (abnormal communication between the pancreas and other organs or the skin), recurrence of cancer at final time of follow‐up of participants, percentage of people with any complications and percentage of patients in whom cancer was not completely removed were imprecise. Average length of hospital stay was shorter in the laparoscopic group than in the open group by about two days. However, this is not relevant until we can be sure that cancer cures are similar between laparoscopic surgery and open surgery. No studies have reported quality of life at any point in time, short‐term recurrence of cancer, time to return to normal activity, time to return to work or blood transfusion requirements. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was very low, mainly because it was not clear whether similar types of participants received laparoscopic and open distal pancreatectomy. In many studies, people with less extensive cancer received laparoscopic surgery, and those with more extensive cancer received open surgery. This makes study findings unreliable. Well‐designed randomised controlled trials are necessary if we are to obtain good quality evidence on this topic. 
","Here is a Plain Language Summary based on the provided abstract.

### **Plain Title**

Is Key-hole Surgery Better Than Open Surgery for Pancreatic Cancer?

### **Rationale**

The pancreas is an organ in your belly. It does two main jobs. It helps your body break down food. It also makes important things like insulin to control your blood sugar.

Sometimes, cancer can grow in the pancreas. This study looked at cancer in the main part or tail end of the pancreas. The best way to try to cure this cancer is to remove it with surgery.

There are two ways to do this surgery. The first is called open surgery. In open surgery, a doctor makes one large cut in the belly to take out the cancer. The second is called key-hole surgery. In key-hole surgery, a doctor makes a few small cuts instead of one large one.

Key-hole surgery is a newer method. For other health problems, it can mean fewer problems after surgery and a shorter hospital stay. Doctors wanted to know if this was also true for pancreatic cancer. They were not sure if key-hole surgery was as safe as open surgery. They also did not know if it was as good at removing all of the cancer. This study was needed to compare the two types of surgery.

### **Trial Design**

To answer their questions, researchers looked for studies that were already done. They searched for all studies that compared key-hole surgery with open surgery for people with pancreatic cancer.

The researchers found 11 studies they could use. These studies included about 1500 people in total. All these people had cancer in the body or tail of their pancreas. They all had surgery to remove it.

In these studies, about 350 people had key-hole surgery. The other 1150 people had open surgery. All the studies the researchers found were based on looking back at old hospital records. This is not the best way to get information, as it can be less reliable. The best type of study follows people from the start, but the researchers could not find any of those.

### **Results**

The researchers found that there were no clear differences between the two surgeries for most of the important results. They looked at how many people had serious problems after surgery. They also looked at how many people died soon after surgery or a long time later. The results for these things were very similar for both groups.

It was also not clear if one surgery was better at removing all of the cancer. There was no clear difference in the cancer coming back later on.

The main difference was how long people stayed in the hospital. People who had key-hole surgery went home about two days earlier than those who had open surgery. But the researchers believe we cannot say key-hole surgery is better because of this. The most important goal is to cure the cancer. We still do not know for sure if both surgeries are equally good at doing that.

The studies did not give information on other important things. For example, they did not report on how people felt after their surgery. They also did not say how long it took for people to get back to their normal life or to work.

The researchers concluded that the information we have right now is of very low quality. This is because the people in the two surgery groups were often very different. Many studies gave key-hole surgery to people with smaller cancers. They gave open surgery to people with larger, more difficult cancers. This makes it unfair to compare them. We need new and better-designed studies to get a clear answer on which surgery is best.","Key‐hole (laparoscopic) versus standard access (open) abdominal operation for people with pancreatic cancer

What is the aim of this review? 
This review aims to determine benefits and harms of all‐trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in addition to chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone for adults with AML. We did not evaluate participants with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found eight studies. 
Key messages 
The addition of ATRA to chemotherapy did not show relevant differences in terms of overall survival (OS), but the subgroup analyses showed that there is potential benefit for ATRA in combination with a certain chemotherapeutic called decitabine , for older patients (over 60 years) and for patients who already had successful chemotherapy and now receive therapy for maintenance. We assessed the certainty of evidence as moderate for OS, disease‐free‐survival and on‐study mortality. 
Rates of toxicities were low, therefore certainty of evidence is 'very low' to 'low' for the adverse events diarrhoea, nausea/vomiting and cardiac toxicity. For the adverse event infection, we judged the certainty of evidence as moderate. Currently, it seems the risk of adverse events with additional ATRA are comparable to chemotherapy only. 
Quality of life was not reported by any of the included trials.
What was studied in this review? 
Acute myeloid leukaemia is a life‐threatening type of cancer that starts in the blood‐forming cells of the bone marrow and can cause many different signs and symptoms. It is classified into several subtypes, of which one subtype, acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) is treated differently to the other subtypes. 
Almost 60% of patients are older than 65 years at the time of diagnosis. Because of advanced age and accompanying diseases an intensive therapy with high‐dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation often is not possible or is accompanied by high risks for serious adverse events and treatment‐related mortality. For these reasons it would be important to know a less intensive and dangerous therapy for older patients. 
All‐trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an intermediate product of vitamin A, had been integrated into treatment regimens for APL by the end of the 1980s. It is administered orally and is generally well tolerated but can induce a severe, life‐threatening complication called differentiation syndrome, which includes breathing difficulties and fever. 
The literature provides contradictory data about the benefit of ATRA for patients with AML. It has been reported to increase the sensitivity of AML cell lines to chemotherapy by reducing one protein, which is associated with poor response to chemotherapy and therefore is related to a poor prognosis.These reports have led to the assumption that ATRA added to chemotherapy may improve outcomes and might replace or reduce the intensity of chemotherapy for patients with AML. 
What are the main results of this review? 
We found eight relevant studies with almost 4000 patients in total, conducted in the UK, Germany and France. These studies compared chemotherapy in combination with ATRA with chemotherapy alone in adult patients (over 18 years) with AML. All the included trials used different chemotherapy schedules, as there are several types of chemotherapy regimens for AML. Only in one trial did participants receive a newer drug, decitabine, which has been licensed for the treatment of AML since 2012. 
Adding ATRA to chemotherapy probably makes little or no difference to OS. ATRA may be potentially beneficial in combination with decitabine, for older patients (over 60 years) and for patients who receive therapy for maintenance, but these findings need to be explored by further research. 
For disease‐free‐survival, complete response rate and on‐study mortality there was probably no or little difference between treatment groups. 
The combination of ATRA probably did not lead to a higher infection rate. Regarding cardiac toxicity and diarrhoea, the certainty of the evidence was assessed as very low, so we are uncertain whether the addition of ATRA is beneficial. 
Quality of life was not reported by any of the included trials.
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We searched for studies that had been published up to July 2018.
","Here is the Plain Language Summary based on the provided abstract.

### **Plain Title**

Does adding a drug related to vitamin A to cancer treatment help adults with a type of blood cancer?

### **Rationale**

Acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, is a serious cancer of the blood. It starts in the bone marrow, where blood cells are made. AML can make people feel very sick.

About 6 out of 10 people with AML are older than 65. Strong cancer treatments, like high-dose chemotherapy, can be very hard on older people. These treatments can have high risks and cause serious health problems. Because of this, doctors are looking for safer and better treatments for them.

This study looked at a drug called ATRA. ATRA is related to vitamin A and comes as a pill. Doctors already use it to treat a different type of blood cancer. Some early studies suggested that ATRA might help chemotherapy work better against AML cancer cells. Researchers wanted to know if adding ATRA to chemotherapy could help people with AML live longer or have fewer side effects.

### **Trial Design**

This was a review study. This means researchers did not do a new experiment. Instead, they gathered and looked at the results from eight past studies. This helped them see what all the studies found when put together.

The studies included almost 4000 adults who were 18 years or older. All of them had AML.

The studies compared two groups of patients:
*   One group received standard chemotherapy medicines to treat their cancer.
*   The other group received the same chemotherapy plus the ATRA pill.

The researchers looked at studies that were published up to July 2018 to get the most recent information at that time.

### **Results**

The main results of this review were:

*   **Living longer:** For most patients, adding ATRA to chemotherapy did not seem to help them live longer.
*   **Possible benefit for some:** The review did find that ATRA might help a few specific groups of patients. It may have helped older patients (over 60 years old). It may have also helped patients who were taking a specific chemotherapy drug called decitabine. More research is needed to be sure about this.
*   **Cancer coming back:** Adding ATRA did not seem to change how long people lived without the cancer returning.
*   **Side effects:** The risk of health problems, or side effects, seemed to be about the same for both groups. People who took ATRA did not get more infections than those who did not. For other side effects like heart problems or diarrhea, there was not enough good information to be sure.
*   **Quality of life:** None of the eight studies reported on how the treatment affected a person’s quality of life, such as their pain, energy, or mood.

In conclusion, the researchers found that adding ATRA to chemotherapy probably does not help most adults with AML. While it may offer a benefit to some smaller groups of patients, more studies must be done to confirm this.","Treatment with all‐trans retinoic acid in addition to chemotherapy for adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (non‐APL)

Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It is the third leading cause of neonatal mortality globally constituting 13% of overall neonatal mortality. Despite the high burden of neonatal sepsis, high‐quality evidence in diagnosis and treatment is scarce. Possibly due to the diagnostic challenges of sepsis and the relative immunosuppression of the newborn, many neonates receive antibiotics for suspected sepsis. Antibiotics have become the most used therapeutics in neonatal intensive care units. The last Cochrane Review was updated in 2004. Given the clinical importance, an updated systematic review assessing the effects of different antibiotic regimens for early‐onset neonatal sepsis is needed. 
Objectives
To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of different antibiotic regimens for early‐onset neonatal sepsis. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 8); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase Ovid; CINAHL; LILACS; Science Citation Index EXPANDED and Conference Proceedings Citation Index – Science on 12 March 2021. We searched clinical trials databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing different antibiotic regimens for early‐onset neonatal sepsis. We included participants from birth to 72 hours of life at randomisation. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Our primary outcome was all‐cause mortality, and our secondary outcomes were: serious adverse events, respiratory support, circulatory support, nephrotoxicity, neurological developmental impairment, necrotising enterocolitis, and ototoxicity. Our primary time point of interest was at maximum follow‐up. 
Main results
We included five RCTs (865 participants). All trials were at high risk of bias. The certainty of the evidence according to GRADE was very low. The included trials assessed five different comparisons of antibiotics. 
We did not conduct any meta‐analyses due to lack of relevant data.
Of the five included trials one trial compared ampicillin plus gentamicin with benzylpenicillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared piperacillin plus tazobactam with amikacin; one trial compared ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid with piperacillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared piperacillin with ampicillin plus amikacin; and one trial compared ceftazidime with benzylpenicillin plus gentamicin. 
None of the five comparisons found any evidence of a difference when assessing all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events, circulatory support, nephrotoxicity, neurological developmental impairment, or necrotising enterocolitis; however, none of the trials were near an information size that could contribute significantly to the evidence of the comparative benefits and risks of any particular antibiotic regimen. 
None of the trials assessed respiratory support or ototoxicity.
The benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens remain unclear due to the lack of well‐powered trials and the high risk of systematic errors. 
Authors' conclusions
Current evidence is insufficient to support any antibiotic regimen being superior to another. Large RCTs assessing different antibiotic regimens in early‐onset neonatal sepsis with low risk of bias are warranted.

Which Drugs Work Best for Blood Infections in Newborn Babies? A Review of Past Studies

### **Rationale**

A serious blood infection in a newborn baby is called neonatal sepsis. This is a very dangerous illness that can make a baby very sick. Sadly, it is one of the main reasons that newborn babies die around the world.

Doctors use strong drugs called antibiotics to fight these infections. But there are many different types of antibiotics. Doctors are not sure which mix of drugs is the best and safest one for a newborn baby. The last big review of research on this topic was done many years ago. So, we needed to do a new review to look at all the newer studies.

Our goal was to compare different antibiotic treatments for newborn babies. We wanted to find out which ones work best to save lives. We also wanted to know which ones cause the fewest harmful side effects.

### **Trial Design**

This study did not treat new patients. Instead, we did what is called a ""systematic review"". This means we searched for all the best studies that had already been done on this topic. We then looked at their results together.

We looked for a special type of study that is the best way to compare treatments fairly. In these studies, babies are put into different groups by chance. Each group gets a different antibiotic treatment. The doctors then see which group does better. We only looked at studies that included newborn babies who were up to 3 days old.

We mainly wanted to see if one treatment was better than another at preventing death. We also looked for other serious problems. These problems included the need for breathing support, kidney damage, brain problems, or serious gut problems.

### **Results**

Our search found 5 studies to include in our review. In total, these studies had 865 babies in them. Each of the 5 studies compared a different mix of antibiotic drugs.

However, we found some problems with these studies. They were not designed very well. This means we cannot fully trust their results. The studies were also too small to give strong answers. Because of these problems, we are not very sure about what the studies found.

The main result was that no single antibiotic treatment was proven to be better than another. No treatment was clearly better at saving a baby's life. The studies also did not show that one treatment was safer than another. We still do not have clear proof about the benefits and harms of these drugs.

The authors of this review concluded that we still do not know the best way to treat blood infections in newborn babies. Right now, there is not enough good proof to say one antibiotic mix is better than any other. We need new and better studies to find the answers. These new studies must be much larger and be very well-designed.","Antibiotic regimens for early‐onset neonatal sepsis
Review question 
We reviewed available evidence on different antibiotic regimens for newborns (from birth to 72 hours of life), with early‐onset sepsis (as defined by trialists). 
Background 
Sepsis in newborns is a severe and potential lethal condition, caused by the body's response to an infection. Neonatal sepsis is the third leading cause of neonatal death globally. Despite the high burden of sepsis in newborns, high‐quality evidence in diagnosis and treatment is scarce. This Cochrane Review was originally published in 2004. To identify the most appropriate antibiotic policies for neonatal sepsis, there is a need to base these policies on an updated well‐conducted review. Given the clinical importance, such a review assessing the effects of different antibiotic regimens for early‐onset neonatal sepsis is needed. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to August 2020. We included five trials randomising 865 participants. The included trials compared five different antibiotic regimens. 
Key results 
We included five trials: one trial compared ampicillin plus gentamicin with benzylpenicillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared piperacillin plus tazobactam with amikacin; one trial compared ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid with piperacillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared piperacillin with ampicillin plus amikacin; and one trial compared ceftazidime with benzylpenicillin plus gentamicin. 
None of the five comparisons showed any difference when assessing death from all causes, serious adverse events (i.e. major complications), respiratory support, circulatory support, nephrotoxicity (toxicity in the kidneys), neurological developmental impairment (disabilities in the functioning of the brain that affect a child's behaviour, memory, or ability to learn), necrotising enterocolitis (tissues in the gut become inflamed and start to die), or ototoxicity (toxic to the ear). Current evidence cannot confirm or reject one antibiotic regimen being superior to another. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence behind our conclusions is very‐low quality. The five trials had high risk of bias (i.e. the trials were conducted in a way that may have skewed results to the positive side). In addition, the five trials included few participants, making the results of this review imprecise.

Respiratory disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF), and many different therapies are used by people with CF in the management of respiratory problems. Bronchodilator therapy is used to relieve symptoms of shortness of breath and to open the airways to allow clearance of mucus. Despite the widespread use of inhaled bronchodilators in CF, there is little objective evidence of their efficacy. A Cochrane Review looking at both short‐ and long‐acting inhaled bronchodilators for CF was withdrawn from the Cochrane Library in 2016. That review has been replaced by two separate Cochrane Reviews: one on long‐acting inhaled bronchodilators for CF, and this review on short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators for CF. For this review 'inhaled' includes the use of pressurised metered dose inhalers (MDIs), with or without a spacer, dry powder devices and nebulisers. 
Objectives
To evaluate short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators in children and adults with CF in terms of clinical outcomes and safety. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books on 28 March 2022 and searched trial registries for any new or ongoing trials on 12 April 2022. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. 
Selection criteria
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs that looked at the effect of any short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator delivered by any device, at any dose, at any frequency and for any duration compared to either placebo or another short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator in people with CF. We screened references as per standard Cochrane methodology. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool. Where we were not able to enter data into our analyses we reported results directly from the papers. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 11 trials from our systematic search, with 191 participants meeting our inclusion criteria; three of these trials had three treatment arms. Eight trials compared short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists to placebo and four trials compared short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists to placebo. Three trials compared short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists to short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists. All were cross‐over trials with only small numbers of participants. We were only able to enter data into the analysis from three trials comparing short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists to placebo. 
Short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists versus placebo 
All eight trials (six single‐dose trials and two longer‐term trials) reporting on this comparison reported on forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), either as per cent predicted (% predicted) or L. We were able to combine the data from two trials in a meta‐analysis which showed a greater per cent change from baseline in FEV1 L after beta‐2 agonists compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) 6.95%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88 to 12.02; 2 trials, 82 participants). Only one of the longer‐term trials reported on exacerbations, as measured by hospitalisations and courses of antibiotics. Only the second longer‐term trial presented results for participant‐reported outcomes. Three trials narratively reported adverse events, and these were all mild. Three single‐dose trials and the two longer trials reported on forced vital capacity (FVC), and five trials reported on peak expiratory flow, i.e. forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% (FEF25-75). One trial reported on airway clearance in terms of sputum weight. We judged the certainty of evidence for each of these outcomes to be very low, meaning we are very uncertain about the effect of short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists on any of the outcomes we assessed. 
Short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists versus placebo 
All four trials reporting on this comparison looked at the effects of ipratropium bromide, but in different doses and via different delivery methods. One trial reported FEV1 % predicted; three trials measured this in L. Two trials reported adverse events, but these were few and mild. One trial reported FVC and three trials reported FEF25-75. None of the trials reported on quality of life, exacerbations or airway clearance. We judged the certainty of evidence for each of these outcomes to be very low, meaning we are very uncertain about the effect of short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists on any of the outcomes we assessed. 
Short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists versus short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists  
None of the three single‐dose trials reporting on this comparison provided data we could analyse. The original papers from three trials report that both treatments lead to an improvement in FEV1 L. Only one trial reported on adverse events; but none were experienced by any participant. No trial reported on any of our other outcomes. We judged the certainty of evidence to be very low, meaning we are very uncertain about the effect of short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists compared to short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists on any of the outcomes we assessed. 
Authors' conclusions
All included trials in this review are small and of a cross‐over design. Most trials looked at very short‐term effects of inhaled bronchodilators, and therefore did not measure longer‐term outcomes. The certainty of evidence across all outcomes was very low, and therefore we have been unable to describe any effects with certainty.

### **Plain Title**

Do Short-Term Inhalers Help People with Cystic Fibrosis Breathe Better? A Review of Past Studies

### **Rationale**

**What is cystic fibrosis?**

Cystic fibrosis, or CF, is a health condition that people are born with. It causes the body to make very thick and sticky mucus. This mucus can build up in the lungs. The buildup of mucus can make it hard to breathe. It can also cause serious lung infections and damage over time.

**How do doctors treat breathing problems in CF?**

To help with breathing, doctors often give people with CF medicines called bronchodilators. People breathe these medicines in using an inhaler. The medicine helps to open up the airways in the lungs. This can make it easier to breathe and cough up the thick mucus. These medicines are also called ""short-acting"" because they work quickly but for a short time.

**Why was this study needed?**

Many people with CF use these short-term inhalers every day. But we do not have strong proof that they really help people with CF in the long run. Researchers wanted to find out if these medicines truly work and if they are safe. To do this, they looked at all the past research studies on this topic to see what they could learn.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, the researchers did a review of studies that were already completed. They searched for all the studies that looked at short-term inhalers for people with CF.

The researchers looked for studies that compared these inhalers to a fake inhaler, called a placebo. A placebo looks like a real medicine but has no drug in it. They also looked for studies that compared two different types of short-term inhalers with each other.

The studies in this review included 191 people in total. The people in the studies were children and adults with CF. Most of the studies they found were small. They also only tested the medicine for a very short time. Some studies only looked at the effects of a single dose.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The main finding was that the proof from past studies is very weak. This means the researchers are very unsure about the real effects of these short-term inhalers for people with CF.

**One type of inhaler compared to a fake inhaler**

*   Some studies showed that one type of inhaler might cause a small improvement in a breathing test. This test measures how much air a person can blow out of their lungs in one second.
*   However, the proof was not strong. The researchers are very uncertain about this result.
*   The studies reported only a few mild side effects, like a cough or a bad taste.
*   These studies did not check important things, like if the medicine made people feel better or if it stopped them from getting sick.

**Another type of inhaler compared to a fake inhaler**

*   The researchers also looked at a different type of short-term inhaler.
*   Again, they found that the proof was too weak to know for sure if this medicine helped people breathe better.
*   Very few side effects were reported in these studies.
*   These studies also did not report on how the medicine affected people's daily lives.

**Comparing the two types of inhalers**

*   Three very small studies compared the two types of inhalers.
*   The studies showed that both medicines seemed to help with breathing tests. But the information was not clear enough to say if one worked better than the other.
*   One study checked for side effects and found that no one had any.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

All the studies found in this review were very small. They also only looked at how the medicines worked over a very short time. Because of this, the researchers could not make strong conclusions.

We still do not have clear proof that short-term inhalers help people with CF. We also do not know which type of inhaler might be best. The researchers believe that new and bigger studies are needed. These future studies should follow people for a longer time. This will help us learn the true benefits and safety of these common medicines for people with CF.","Short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators for cystic fibrosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for using short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators (treatments which widen and open the airways, making it easier to breathe) in people with cystic fibrosis. Short‐acting bronchodilators take effect quickly and generally last 4 to 6 hours. We were interested in any type of short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator, given at any dose, and by any type of device (inhalers or nebulisers). 
Both nebulisers and inhalers deliver medicine. Nebulisers turn liquid medication into an easily‐inhaled mist. They vary in type but need a power source, e.g. a rechargeable battery, to function. Inhalers deliver short bursts of medicine (as an aerosol or dry powder) via a manual handheld device. The most common type of inhaler is a metered‐dose inhaler. Inhalers can be used with spacers (empty tubes, usually made from plastic that slot onto the mouthpiece of the inhaler).  
Inhaled bronchodilators are used by many people with cystic fibrosis to help them breathe, and to make it easier to clear mucus from their lungs. We wanted to know if these treatments were better than a placebo (dummy) treatment or another type of short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to 28 March 2022.
Trial characteristics 
The review included 11 trials with 191 people with cystic fibrosis aged between 5 and 40 years of age. Trials compared two different types of short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator (beta‐2 agonists such as salbutamol or albuterol, and muscarinic antagonists such as ipratropium bromide) against a placebo substance which contained no medication, or a different short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator; three of the trials had three comparison groups ‐ beta‐2 agonists versus muscarinic antagonists versus placebo. All trials were cross‐over trials, so all of the people included in the trial received both treatments at different times, and the order that they received the treatments was random. The trials lasted from a single‐dose trial to 6 months. Eight trials looked at the effects of short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists versus placebo, four trials at the effects of a short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonist versus placebo, and three trials looked at the effects of a short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonist with a short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonist. 
Key results 
All trials looked at the effect of short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators on lung function, measured as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), but this was reported in different ways and at different time points.  
We are uncertain whether any of the short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators have an effect on FEV1 compared to placebo. The trials were too small and there were not enough data to show if there was an effect or not. 
Only six of the 11 trials reported on harmful effects of treatment: one trial reported no harmful effects and five trials reported mild tremors, dry mouth and fatigue. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence across all trials was very low. All trials used a cross‐over design where the participants are given one treatment and then swapped to the other treatment with a washout period (the length of time for a drug to be eliminated from the body) in between. It is possible that the clinical status of participants was not the same at the beginning of the first treatment phase as at the beginning of the second treatment phase. The trials were also very small and were carried out more than 10 years ago.

10.1002-14651858.CD013400.pub2,"Physical activity interventions for people with congenital heart disease
Review question
This review aimed to gather evidence for the use of any physical activity intervention for people with congenital heart disease. We aimed to compare interventions including exercise training, physical activity promotion or lung training with no intervention (usual care). 
Background
Congenital heart disease is the term used for a range of birth defects that affect how the heart works. People with congenital heart disease have reduced life expectancy, physical fitness and quality of life. However, due to better prenatal diagnoses, surgical procedures (often performed in the early years of life) and earlier interventions, the survival rate for those born with this disease has improved dramatically, such that most people will now live into adulthood. Exercise training and physical activity interventions are known to improve fitness, physical activity, survival and quality of life in healthy people, but it is not clear how effective these programmes are for people with long‐term medical conditions. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies in September 2019 and identified 15 studies involving 924 participants. The studies used three main types of interventions, including programmes designed to increase physical activity, aerobic fitness and health‐related quality of life and compared physical activity intervention and control interventions in people with congenital heart disease.  
Key results
We included 15 trials with 924 participants. Half of the participants were female. Of the 15 trials, 5 used a total of 500 young people (less than 18 years of age) and 10 trials used a total of 424 adult participants. We found that physical fitness and physical activity may slightly increase but we are very uncertain about quality of life. There is currently no data to say if this small increase in fitness will result in fewer visits to the hospital. But there were no recorded deaths or serious events that were related to participation in physical activity. 
Quality of evidence
Using a validated scientific approach (GRADE), the certainty in the evidence base was moderate for fitness, low for physical activity and very low for quality of life. Most outcomes were limited due to small study participant numbers and poor reporting of study details.

Can Exercise Help People Born with Heart Problems?

**Rationale**

Some people are born with a heart that does not work in the usual way. This is called congenital heart disease. It means there was a problem with the heart’s shape or parts before the baby was born. This can affect a person’s health. They may not be as fit as other people. It can also affect how they feel about their daily life.

Today, doctors are much better at finding and treating these heart problems. Many surgeries are done when people are very young. This means most people born with a heart problem now live long lives as adults.

We know that being active is good for healthy people. Exercise can improve their fitness and help them feel better. But we did not know if exercise is helpful and safe for people born with heart problems. Researchers wanted to find out. They looked at past studies to see if exercise programs can help these people be more fit and active.

**Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers did a review. This means they looked for all the studies that had already been done on this topic. They gathered the results from all these studies to get a bigger picture.

The researchers found 15 studies to review. In total, 924 people with congenital heart disease took part in these studies. About half of the people were women. Five studies looked at a total of 500 young people under 18 years old. The other 10 studies looked at a total of 424 adults.

In each study, people were put into two groups. One group took part in an exercise program. These programs were designed to help people be more active and improve their fitness. The other group did not do an exercise program. They just continued with their normal doctor’s care. The researchers then compared the two groups.

**Results**

The review of the 15 studies showed a few key things. People who took part in the exercise programs may have become a little more fit. They may have also become a little more active in their daily lives. The researchers are not sure if these programs helped people feel better about their overall quality of life.

A very important finding was about safety. In all the studies, being active was safe. No one had any serious health problems from taking part in the exercise programs. This is good news for people with congenital heart disease who want to be more active.

The researchers also looked at how strong the proof was. They are somewhat sure that exercise can slightly improve fitness. They are less sure if it helps people be more active. They are not at all sure if exercise helps people feel better about their lives. This is because many of the studies were small. They did not have many people in them. Some studies also did not share enough detail. This makes it hard to be certain about the results.

The main conclusion is that exercise seems to be safe. It might help a little with physical fitness. But we need more and bigger studies to know for sure how much exercise can help.","Physical activity interventions for people with congenital heart disease

10.1002-14651858.CD013756.pub2,"Background
Implanted spinal neuromodulation (SNMD) techniques are used in the treatment of refractory chronic pain. They involve the implantation of electrodes around the spinal cord (spinal cord stimulation (SCS)) or dorsal root ganglion (dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRGS)), and a pulse generator unit under the skin. Electrical stimulation is then used with the aim of reducing pain intensity. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy, effectiveness, adverse events, and cost‐effectiveness of implanted spinal neuromodulation interventions for people with chronic pain. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, Web of Science (ISI), Health Technology Assessments, ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry from inception to September 2021 without language restrictions, searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SNMD interventions with placebo (sham) stimulation, no treatment or usual care; or comparing SNMD interventions + another treatment versus that treatment alone. We included participants ≥ 18 years old with non‐cancer and non‐ischaemic pain of longer than three months duration. Primary outcomes were pain intensity and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were disability, analgesic medication use, health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) and health economic outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened database searches to determine inclusion, extracted data and evaluated risk of bias for prespecified results using the Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. Outcomes were evaluated at short‐ (≤ one month), medium‐ four to eight months) and long‐term (≥12 months). Where possible we conducted meta‐analyses. We used the GRADE system to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We included 15 unique published studies that randomised 908 participants, and 20 unique ongoing studies. All studies evaluated SCS. We found no eligible published studies of DRGS and no studies comparing SCS with no treatment or usual care. We rated all results evaluated as being at high risk of bias overall. For all comparisons and outcomes where we found evidence, we graded the certainty of the evidence as low or very low, downgraded due to limitations of studies, imprecision and in some cases, inconsistency. 
Active stimulation versus placebo  
SCS versus placebo (sham)  
Results were only available at short‐term follow‐up for this comparison.
Pain intensity 
Six studies (N = 164) demonstrated a small effect in favour of SCS at short‐term follow‐up (0 to 100 scale, higher scores = worse pain, mean difference (MD) ‐8.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐15.67 to ‐1.78, very low certainty). The point estimate falls below our predetermined threshold for a clinically important effect (≥10 points). No studies reported the proportion of participants experiencing 30% or 50% pain relief for this comparison. 
Adverse events (AEs) 
The quality and inconsistency of adverse event reporting in these studies precluded formal analysis. 
Active stimulation + other intervention versus other intervention alone  
SCS + other intervention versus other intervention alone (open‐label studies)  
Pain intensity 
Mean difference  
Three studies (N = 303) demonstrated a potentially clinically important mean difference in favour of SCS of ‐37.41 at short term (95% CI ‐46.39 to ‐28.42, very low certainty), and medium‐term follow‐up (5 studies, 635 participants, MD ‐31.22 95% CI ‐47.34 to ‐15.10 low‐certainty), and no clear evidence for an effect of SCS at long‐term follow‐up (1 study, 44 participants, MD ‐7 (95% CI ‐24.76 to 10.76, very low‐certainty). 
Proportion of participants reporting ≥50% pain relief  
We found an effect in favour of SCS at short‐term (2 studies, N = 249, RR 15.90, 95% CI 6.70 to 37.74, I2 0% ; risk difference (RD) 0.65 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.74, very low certainty), medium term (5 studies, N = 597, RR 7.08, 95 %CI 3.40 to 14.71, I2 = 43%; RD 0.43, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.73, low‐certainty evidence), and long term (1 study, N = 87, RR 15.15, 95% CI 2.11 to 108.91 ; RD 0.35, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.49, very low certainty) follow‐up. 
Adverse events (AEs) 
Device related  
No studies specifically reported  device‐related adverse events at short‐term follow‐up. At medium‐term follow‐up, the incidence of lead failure/displacement (3 studies N = 330) ranged from 0.9 to 14% (RD 0.04, 95% CI ‐0.04 to 0.11, I2 64%, very low certainty). The incidence of infection (4 studies, N = 548) ranged from 3 to 7% (RD 0.04, 95%CI 0.01, 0.07, I2 0%, very low certainty). The incidence of reoperation/reimplantation (4 studies, N =5 48) ranged from 2% to 31% (RD 0.11, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.21, I2 86%, very low certainty). One study (N = 44) reported a 55% incidence of lead failure/displacement (RD 0.55, 95% CI 0.35, 0 to 75, very low certainty), and a 94% incidence of reoperation/reimplantation (RD 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.07, very low certainty) at five‐year follow‐up. No studies provided data on infection rates at long‐term follow‐up. 
We found reports of some serious adverse events as a result of the intervention. These included autonomic neuropathy, prolonged hospitalisation, prolonged monoparesis, pulmonary oedema, wound infection, device extrusion and one death resulting from subdural haematoma. 
Other  
No studies reported the incidence of other adverse events at short‐term follow‐up. We found no clear evidence of a difference in otherAEs at medium‐term (2 studies, N = 278, RD ‐0.05, 95% CI ‐0.16 to 0.06, I2 0%) or long term (1 study, N = 100, RD ‐0.17, 95% CI ‐0.37 to 0.02) follow‐up. 
Very limited evidence suggested that SCS increases healthcare costs. It was not clear whether SCS was cost‐effective. 
Authors' conclusions
We found very low‐certainty evidence that SCS may not provide clinically important benefits on pain intensity compared to placebo stimulation. We found low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence that SNMD interventions may provide clinically important benefits for pain intensity when added to conventional medical management or physical therapy. SCS is associated with complications including infection, electrode lead failure/migration and a need for reoperation/re‐implantation. The level of certainty regarding the size of those risks is very low. SNMD may lead to serious adverse events, including death. We found no evidence to support or refute the use of DRGS for chronic pain.

A Review of Spine Devices for Long-Term Pain

**Rationale**

**What is long-term pain?**
Some people live with pain for a long time. This is called chronic or long-term pain. It can last for months or years. This pain can make it hard to do daily tasks, work, or enjoy life. Often, common treatments do not help enough.

**How could a spine device help?**
One treatment for long-term pain is a special device. It is called a spinal cord stimulator. A doctor places this small device under the skin. Thin wires connect the device to the spine. The device sends gentle electrical signals to the nerves. These signals aim to block pain messages from reaching the brain.

**Why was this study done?**
Doctors and patients need to know if these devices work well. They also need to know if they are safe. Researchers wanted to find out by looking at all the best studies that have been done on these devices. This review helps us understand the true benefits and risks.

**Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**
This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers gathered and reviewed past studies. They looked for studies that were done in a fair way. In those studies, people were chosen by chance to get a treatment or not. This is the best way to compare treatments.

The researchers looked at 15 completed studies. A total of 908 adults were in these studies. All the people had long-term pain that was not caused by cancer or problems with blood flow.

The studies compared the spine device in two main ways:
1.  A working device was compared to a fake device that was turned off.
2.  A working device plus usual care was compared to usual care alone. Usual care could be things like physical therapy or pain medicine.

Researchers checked the results at different times. They looked at results from the first month. They also looked at results from 4 to 8 months later, and after one year or more.

**Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**
The researchers found that the quality of the past studies was not very good. This means we cannot be very sure about the results. More research is needed to be certain.

**Did the device work better than a fake device?**
When compared to a fake device, the real device helped only a little with pain. This was only for the first month. The amount of pain relief was likely too small to make a real difference in a person's life.

**Did the device help when added to other care?**
When the device was added to other treatments, it seemed to help more. People who used the device had much less pain for the first few months. But after a year, it was not clear if the device was still helping.

Also, many more people who used the device said their pain was cut in half. This was true even after a year.

**What were the side effects and risks?**
The spine device has risks. Some people had problems with the device itself.
*   The wires could move or break.
*   About 3 to 7 out of 100 people got an infection where the device was placed.
*   Many people needed more surgery to fix the device. In one study, more than half of the people needed another surgery to fix the wires.

Some people had very serious problems. These included long stays in the hospital, muscle weakness, and fluid in the lungs. Sadly, one person died because of a problem from the surgery.

**What did the researchers conclude?**
*   We are not sure if the spine device offers real benefits for long-term pain.
*   It may help lower pain for some people when used with other treatments. But this benefit may not last.
*   The device comes with serious risks. These include infections, parts breaking, and the need for more surgery.

Patients should talk with their doctors about all the possible benefits and risks. This can help them decide if this treatment is right for them. More and better studies are needed.","What are the benefits and risks of electrical spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion stimulation for the treatment of chronic pain in adults? 
Why this question is important 
Persistent (chronic) pain is a common problem that affects people from all walks of life. It can be the result of a wide range of different medical conditions and is sometimes unexplained, but it often causes substantial suffering, distress and disability and can have major impacts on a person's quality of life. 
Implanted spinal neuromodulation (SNMD) interventions involve surgically implanting wires (electrodes) into the space around nerves or the spinal cord that are connected to a ""pulse generator"" device which is usually implanted under the patient's skin. This delivers electrical stimulation to the nerves or spinal cord. It is thought that this stimulation interferes with danger messages being sent to the spinal cord and brain with the goal of reducing the perception of pain. Once implanted with a SNMD device people live with the device implanted, potentially on a permanent basis. We reviewed the evidence to find out whether these interventions were effective at reducing pain, disability and medication use, at improving quality of life and to find out the risk and type of complications they might cause. There are two broad types of SNMD: spinal cord stimulation (SCS), where electrodes are placed near the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRGS) where electrodes are placed near the nerve root, where the nerve branches off from the spinal cord. 
How we identified and assessed the evidence 
First, we searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed the certainty of the evidence. We considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we rated the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. 
What we found 
We found 15 published studies that included 908 people with persistent pain due to a variety of causes including nerve disease, chronic low back pain, chronic neck pain and complex regional pain syndrome. All of these studies evaluated SCS; no studies evaluated DRGS. 
Eight studies (that included 205 people) compared SCS with a sham (placebo) stimulation, where the electrodes were implanted, but no stimulation was delivered. Six studies that included 684 people compared SCS added with either medical management or physical therapy with medical management or physical therapy on its own. We rated the evidence as being of low, or very low certainty. Limitations in how the studies were conducted and reported, the amount of evidence we found and inconsistency between studies in some instances means that our confidence in the results is limited. 
The evidence suggests the following.
Compared to receiving medical management or physical therapy alone, people treated with the addition of SCS may experience less pain and higher quality of life after one month or six months of stimulation. There is limited evidence to draw conclusions in the long term of one year or more. It is unclear whether SCS reduces disability or medication use. 
Compared to a sham (placebo) stimulation, SCS may result in small reductions in pain intensity in the short term that may not be clinically important, but this is currently unclear. There is no evidence at medium or long‐term follow‐up points. 
SCS can result in complications. These include movement or malfunction of the electrode wires, wound infections and the need for further surgical procedures to fix issues with the implanted devices. We also found instances of serious complications that included one death, nerve damage, lasting muscle weakness, lung injury, serious infection, prolonged hospital stay and the extrusion of a stimulation device through the skin. 
Very limited evidence around the costs and economics of SCS suggested that SCS increases the costs of healthcare. It was not clear whether SCS was cost‐effective. 
What this means 
SCS may reduce pain intensity in people with chronic pain. It is currently not clear how much of this effect is due to the SCS itself and how much is due to so‐called ""placebo"" effects, which are the result of the experience of undergoing the procedure and the person's expectations that it will help them. Receiving SCS does present a risk of relatively common complications and less common serious complications. We are currently unsure of the precise degree of this risk. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence in this review is current to September 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD014953.pub2,"Background
Cataract surgery is the most common incisional surgical procedure in ophthalmology and is important in ophthalmic graduate medical education. Although most ophthalmology training programs in the United States (US) include virtual reality (VR) training for cataract surgery, comprehensive reviews that detail the impact of VR training on ophthalmology trainee performance are lacking. 
Objectives
To assess the impact of VR training for cataract surgery on the operating performance of postgraduate ophthalmology trainees, measured by operating time, intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, supervising physician ratings, and VR simulator task ratings. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase.com, PubMed, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 14 June 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing VR training to any other method of training, including non‐VR simulation training (e.g., wet laboratory training), didactics training, or no supplementary training in postgraduate ophthalmology trainees. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodology. Primary outcomes were operating times in the operating room and intraoperative complications. Secondary outcomes were operating times in simulated settings, simulator task ratings, and supervising physician ratings, either in the operating room or simulated settings. 
Main results
We included six RCTs with a total of 151 postgraduate ophthalmology trainees ranging from 12 to 60 participants in each study. The included studies varied widely in terms of geography: two in the US, and one study each in China, Germany, India, and Morocco. Three studies compared VR training for phacoemulsification cataract surgery on the Eyesi simulator (VRmagic, Mannheim, Germany) with wet laboratory training and two studies compared VR training with no supplementary training. One study compared trainees who received VR training with those who received conventional training for manual small incision cataract surgery on the HelpMeSee simulator (HelpMeSee, New York, NY). Industry financially supported two studies. All studies had at least three domains judged at high or unclear risks of bias. We did not conduct a meta‐analysis due to insufficient data (i.e., lack of precision measurements, or studies reported only P values). All evidence was very low‐certainty, meaning that any estimates were unreliable. 
The evidence for the benefits of VR training for trainees was very uncertain for primary outcomes. VR‐trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had shorter operating times (mean difference [MD] −17 minutes, 95% confidence interval [CI] −21.62 to −12.38; 1 study, n = 12; very low‐certainty evidence). Results for operating time were inconsistent when comparing VR and wet laboratory training: one study found that VR relative to wet laboratory training was associated with longer operating times (P = 0.038); the other reported that two training groups had similar operating times (P = 0.14). One study reported that VR‐trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had fewer intraoperative complications (P < 0.001); in another study, VR and conventionally trained trainees had similar intraoperative complication rates (MD −8.31, 95% CI −22.78 to 6.16; 1 study, n = 19; very low‐certainty evidence). 
For secondary outcomes, VR training may have similar impact on trainee performance compared to wet laboratory and greater impact compared to no supplementary training, but the evidence was very uncertain. One study reported VR‐trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had significantly reduced operating time in simulated settings (P = 0.0013). Another study reported that VR‐trained relative to wet laboratory‐trained trainees had shorter operating times in VR settings (MD −1.40 minutes, 95% CI −1.96 to −0.84; 1 study, n = 60) and similar times in wet laboratory settings (MD 0.16 minutes, 95% CI −0.50 to 0.82; 1 study, n = 60). This study also found the VR‐trained trainees had higher VR simulator ratings (MD 5.17, 95% CI 0.61 to 9.73; 1 study, n = 60). Results for supervising physician ratings in the operating room were inconsistent: one study reported that VR‐ and wet laboratory‐trained trainees received similar supervising physician ratings for cataract surgery (P = 0.608); another study reported that VR‐trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training were less likely to receive poor ratings by supervising physicians for capsulorhexis construction (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.57). In wet laboratory settings, VR‐trained trainees received similar supervising physician ratings compared with wet laboratory‐trained trainees (MD −1.50, 95% CI −6.77 to 3.77; n = 60) and higher supervising physician ratings compared with trainees without supplementary training (P < 0.0001). However, the results for all secondary outcomes should be interpreted with caution because of very low‐certainty evidence.  
Authors' conclusions
Current research suggests that VR training may be more effective than no supplementary training in improving trainee performance in the operating room and simulated settings for postgraduate ophthalmology trainees, but the evidence is uncertain. The evidence comparing VR with conventional or wet laboratory training was less consistent.

Does Computer Game Training Help New Doctors Learn Eye Surgery?

### **Rationale**

A cataract is a common eye problem, often in older adults. It is when the lens inside your eye becomes cloudy. This can make your vision blurry, like looking through a foggy window. The only way to fix a cataract is with surgery.

Cataract surgery is done very often. Doctors who do this surgery need great training to make sure it is safe for patients. Today, many new eye doctors learn by using a special computer program. This is called virtual reality, or VR. It is like a very realistic video game of the surgery.

This study looked at whether this VR training really helps new doctors. Researchers wanted to know if doctors who use VR for practice become better at the real surgery. They looked at all the past studies on this topic to find the best answer.

### **Trial Design**

This was a review study. This means the researchers did not work with new patients. Instead, they gathered and studied all the past research on this topic. They looked for studies that compared different ways of training new eye doctors for cataract surgery.

The researchers found 6 studies to review. These studies included a total of 151 new eye doctors. The studies came from different countries around the world.

In these studies, new doctors were split into groups. One group used VR to practice the surgery. Other groups got different kinds of training. Some practiced in a lab on animal or fake eyes, called a ""wet lab."" Other groups got no extra training at all. The researchers then compared how well the different groups did.

### **Results**

The researchers found that the 6 studies were not of the best quality. This means we cannot be very sure about the results. The proof from the studies was weak.

**VR training compared to no extra training:**
There was some proof that VR training might be helpful. One study found that doctors who trained on VR were faster during real surgery. It also found they made fewer mistakes.

**VR training compared to lab training:**
When comparing VR training to lab training, the results were not clear. One study found that VR-trained doctors were slower in surgery. Another study found that their surgery times were about the same as doctors with lab training.

**What did the researchers conclude?**
The researchers who did this review have a careful conclusion. They think that VR training may be better than no extra training for new eye doctors. But, the proof is not strong.

It is still not clear if VR training is better than other types of practice, like in a lab. Because the proof is weak, we cannot say for sure which training method is best. The researchers believe we need more and better studies to find a clear answer.","Can virtual reality training for cataract surgery supplement or replace other training methods for ophthalmology trainees? 
Key messagesWe did not find enough evidence to show that virtual reality (VR) training improves cataract surgery performance among ophthalmology trainees compared to wet lab or conventional training. 
What is virtual reality training?VR training uses computer technology to simulate a three‐dimensional interactive environment. 
How does cataract surgery training work in ophthalmology trainees?Most postgraduate ophthalmology trainees in the United States (US) transition gradually from performing specific cataract surgery (replacing the cloudy lens inside the eye with an artificial one) steps in a wet laboratory (practicing on cadaver or artificial tissues) or using VR simulators to performing cataract surgery in the operating room. 
Why is this question important?VR training is becoming increasingly common in postgraduate ophthalmology training, but comprehensive reviews of the impact of VR training on trainees’ cataract surgery performance are lacking. 
What did we want to find out?The primary aim of this review was to determine whether VR training improved operating room performance (measured by operating time in the operating room, intraoperative [during the operation] complications, or postoperative [after the operation] complications) in cataract surgery for postgraduate ophthalmology trainees. The secondary aim was to identify the impact of VR training on operating time in simulated settings, supervising physician ratings in the operating room or simulator settings, or VR simulation task ratings. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?We searched for studies that compared VR training to other training methods such as traditional wet laboratory training or no supplementary training in a postgraduate ophthalmology trainee population. 
What did we find?VR relative to conventional or wet laboratory training did not impact operating times, the rate of intraoperative complications, or supervising physician ratings in the operating room. However, compared to trainees without supplementary training, VR‐trained trainees received higher supervising physician ratings in the operating room. The quality of evidence for all outcomes was very low. 
What does this mean?VR training is a promising intervention for teaching cataract surgery, but more rigorous, evidence‐based studies are needed to gauge its impact on key outcomes such as intraoperative and postoperative complications.  
How up‐to‐date is the evidence?The evidence is current up to 14 June 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013817.pub2,"Background
Glaucoma is a group of optic neuropathies characterized by progressive degeneration of the retinal ganglion cells, axonal loss and irreversible visual field defects. Glaucoma is classified as primary or secondary, and worldwide, primary glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness. Several subtypes of glaucoma exist, and primary open‐angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common. The etiology of POAG is unknown, but current treatments aim to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP), thus preventing the onset and progression of the disease. Compared with traditional antiglaucomatous treatments, rho kinase inhibitors (ROKi) have a different pharmacodynamic. ROKi is the only current treatment that effectively lowers IOP by modulating the drainage of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal. As ROKi are introduced into the market more widely, it is important to assess the efficacy and potential AEs of the treatment. 
Objectives
To compare the efficacy and safety of ROKi with placebo or other glaucoma medication in people diagnosed with open‐angle glaucoma (OAG), primary open‐angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT). 
Search methods
We used standard Cochrane methods and searched databases on 11 December 2020.
Selection criteria
We included randomized clinical trials examining commercially available ROKi‐based monotherapy or combination therapy compared with placebo or other IOP‐lowering medical treatments in people diagnosed with (P)OAG or OHT. We included trials where ROKi were administered according to official glaucoma guidelines. There were no restrictions regarding type, year or status of the publication. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently screened studies, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias by using Cochrane's RoB 2 tool.  
Main results
We included 17 trials with 4953 participants diagnosed with (P)OAG or OHT. Fifteen were multicenter trials and 15 were masked trials. All participants were aged above 18 years. Trial duration varied from 24 hours to 12 months. Trials were conducted in the USA, Canada and Japan. Sixteen trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies, and one trial provided no information about funding sources. The trials compared ROKi monotherapy (netarsudil or ripasudil) or combination therapy with latanoprost (prostaglandin analog) or timolol (beta‐blocker) with placebo, timolol, latanoprost or netarsudil. Reported outcomes were IOP and safety. Meta‐analyses were applied to 13 trials (IOP reduction from baseline) and 15 trials (ocular AEs).  
Of the trials evaluating IOP, seven were at low risk, three had some concerns, and three were at high risk of bias. Three trials found that netarsudil monotherapy may be superior to placebo (mean difference [MD] 3.11 mmHg, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.59 to 3.62; I2 = 0%; 155 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Evidence from three trials found that timolol may be superior to netarsudil with an MD of 0.66 mmHg (95% CI 0.41 to 0.91; I2 = 0%; 1415 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Evidence from four trials found that latanoprost may be superior to netarsudil with an MD of 0.97 mmHg (95% CI 0.67 to 1.27; I2 = 4%; 1283 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
Evidence from three trials showed that, compared with monotherapy with latanoprost, combination therapy with netarsudil and latanoprost probably led to an additional pooled mean IOP reduction from baseline of 1.64 mmHg (95% CI −2.16 to −1.11; 1114 participants). Evidence from three trials showed that, compared with monotherapy with netarsudil, combination therapy with netarsudil and latanoprost probably led to an additional pooled mean IOP reduction from baseline of 2.66 mmHg (95% CI −2.98 to −2.35; 1132 participants). The certainty of evidence was moderate. One trial showed that,  compared with timolol monotherapy, combination therapy with ripasudil and timolol may lead to an IOP reduction from baseline of 0.75 mmHg (95% −1.29 to −CI 0.21; 208 participants). The certainty of evidence was moderate. 
Of the trials assessing total ocular AEs, three were at low risk, four had some concerns, and eight were at high risk of bias.  
We found very low‐certainty evidence that netarsudil may lead to more ocular AEs compared with placebo, with 66 more ocular AEs per 100 person‐months (95% CI 28 to 103; I2 = 86%; 4 trials, 188 participants). We found low‐certainty evidence that netarsudil may lead to more ocular AEs compared with latanoprost, with 29 more ocular AEs per 100 person‐months (95% CI 17 to 42; I2 = 95%; 4 trials, 1286 participants).  
We found moderate‐certainty evidence that, compared with timolol, netarsudil probably led to 21 additional ocular AEs (95% CI 14 to 27; I2 = 93%; 4 trials, 1678 participants). Data from three trials (1132 participants) showed no evidence of differences in the incidence rate of AEs between combination therapy with netarsudil and latanoprost and netarsudil monotherapy (1 more event per 100 person‐months, 95% CI 0 to 3); however, the certainty of evidence was low. Similarly, we found low‐certainty evidence that, compared with latanoprost, combination therapy with netarsudil and latanoprost may cause 29 more ocular events per 100 person‐months (95% CI 11 to 47; 3 trials, 1116 participants). We found moderate‐certainty evidence that, compared with timolol monotherapy, combination therapy with ripasudil and timolol probably causes 35 more ocular events per 100 person‐months (95% CI 25 to 45; 1 trial, 208 participants). In all included trials, ROKi was reportedly not associated with any particular serious AEs. 
Authors' conclusions
The current evidence suggests that in people diagnosed with OHT or (P)OAG, the hypotensive effect of netarsudil may be inferior to latanoprost and slightly inferior to timolol. Combining netarsudil and latanoprost probably further reduces IOP compared with monotherapy. Netarsudil as mono‐ or combination therapy may result in more ocular AEs. However, the certainty of evidence was very low or low for all comparisons except timolol. In general, AEs were described as mild, transient, and reversible upon treatment discontinuation. ROKi was not associated with any particular serious AEs. Future trials of sufficient size and follow‐up should be conducted to provide reliable information about glaucoma progression, relevant IOP measurements and a detailed description of AEs using similar terminology. This would ensure the robustness and confidence of the results and assess the intermediate‐ and long‐term efficacy and safety of ROKi.

Comparing a New Eye Drop for Glaucoma to Older Medicines

### **Rationale**

Glaucoma is an eye disease that hurts the nerve connecting your eye to your brain. Over time, this damage can cause you to lose your sight. This vision loss cannot be fixed.

One of the main causes of glaucoma is high pressure inside the eye. Most treatments for glaucoma work by lowering this eye pressure. This helps protect the nerve in your eye.

There is a new type of eye drop medicine for glaucoma. It is called a rho kinase inhibitor, or ROKi for short. ROKi drugs work in a new way. They help the fluid in the eye drain better, which lowers the pressure.

Since these ROKi drugs are new, doctors need to know more about them. This study looked at how well ROKi drugs work to lower eye pressure. It also looked at their safety and side effects. Researchers compared the new ROKi drugs to older, more common glaucoma medicines and to a fake medicine with no drug in it.

### **Trial Design**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at the results from 17 different studies that were already completed. Looking at many studies at once can give a better overall picture.

These studies included almost 5,000 adults who were 18 years or older. All of them had glaucoma or high pressure in their eyes. The studies took place in the United States, Canada, and Japan.

In the studies, people were put into different groups by chance. Some people used a new ROKi eye drop. Others used older glaucoma eye drops. Some people used a mix of two different eye drops. And some people were given a placebo. A placebo is a fake medicine, like an eye drop with no drug in it. This helps researchers see if the real medicine is working. People were in these studies for different lengths of time, from one day to one year.

### **Results**

Here is what the researchers found after looking at all 17 studies.

**How Well the Medicines Worked**

*   The new ROKi eye drops did lower eye pressure. They worked better than the fake medicine.
*   However, two older, common medicines worked a little bit better at lowering eye pressure than the ROKi drugs did when used alone.
*   The best results for lowering eye pressure came from using two medicines together. When a ROKi drug was used with an older drug called latanoprost, it lowered eye pressure more than using either medicine by itself.

**Safety and Side Effects**

*   People who used the new ROKi drugs had more eye-related side effects. This was true when compared to both the older medicines and the fake medicine. Side effects included things like red or sore eyes.
*   It is important to know that these side effects were described as mild. They did not last for a long time. The side effects also went away if a person stopped using the medicine.
*   The researchers did not find that the ROKi drugs were linked to any serious or dangerous side effects.

**What the Researchers Concluded**

The new ROKi eye drops can help people with glaucoma by lowering eye pressure. They may not work quite as well as some older medicines when used on their own. But, they may be very helpful when used together with another glaucoma medicine.

ROKi drugs can cause more mild side effects in the eye, but they do not seem to cause any serious problems. The researchers believe that more studies are needed. Future studies should last longer to help us learn more about the long-term effects of these new medicines.","Rho kinase inhibitors for primary open‐angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension
Question 
What are the benefits and risks of rho kinase inhibitor eye drops to treat people with either glaucoma or increased eye pressure? 
Key messages 
Antiglaucomatous eye drops such as latanoprost and timolol may reduce the eye pressure more compared with treatment with a rho kinase inhibitor, but the difference with timolol is small. When combining rho kinase inhibitors with different types of medicine, the eye pressure may be reduced more. People treated with a rho kinase inhibitor experience more adverse events (side effects) compared with other treatments. Future research in this area should focus on reporting disease progression (how the glaucoma gets worse over time). 
What is glaucoma? 
Glaucoma is a sight‐threatening eye disease that can lead to blindness if left untreated. There are different types of glaucoma and the most common is called primary open‐angle glaucoma. High eye pressure is a known risk factor for developing glaucoma.  
Medical glaucoma treatment 
There are different types of eye drops that can be used to treat glaucoma. All medical treatments of glaucoma work by reducing eye pressure. Latanoprost and timolol are two glaucoma medications, and one of the new types of glaucoma medicine is called a rho kinase inhibitor.  
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to examine whether the effectiveness and safety of rho kinase inhibitor eye drops were better or worse than other medicines. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared:
‐ rho kinase inhibitor with placebo (a treatment with no therapeutic effect);
‐ rho kinase inhibitor with other types of glaucoma treatments (latanoprost and timolol).
Search date  
We searched medical databases on 11 December 2020.
What did we find? 
We found 17 studies examining 4953 people aged at least 18 years diagnosed with primary open‐angle glaucoma or high eye pressure and treated with a rho kinase inhibitor. The studies varied in treatment duration from 24 hours to 12 months. They were conducted in the USA, Canada and Japan. Of the studies, 16  were funded by pharmaceutical companies and one did not provide information about potential funding sources. The effect of treatment was evaluated by measuring the eye pressure and assessing the adverse events of treatment. 
The studies did not report data disease progression, but they reported data on the lowering of the pressure within the eye and adverse events. Treatment with latanoprost may be better than rho kinase inhibitor. Treatment with timolol may be slightly better than treatment with rho kinase inhibitor. Furthermore, treatment with both rho kinase inhibitor and latanoprost or timolol probably reduces the eye pressure even more. Overall, the studies reported adverse events very differently. More people treated with rho kinase inhibitors may have experienced eye‐related adverse events; however, we are not very certain about these findings. There were no serious adverse events reported for treatment with rho kinase inhibitor. 
Main limitations of the evidence 
The studies did not report all the outcomes that we were interested in. The studies focused on specific outcomes such as eye pressure and adverse events, whereas we wanted to answer other questions as well. The current evidence was based on few studies. Some studies were conducted in a way that may have introduced errors into the results. Studies varied in the way they measured the outcomes and thus may not be comparable to each other.

Shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) is a widely used method to treat renal and ureteral stone. It fragments stones into smaller pieces that are then able to pass spontaneously down the ureter and into the bladder. Alpha‐blockers may assist in promoting the passage of stone fragments, but their effectiveness remains uncertain.  
Objectives
To assess the effects of alpha‐blockers as adjuvant medical expulsive therapy plus usual care compared to placebo and usual care or usual care alone in adults undergoing shock wave lithotripsy for renal or ureteral stones. 
Search methods
We performed a comprehensive literature search of the Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase, several clinical trial registries and grey literature for published and unpublished studies irrespective of language. The date of the most recent search was 27 February 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials of adults undergoing SWL. Participants in the intervention group had to have received an alpha‐blocker as adjuvant medical expulsive therapy plus usual care. For the comparator group, we considered studies in which participants received placebo. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion/exclusion, and performed data abstraction and risk of bias assessment. We conducted meta‐analysis for the identified dichotomous and continuous outcomes using RevManWeb according to Cochrane methods using a random‐effects model. We judged the certainty of evidence on a per outcome basis using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 40 studies with 4793 participants randomized to usual care and an alpha‐blocker versus usual care alone. Only four studies were placebo controlled. The mean age of participants was 28.6 to 56.8 years and the mean stone size prior to SWL was 7.1 mm to 13.2 mm. The most widely used alpha‐blocker was tamsulosin; others were silodosin, doxazosin, terazosin and alfuzosin.  
Alpha‐blockers may improve clearance of stone fragments after SWL (risk ratio (RR) 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09 to 1.23; I² = 78%; studies = 36; participants = 4084; low certainty evidence). Based on the stone clearance rate of 69.3% observed in the control arm, an alpha‐blocker may increase stone clearance to 80.4%. This corresponds to 111 more (62 more to 159 more) participants per 1000 clearing their stone fragments. 
Alpha‐blockers may reduce the need for auxiliary treatments after SWL (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.00; I² = 16%; studies = 12; participants = 1251; low certainty evidence), but also includes the possibility of no effect. Based on a rate of auxiliary treatments in the usual care arm of 9.7%, alpha‐blockers may reduce the rate to 6.5%. This corresponds 32 fewer (53 fewer to 0 fewer) participants per 1000 undergoing auxiliary treatments. 
Alpha‐blockers may reduce major adverse events (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.80; I² = 0%; studies = 7; participants = 747; low certainty evidence). Major adverse events occurred in 25.8% of participants in the usual care group; alpha‐blockers would reduce this to 15.5%. This corresponds to 103 fewer (139 fewer to 52 fewer) major adverse events per 1000 with alpha‐blocker treatment. None of the reported major adverse events appeared drug‐related; most were emergency room visits or rehospitalizations. 
Alpha‐blockers may reduce stone clearance time in days (mean difference (MD) –3.74, 95% CI –5.25 to –2.23; I² = 86%; studies = 14; participants = 1790; low certainty evidence). We found no evidence for the outcome of quality of life. 
For those outcomes for which we were able to perform subgroup analyses, we found no evidence of interaction with stone location, stone size or type of alpha‐blocker. We were unable to conduct an analysis by lithotripter type. The results were also largely unchanged when the analyses were limited to placebo controlled studies and those in which participants explicitly only received a single SWL session. 
Authors' conclusions
Based on low certainty evidence, adjuvant alpha‐blocker therapy following SWL in addition to usual care may result in improved stone clearance, less need for auxiliary treatments, fewer major adverse events and a reduced stone clearance time compared to usual care alone. We did not find evidence for quality of life. The low certainty of evidence means that our confidence in the effect estimate is limited; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.

Do Certain Medicines Help Pass Kidney Stones After a Shock Wave Treatment?

### **Rationale**

Kidney stones are hard, pebble-like pieces that form in the kidneys. They can cause a lot of pain when they move through the body’s tubes for urine. One way to treat kidney stones is with a method called shock wave lithotripsy. This treatment uses sound waves from outside the body to break the stones into very small pieces.

After the treatment, these small pieces must pass out of your body when you urinate. This can still be difficult and painful. Researchers wanted to know if a certain type of medicine could help make this process easier and faster.

These medicines are called alpha-blockers. Alpha-blockers work by relaxing the muscles in the tubes that carry urine from the kidneys. The researchers thought that if these tubes are more relaxed, the stone pieces might pass through more easily. This study was needed to see if alpha-blockers really help people after they have the shock wave treatment.

### **Trial Design**

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked for all the good quality studies that had already been done on this topic. They combined the results from all these past studies to get a stronger answer. This is called a review.

The researchers looked at 40 different studies. In total, these studies included nearly 4,800 adults, both men and women. The people in the studies were between 29 and 57 years old on average. They all had kidney stones and were getting the shock wave treatment.

In each study, the patients were split into groups by chance. One group took an alpha-blocker medicine after their shock wave treatment. The other group did not take an alpha-blocker. Some people in the second group were given a placebo. A placebo is a sugar pill that has no medicine in it. This helps to compare the effects of the real medicine fairly.

### **Results**

**What were the main results of the study?**

The study found that alpha-blockers may help people after the shock wave treatment in several ways. However, the researchers said we cannot be very sure about these results. They said the evidence was of ""low certainty."" This means that future studies could find different results.

**Passing all the stone pieces**
More people who took an alpha-blocker were able to pass all their stone pieces.
*   For every 100 people who took an alpha-blocker, about 80 passed all their stones.
*   For every 100 people who did not take the medicine, about 69 passed all their stones.

**Needing more medical help**
People who took an alpha-blocker were less likely to need another treatment to get rid of the stones.
*   For every 100 people who took the medicine, about 7 needed more treatment.
*   For every 100 people who did not take the medicine, about 10 needed more treatment.

**Having serious problems**
People taking the medicine also seemed to have fewer serious problems. These problems were not side effects from the drug. They were things like having to go to the emergency room or being admitted to the hospital again.
*   For every 100 people who took the medicine, about 16 had a serious problem.
*   For every 100 people who did not take the medicine, about 26 had a serious problem.

**Time to pass stones**
People who took an alpha-blocker seemed to pass their stone pieces more quickly. On average, they passed their stones about 4 days faster than those who did not take the medicine.

**Conclusions from the researchers**
The researchers concluded that taking an alpha-blocker medicine after shock wave treatment may help. It may help you pass your stones completely, need less follow-up treatment, have fewer major problems, and pass the stones faster.

But, it is very important to know that the researchers are not sure about these benefits. More and better studies are needed to be certain if these medicines truly help everyone.","After using shock waves to break up kidney stones, do medicines called alpha‑blockers help to get rid of the stone fragments? 
What are kidney stones? 
Waste products in the blood can sometimes form crystals that collect inside the kidneys. These can build up over time to form a hard stone‐like lump, called a kidney stone. 
Kidney stones can develop in both kidneys especially in people with certain medical conditions or who are taking certain medicines, or if people do not drink enough water or fluids. Stones can cause severe pain, fever and a kidney infection if they block the ureter. 
Treatments for kidney stones 
Most stones are small enough to pass out in the urine: drinking plenty of water and other fluids will help. Larger kidney stones may be too big to pass out naturally and are usually removed by surgery. 
Shock wave lithotripsy is a non‐surgical way to treat stones in the kidney or ureter. High energy sound waves are applied to the outside of the body to break kidney stones into smaller pieces. After shock wave treatment, medicines called alpha‐blockers are sometimes given to help the stone fragments pass out naturally. 
Alpha‐blockers work by relaxing muscles and helping to keep blood vessels open. They are usually used to treat high blood pressure and problems with storing and passing urine in men who have an enlarged prostate gland. Alpha‐blockers may relax the muscle in the ureters, which might help to get rid of kidney stones and fragments.              
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out how well alpha‐blockers work to help kidney stone fragments pass out in the urine. We also wanted to find out about potential unwanted effects that might be associated with alpha‐blockers. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at giving alpha‐blockers to adults, after shock wave treatment, to clear kidney stone fragments. 
We looked for randomized controlled studies, in which the treatments that people received were decided at random, because these studies usually give the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. 
Search date: we included evidence published up to 27 February 2020. 
What we found 
We found 40 studies including 4793 people who had shock wave treatment to break up their kidney stones. Most of the studies were done in Asia; some were in Europe, Africa and South America. Most studies did not report their sources of funding. 
The studies compared giving an alpha‐blocker with giving a placebo (dummy) treatment or usual care (could include antibiotics, painkillers and fluids given by mouth or through a drip). 
Tamsulosin was the most commonly studied alpha‐blocker; the others were silodosin, doxazosin, terazosin and alfuzosin. 
What are the results of our review? 
Compared with usual care or a placebo treatment, alpha‐blockers may:
clear kidney stones in more people: in 111 more people for every 1000 people treated (36 studies); 
clear stones faster: by nearly four days (14 studies);
reduce the need for extra treatments to clear stones: in 32 fewer people for every 1000 people treated (12 studies); and 
cause fewer unwanted effects: affecting 103 fewer people for every 1000 people treated (seven studies). 
Most unwanted effects were emergency visits to hospitals, and people going back into hospital for stone related problems. Unwanted effects were more common in people who had usual care or a placebo treatment than in people given alpha‐blockers. 
None of the studies looked at people's quality of life (well‐being).
How reliable are these results? 
We are uncertain about these results because they were based on studies in which it was unclear how people were chosen to take part; it was unclear if results were reported fully; some results were inconsistent and in some studies the results varied widely.  Our results are likely to change if further evidence becomes available. 
Conclusions 
Giving an alpha‐blocker after shock wave treatment to break up kidney stones might clear the fragments faster, in more people and reduce the need for extra treatments. Alpha‑blockers might cause fewer unwanted effects than usual care or a placebo.

10.1002-14651858.CD002779.pub3,"Interventions for treating burning mouth syndrome
Review question 
Which treatments help to relieve symptoms for people with burning mouth syndrome (BMS)?
Background 
BMS is a common painful condition. Symptoms include burning, dryness or uncomfortable sensations in the mouth and changes to taste, with no obvious underlying medical or dental cause. BMS is usually persistent and suffered long term, and can lead to a reduced quality of life (QoL). Currently, scientific research suggests that BMS is caused by underlying damage to the nerves. There are many treatments available including drugs for anxiety, other psychological conditions and increasing saliva production, protective barriers and treatments applied to the mouth surface amongst others. 
Study characteristics 
This review of studies was carried out through Cochrane Oral Health, and the evidence is current up to 31 December 2015. 
We found 23 studies (assessing 1121 people; 83% were women), published between 1995 and 2015 to include in this review. Twenty‐one studies assessed short‐term (up to three months) symptom relief, and four studies assessed long‐term (from three to six months) symptom relief. Seventeen studies provided information about side effect occurrence, seven studies assessed a measure of QoL, and two studies assessed changes in taste and feeling of dryness. 
All of the 23 treatments included in this review were compared to a placebo (fake treatment): antidepressants and antipsychotics (two studies), antiseizure drugs (one study), types of tranquillisers (four studies), saliva stimulants (one study), dietary supplements (12 studies), directed energy waves (one study), physical barriers (one study), psychological therapies (one study), and treatments applied to the mouth surface (five studies). 
Key results 
Short‐term symptom relief  
We found evidence of short‐term symptom relief for directed energy waves (one study, 58 participants), a type of tranquilliser used topically (that is held in the mouth before being removed, and which also acts as an antiseizure drug) called clonazepam (two studies, 111 participants), thin plastic tongue covers (one study, 50 participants), and an antiseizure drug called gabapentin (one study, 100 participants). 
There was no difference in short‐term symptom relief found for antidepressants, saliva stimulants, and another type of tranquilliser used systemically (one that is swallowed) also called clonazepam. We were unable to show whether dietary supplements or treatments applied to the mouth surface provide symptom relief in the short term or not. 
Short‐term relief was not reported for the single study that assessed a psychological therapy. 
Long‐term symptom relief  
We found evidence of long‐term symptom relief for psychological therapy (one study, 30 participants), chili pepper mouthrinse (one study, 18 participants) and the topical tranquilliser called clonazepam (one study, 66 participants). 
We found there was no difference in long‐term symptom relief for dietary supplements or treatments applied to the mouth surface. 
Studies which assessed antidepressants, directed energy waves, saliva stimulants, antiseizure drugs, or physical barriers did not evaluate long‐term symptom relief. 
Change in QoL  
There was evidence of short‐term improvement in QoL for directed energy waves (one study, 58 patients), although no difference was found for antidepressants, tranquillisers, dietary supplements and physical barriers. No study assessed long‐term QoL changes. 
Change in taste or feeling of dryness  
A few studies assessed short‐term change in taste or feeling of dryness (none evaluated these outcomes long‐term), but there was not enough evidence to judge the effects of treatment on these outcomes. 
Side effects  
Side effects were more likely to be experienced with antidepressants (dizziness and drowsiness more likely: one study, 37 people), and with a dietary supplement called alpha lipoic acid (also known as ALA) with or without other ingredients (headaches more likely: two studies, 118 people; and upset stomachs more likely: three studies, 138 people). 
Quality of the evidence  Overall, we found very low‐quality evidence for each short‐ and long‐term outcome we investigated (symptom relief; changes in QoL, taste and feeling of dryness; and side effects) in all types of assessed treatment: antidepressants and antipsychotics, antiseizure drugs, types of tranquillisers, saliva stimulants, dietary supplements, directed energy waves, physical barriers (except side effects, which was assessed as low quality), psychological therapies, and treatments applied to the mouth surface. As we found so few studies at low risk of bias, we are currently unable to prove or disprove the effectiveness of any treatments for managing BMS.

Which Treatments Help People with Burning Mouth Syndrome?

**Rationale**
Burning mouth syndrome is a health problem that causes pain in the mouth. People with this problem feel a burning or hot feeling. It can also cause a dry mouth or change how things taste. Doctors often cannot find a clear reason for this pain.

This problem can last for a long time. It can make it hard to enjoy daily life. Researchers think that burning mouth syndrome may be caused by damage to the nerves in the mouth.

There are many treatments that doctors try. But it is not clear which ones work the best. This study was done to look at past research. The goal was to find out which treatments really help people feel better.

**Trial Design**
This was not a new study with new patients. Instead, researchers looked at all the studies that were already done on this topic. They wanted to combine all the results to get a clearer answer.

The researchers found 23 studies to look at. These studies included over 1,100 people with burning mouth syndrome. Most of the people in the studies were women. About 8 out of every 10 people were women.

In most of the studies, one group of people got a real treatment. Another group got a placebo. A placebo is a fake treatment, like a sugar pill. This helps researchers see if the real treatment works better than taking nothing at all. The studies looked at many types of treatments. These included pills, talk therapy, and treatments put right in the mouth.

**Results**
The researchers looked at how well the treatments worked for a short time (up to 3 months) and for a long time (up to 6 months).

**What worked for a short time?**
Some treatments seemed to help people feel better for a few months. These were:
*   A treatment using special energy waves.
*   A type of calming medicine that you hold in your mouth and then spit out.
*   A drug for seizures called gabapentin.
*   Thin plastic covers worn on the tongue.

Some other treatments did not seem to help in the short term. The researchers could not tell if supplements or treatments put on the mouth surface worked.

**What worked for a long time?**
A few treatments seemed to help people feel better for up to 6 months. These were:
*   Talk therapy to help with thoughts and feelings.
*   A mouth rinse made with chili pepper.
*   The calming medicine that you hold in your mouth.

**Other results**
*   **Side Effects:** Some treatments had side effects. Pills for depression could make people feel dizzy or sleepy. A supplement called alpha lipoic acid (ALA) sometimes caused headaches or upset stomachs.
*   **Quality of Life:** The special energy wave treatment was the only one that seemed to help people feel better about their lives in the short term.
*   **Taste and Dryness:** There was not enough information to know if any treatments helped with taste or dry mouth.

**Main Conclusion from the Researchers**
The researchers found that the proof from all the studies was not very strong. This is because many of the studies were small. Or they were not designed in the best way to give clear answers.

Because the proof was weak, we still cannot be sure which treatments are best for burning mouth syndrome. More and better studies are needed. This will help doctors and patients make the best choices for care in the future.","Interventions for treating burning mouth syndrome

10.1002-14651858.CD015270,"Background
Vaccines are effective in preventing severe COVID‐19, a disease for which few treatments are available and which can lead to disability or death. Widespread vaccination against COVID‐19 may help protect those not yet able to get vaccinated. In addition, new and vaccine‐resistant mutations of SARS‐CoV‐2 may be less likely to develop if the spread of COVID‐19 is limited. Different vaccines are now widely available in many settings. However, vaccine hesitancy is a serious threat to the goal of nationwide vaccination in many countries and poses a substantial threat to population health. This scoping review maps interventions aimed at increasing COVID‐19 vaccine uptake and decreasing COVID‐19 vaccine hesitancy.  
Objectives
To scope the existing research landscape on interventions to enhance the willingness of different populations to be vaccinated against COVID‐19, increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake, or decrease COVID‐19 vaccine hesitancy, and to map the evidence according to addressed populations and intervention categories.   
Search methods
We searched Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded and Emerging Sources Citation Index), WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, PsycINFO, and CINAHL to 11 October 2021.  
Selection criteria
We included studies that assess the impact of interventions implemented to enhance the willingness of different populations to be vaccinated against COVID‐19, increase vaccine uptake, or decrease COVID‐19 vaccine hesitancy. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non‐randomised studies of intervention (NRSIs), observational studies and case studies with more than 100 participants. Furthermore, we included systematic reviews and meta‐analyses. We did not limit the scope of the review to a specific population or to specific outcomes assessed. We excluded interventions addressing hesitancy towards vaccines for diseases other than COVID‐19. 
Data collection and analysis
Data were analysed according to a protocol uploaded to the Open Science Framework. We used an interactive scoping map to visualise the results of our scoping review. We mapped the identified interventions according to pre‐specified intervention categories, that were adapted to better fit the evidence. The intervention categories were: communication interventions, policy interventions, educational interventions, incentives (both financial and non‐financial), interventions to improve access, and multidimensional interventions. The study outcomes were also included in the mapping. Furthermore, we mapped the country in which the study was conducted, the addressed population, and whether the design was randomised‐controlled or not.  
Main results
We included 96 studies in the scoping review, 35 of which are ongoing and 61 studies with published results. We did not identify any relevant systematic reviews. For an overview, please see the interactive scoping map (https://tinyurl.com/2p9jmx24).   
Studies with published results 
Of the 61 studies with published results, 46 studies were RCTs and 15 NRSIs. The interventions investigated in the studies were heterogeneous with most studies testing communication strategies to enhance COVID‐19 vaccine uptake. Most studies assessed the willingness to get vaccinated as an outcome. The majority of studies were conducted in English‐speaking high‐income countries. Moreover, most studies investigated digital interventions in an online setting. Populations that were addressed were diverse. For example, studies targeted healthcare workers, ethnic minorities in the USA, students, soldiers, at‐risk patients, or the general population.  
Ongoing studies 
Of the 35 ongoing studies, 29 studies are RCTs and six NRSIs. Educational and communication interventions were the most used types of interventions. The majority of ongoing studies plan to assess vaccine uptake as an outcome. Again, the majority of studies are being conducted in English‐speaking high‐income countries. In contrast to the studies with published results, most ongoing studies will not be conducted online. Addressed populations range from minority populations in the USA to healthcare workers or students. Eleven ongoing studies have estimated completion dates in 2022.   
Authors' conclusions
We were able to identify and map a variety of heterogeneous interventions for increasing COVID‐19 vaccine uptake or decreasing vaccine hesitancy. Our results demonstrate that this is an active field of research with 61 published studies and 35 studies still ongoing. This review gives a comprehensive overview of interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake and can be the foundation for subsequent systematic reviews on the effectiveness of interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake.  
A research gap was shown for studies conducted in low and middle‐income countries and studies investigating policy interventions and improved access, as well as for interventions addressing children and adolescents. As COVID‐19 vaccines become more widely available, these populations and interventions should not be neglected in research.

Looking at Studies to Understand How to Encourage COVID-19 Vaccination

**Rationale**

COVID-19 is a disease that can make people very sick. It can cause long-term health problems or even death. Vaccines are a very good tool to prevent people from getting seriously ill from COVID-19.

When many people get vaccinated, it helps protect the whole community. This includes people who cannot get the vaccine, like very young babies or some people with weak immune systems. If the virus cannot spread easily, it is also less likely to change into new, more dangerous forms.

However, some people are not sure if they want to get a COVID-19 vaccine. When people are unsure about vaccines, it can make it hard to protect everyone from the disease.

Researchers wanted to understand what is being done to help people feel more confident about getting the vaccine. They decided to do a big review of all the research on this topic. The main goal was to gather and map out all the different studies that have tried to encourage people to get the COVID-19 vaccine.

**Trial Design**

This was not a study where people were given a new medicine or treatment. Instead, it was a review of other studies that have already been done. This is called a scoping review. Its purpose is to get a big-picture view of all the research in a certain area.

The research team searched large medical databases for studies about COVID-19 vaccination. They included studies that were published up to October 2021.

They looked for any study that tested an action, or intervention, to help people decide to get a COVID-19 vaccine. The studies they included looked at many different groups of people. These groups included healthcare workers, students, soldiers, and the general public. There was no time limit for how long the studies had to be.

The researchers sorted all the studies they found into different groups. They grouped them based on the type of action that was tested. These actions included:
*   New ways to talk to people about vaccines.
*   New rules or policies.
*   Teaching people about vaccines.
*   Giving people small rewards for getting a shot.
*   Making it easier for people to get to a vaccine clinic.

**Results**

The researchers found a total of 96 studies about encouraging COVID-19 vaccination. Of these, 61 studies were finished and had results. The other 35 studies were still going on.

Most of the 61 finished studies tested different ways to communicate with people about vaccines. For example, they tested messages from doctors or community leaders. Most of these studies took place online. They were mainly done in rich, English-speaking countries. The studies usually measured if an action made people say they were more willing to get a vaccine.

The 35 studies that were still going on were also looking at communication and education. However, more of these new studies are being done in person instead of online. Like the finished studies, they are also mostly taking place in rich, English-speaking countries.

This review gives a complete map of the research on this important topic. It shows that many scientists are working to find the best ways to help people feel good about their choice to get vaccinated. This map can help other researchers see what has already been studied and what questions still need to be answered.

The authors of the review concluded that more research is needed. Specifically, they saw a need for more studies in countries with less money. They also noted that we need to learn more about other types of actions, like making vaccines easier to get. Finally, they said it is very important to do more research that includes children and teenagers.","Interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake 
Background 
Vaccines are effective in preventing death or severe illness from COVID‐19, a disease for which few treatments are available. Widespread vaccination against COVID‐19 may help protect those not yet able to get vaccinated. However, many people do not want to get vaccinated against COVID‐19. This can put them at increased risk of severe disease and death. 
What was our aim? 
We wanted to find out which interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake have been or are currently evaluated.  
Methods 
We searched medical databases and trial registries until the 11 of October 2021. We included all studies investigating interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake. We excluded studies looking at other vaccines, for example, measles. We included all forms of studies as long as they had more than 100 participants.  
Once we found the studies, we categorised the interventions into the following groups: communication interventions, policy interventions, interventions to improve access, educational interventions, incentives, and multidimensional interventions. We summarised the results in an interactive scoping map. Furthermore, we mapped the study outcomes, the country in which the study was conducted, the study population, and the study design. 
Results 
We included 96 studies in evidence mapping, 35 of which are ongoing and 61 studies with published results. The interventions tested in these studies are very diverse. Many studies used communication strategies to convince people to get vaccinated against COVID‐19.  Interventions that included information on vaccination or a mixture of different strategies were also often used.  
A majority of studies were conducted in English‐speaking countries of the global north, for example, the USA. Moreover, most studies investigated digital interventions in an online setting. The populations addressed varied across the studies. For example, studies addressed healthcare workers, ethnic minorities in the USA, students, soldiers, villagers, at‐risk patients, or the general population.

Conclusion 
We identified a large number of studies that investigate how COVID‐19 vaccine uptake might be increased. However, more studies are needed focusing on lower‐middle‐income countries and on children. Future research should compare the effectiveness of different interventions to improve COVID‐19 vaccine uptake.
