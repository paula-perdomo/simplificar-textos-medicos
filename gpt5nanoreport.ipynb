            "Can exercise replace chest therapy for cystic fibrosis?\n",
            "\n",
            "Rationale\n",
            "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lung disease that makes thick mucus build up in the airways. This mucus can irritate and injure the airways and raise the risk of infections. To help clear mucus, people with CF often use chest physiotherapy, a group of simple techniques that loosen and move mucus out of the lungs. These methods are also called airway clearance therapy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some people think exercise might help move mucus too. During exercise, breathing changes can push air through the lungs in different ways, which could help push mucus out. The idea is to see if exercise could work as well as other airway clearance methods or even replace them. If exercise can work, it might lessen the daily burden of treatment for people with CF. This review looked at what studies up to a certain date found about exercise versus other airway clearance methods.\n",
            "\n",
            "Trial Design\n",
            "This is a review of four smaller studies. The total number of people in these studies was 86. Participants were aged 7 to 41 years and had varying levels of CF illness. Some were well, and one study included people in the hospital with a chest infection.\n",
            "\n",
            "The review compared exercise alone or exercise used with another airway clearance method to other clearance methods. The methods tested were:\n",
            "- Postural drainage and percussion (PD&P): a chest therapy that uses body positions and taps to loosen mucus.\n",
            "- Active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT): a guided breathing method to help clear mucus.\n",
            "- Underwater bubble positive end expiratory pressure (uPEP or bubble PEP): a device that helps push air to loosen mucus.\n",
            "\n",
            "The length of the studies ranged from four days to six months. The people in the studies were in different health states, so the results apply to a mix of situations.\n",
            "\n",
            "Results\n",
            "Overall, the researchers did not find enough proof to say exercise can replace other airway clearance methods. Here are the main findings, stated simply:\n",
            "\n",
            "- Lung function and mucus clearance: In the four studies, exercise did not clearly beat or fall short of other methods for improving lung function or moving mucus out of the lungs. In one study, people who did exercise alone cleared less mucus than those who did ACBT.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Exercise ability and preference: In at least one study, people who did exercise got better at exercising, and some people liked exercise more than the other methods.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Safety: No bad effects or safety problems were shown with exercise in any study.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Quality of life and antibiotics: None of the studies gave clear results about people’s quality of life or whether they needed extra antibiotics.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Exercise plus PD&P vs PD&P alone: Two studies looked at this. In one study, PD&P alone seemed to boost lung function more at two weeks. In another, after six months, the combination of exercise plus PD&P seemed to help more, but the full data were not given. No clear difference in how long people could exercise, the amount of mucus cleared, or how often people stayed in the hospital. One study suggested fewer hospital stays with exercise plus PD&P.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Exercise versus uPEP: One study compared exercise to uPEP. No safety problems were seen. People felt exercise was more tiring but also more enjoyable. There was no difference in the total amount of mucus cleared, and other outcomes (lung function, life quality, hospital stays) were not reported.\n",
            "\n",
            "What this means for patients\n",
            "- At this time, we cannot say that exercise can replace other airway clearance methods for CF.\n",
            "- Exercise may be a good option for some people, and it might be preferred by some. But more evidence is needed to know which people it helps most and when.\n",
            "- Exercise appears safe in the studies looked at.\n",
            "- We did not get enough data to tell if exercise changes daily life, how many people need extra antibiotics, or how it affects hospital stays.\n",
            "\n",
            "Bottom line\n",
            "Right now, exercise is not proven to fully replace chest therapy for CF. More well-designed, larger studies are needed to learn if exercise can be a safe and effective part of mucus clearance for people with CF, and in which situations it works best. If you are thinking about using exercise as part of CF treatment, talk with your doctor or CF care team to tailor a plan to your needs.\n"

There is uncertainty about the safety of these drugs and their potential risk of causing cancer. Moreover, it has already been shown that infertility itself increases the risk of ovarian cancer. \\nThe aim of the review We aimed with this updated systematic review to summarise current published research on the risk of ovarian cancer in subfertile women treated with fertility drugs compared to the general population and to subfertile women not treated with fertility drugs. \\nWhat are the main findings? Overall, based on 37 studies, which included a total of 4,684,724 women, we did not find enough strong evidence suggesting a potentially higher risk of ovarian cancer in women treated with fertility drugs. \\nA cumulative analysis of 12 case\\u2010control studies from the USA revealed increased risk of ovarian cancer in women using fertility drugs, and this risk was higher in nulliparous women (women who have not given birth) when compared to multiparous women (women who have given birth to more than one child). One of the 37 included studies reported a two\\u2010fold increase in development of serous borderline ovarian tumour in women after more than four cycles of progesterone; however the number of cases included in this group was very small. One cohort study also suggested an increased risk of borderline ovarian tumour in infertile women treated with clomiphene citrate when compared to infertile women who did not undergo treatment to conceive. \\nQuality of the evidence Studies showing an increase in the risk of ovarian cancer were of low methodological quality, with short follow\\u2010up periods and with lack of adjustment for important confounding factors; therefore the results are too unreliable. However, compared with older studies, recent studies have tended to report both the dose and the number of cycles of infertility drugs and have included more contemporary drug regimens; this has made the final results more reliable. \\nWhat are the conclusions? Infertility has been found to be an important risk factor for ovarian cancer. However, the association between infertility drugs and ovarian cancer needs to be addressed with consideration of other factors such as age, body mass index, parity, genetic factors (i.e. family history for ovarian cancer), and aetiology of the infertility, along with longer follow\\u2010up times. \\n\",\n          \"Anticoagulant treatment for subsegmental pulmonary embolism\\nBackground \\nAcute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cause of death, accounting for 50,000 to 200,000 deaths annually. It is the third most common cause of mortality among the cardiovascular diseases, after coronary artery disease and stroke. The advent of multi\\u2010detector computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has allowed better assessment of PE regarding visualisation of the peripheral pulmonary arteries, increasing its rate of diagnosis. More cases of peripheral PEs, such as isolated subsegmental PE (SSPE) and incidental PE, have thereby been identified. These two conditions are usually found in patients with few or no classic symptoms such as coughing (including coughing up blood), chest or upper back pain, acute shortness of breath, or general or specific failure of the circulation that is either cardiac or peripheral in nature. However, in patients with an impaired cardiac and pulmonary condition the classic PE symptoms can be found with isolated SSPEs. Incidental SSPE is found casually in asymptomatic patients, usually by diagnostic imaging performed for other reasons (for example routine computed tomography (CT) for cancer staging in oncologic patients). Patients with isolated SSPE or incidental PE may have a more benign clinical presentation compared to those with proximal PEs. However, the clinical significance and prognosis in these patients has to be studied to evaluate whether anticoagulation therapy is required. \\nReview question \\nWhat is the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulation therapy versus control in patients with subsegmental pulmonary embolism (SSPE) or incidental SSPE? \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe did not identify any studies that met the inclusion criteria.\\nKey results \\nThere is no evidence from randomised controlled trials (current to 26 November 2019) on the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulation therapy versus control in patients with isolated subsegmental pulmonary embolism (SSPE) or incidental SSPE. We cannot draw any conclusions. Well\\u2010conducted research is required before informed practice decisions can be made. \\nQuality of evidence \\nIt is not possible to review methodological quality in the absence of studies eligible for inclusion in the review. \\n\",\n          \"How accurate are rapid antigen tests for diagnosing COVID\\u201019?\\nKey messages \\n\\u2022 Rapid antigen tests are most accurate when they are used in people who have signs or symptoms of COVID\\u201019, especially during the first week of illness. People who test negative may still be infected. \\n\\u2022 Rapid antigen tests are considerably less accurate when they are used in people with no signs or symptoms of infection, but do perform better in people who have been in contact with someone who has confirmed COVID\\u201019. \\n\\u2022 The accuracy of rapid antigen tests varies between tests that are produced by different manufacturers and there is a lack of evidence for many commercially available tests. \\nWhat are rapid point\\u2010of\\u2010care antigen tests for COVID\\u201019? \\nRapid point\\u2010of\\u2010care tests aim to confirm or rule out COVID\\u201019 infection in people with or without COVID\\u201019 symptoms. They: \\n\\u2022 are portable, so they can be used wherever the patient is (at the point\\u2010of\\u2010care) or in non\\u2010healthcare settings such as in the home; \\n\\u2022 are easy to perform, with a minimum amount of extra equipment or complicated preparation steps; \\n\\u2022 are less expensive than standard laboratory tests;\\n\\u2022 do not require a specialist operator or setting; and\\n\\u2022 provide results \\u2018while you wait\\u2019.\\nFor this review we were interested in rapid antigen tests, sometimes referred to as \\u2018lateral flow tests\\u2019. These tests identify proteins on the virus in samples taken from the nose or throat. They come in disposable plastic cassettes, similar to over\\u2010the\\u2010counter pregnancy tests. \\nWhy is this question important? \\nPeople with suspected COVID\\u201019 need to know quickly whether they are infected, so that they can self\\u2010isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. Currently, COVID\\u201019 infection is confirmed by a laboratory test called RT\\u2010PCR, which uses specialist equipment and often takes at least 24 hours to produce a result. \\nIn many places, rapid antigen tests have opened access to testing for many more people, with and without symptoms, and in locations other than healthcare settings. Faster diagnosis of COVID\\u201019 infection could allow people to take appropriate action more quickly, with the potential to reduce the spread of COVID\\u201019, but it is important to understand how accurate they are and the best way to use them. \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nWe wanted to know whether commercially available, rapid point\\u2010of\\u2010care antigen tests are accurate enough to diagnose COVID\\u201019 infection reliably, and to find out if accuracy differs in people with and without symptoms. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe looked for studies that measured the accuracy of any commercially produced rapid antigen test in people who were also tested for COVID\\u201019 using RT\\u2010PCR. People could be tested in hospital, in the community or in their own homes. Studies could test people with or without symptoms. \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe included 155 studies in the review. The main results are based on 152 studies investigating a total of 100,462 nose or throat samples; COVID\\u201019 was confirmed in 16,822 of these samples. Studies investigated 49 different antigen tests. Around 60% of studies took place in Europe. \\nMain results \\nIn people with confirmed COVID\\u201019, antigen tests correctly identified COVID\\u201019 infection in an average of 73% of people with symptoms, compared to 55% of people without symptoms. Tests were most accurate when used in the first week after symptoms began (an average of 82% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). This is likely to be because people have the most virus in their system in the first days after they are infected. For people with no symptoms, tests were most accurate in people likely to have been in contact with a case of COVID\\u201019 infection (an average of 64% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). \\nIn people who did not have COVID\\u201019, antigen tests correctly ruled out infection in 99.6% of people with symptoms and 99.7% of people without symptoms. \\nDifferent brands of tests varied in accuracy. Summary results (combined from more than one study per test brand) for seven tests met World Health Organization (WHO) standards as \\u2018acceptable\\u2019 for confirming and ruling out COVID\\u201019 in people with signs and symptoms of COVID\\u201019. Two more tests met the WHO acceptable standard in one study each. No test met this standard when evaluated in people without symptoms. \\nUsing summary results for symptomatic people tested during the first week after symptoms began, if 1000 people with symptoms had the antigen test, and 50 (5%) of them really had COVID\\u201019: \\n\\u2022 45 people would test positive for COVID\\u201019. Of these, 5 people (11%) would not have COVID\\u201019 (false positive result). \\n\\u2022 955 people would test negative for COVID\\u201019. Of these, 10 people (1.0%) would actually have COVID\\u201019 (false negative result). \\nIn people with no symptoms of COVID\\u201019 the number of confirmed cases is expected to be much lower than in people with symptoms. Using summary results for people with no known exposure to COVID\\u201019 in a bigger population of 10,000 people with no symptoms, where 50 (0.5%) of them really had COVID\\u201019: \\n\\u2022 62 people would test positive for COVID\\u201019. Of these, 30 people (48%) would not have COVID\\u201019 (false positive result). \\n\\u2022 9938 people would test negative for COVID\\u201019. Of these, 18 people (0.2%) would actually have COVID\\u201019 (false negative result). \\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \\nIn general, studies used relatively rigorous methods, particularly for selecting participants and performing the tests. Sometimes studies did not perform the test on the people for whom it was intended and did not follow the manufacturers\\u2019 instructions for using the test. Sometimes the tests were not carried out at the point of care. Studies used less rigorous methods for confirming the presence or absence of COVID\\u201019 infection; 91% of studies relied on a single negative RT\\u2010PCR result as evidence of no COVID\\u201019 infection. Results from different test brands varied, and relatively few studies directly compared one test brand with another. Finally, not all studies gave enough information about their participants for us to judge how long they had had symptoms, or even whether or not they had symptoms. \\nWhat does this mean? \\nIn people with symptoms, some rapid antigen tests are accurate enough to replace RT\\u2010PCR, especially for ruling in the presence of infection. Alternatively, where RT\\u2010PCR is available, rapid antigen tests could be used to select which people with symptoms require further testing with RT\\u2010PCR, thereby reducing the burden on laboratory services. This would be most useful when quick decisions are needed about patient care, to identify outbreaks, to allow people to self\\u2010isolate more quickly, or to initiate contact tracing. Rapid antigen tests are less good at ruling out infection in symptomatic people \\u2010 individuals who receive a negative rapid antigen test result may still be infected. \\nRapid antigen tests are less accurate when used in people with no symptoms of COVID\\u201019. More evidence is needed to understand the accuracy of rapid testing in people without symptoms and the extent to which repeated testing strategies can lead to reduced transmission, either for tests carried out at home or in non\\u2010healthcare settings such as schools. There is no independent evidence to support the use of many test brands. More direct comparisons of test brands are needed, with testers following manufacturers\\u2019 instructions. \\nHow up\\u2010to\\u2010date is this review? \\nThis review updates our previous review and includes evidence published up to 8 March 2021. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"simplified_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Plain Title\\nDo fertility drugs raise the risk of ovarian cancer?\\n\\nRationale\\n- Some drugs help women ovulate to treat trouble getting pregnant.  \\n- People worry these drugs could raise cancer risk.  \\n- Infertility itself can raise the risk of ovarian cancer.  \\n- This review looks at many studies to see if drugs add risk.\\n\\nTrial Design\\n- This is a systematic review of published studies.  \\n- It looks at women treated for infertility with fertility drugs, and compares them to others.  \\n- The total number of women studied is about 4.7 million in 37 studies.  \\n- Follow-up times varied. Newer studies have longer follow-up and more detail on dose and cycles.\\n\\nResults\\n- Overall, 37 studies with about 4.7 million women did not show strong ovarian cancer risk.  \\n- In 12 US case studies, risk rose, especially in women who had no children.  \\n- One study found more serous borderline tumors after cycles of progesterone, but cases were few.  \\n- Some studies link clomiphene to more borderline tumors in infertile women.  \\n- Infertility itself is a risk factor for ovarian cancer. Results must be read with care because many studies were small or flawed.\",\n          \"Plain Title\\nAre blood thinners good for small blood clots in the lungs?\\n\\nRationale\\nA pulmonary embolism (PE) is a dangerous blood clot in the lungs. It can block blood flow and is a major cause of death. Modern scans find more and more small clots in the outer parts of the lungs. Some clots are found by chance when a scan is done for another reason; this is called incidental SSPE. These small or incidental clots can cause few symptoms, but it is not clear what the best treatment is.\\n\\nDoctors use blood thinners, also called anticoagulants, to prevent more clots. But for small or incidentally found clots, we need to know if this treatment helps and if it is safe. The idea is that thinning the blood might stop more clots and help symptoms, but it could also raise the risk of bleeding. This study looked for solid evidence from good trials to answer these questions. The question was: do blood thinners work well and are they safe for people with SSPE or incidental SSPE?\\n\\nTrial Design\\nThis work is a review of past studies. The researchers searched for randomized trials. In a randomized trial, people are placed into two groups by chance. One group would get the blood thinner, the other would not, or would get a different treatment. The goal was to learn about safety and whether symptoms improve.\\n\\nThe study looked for adults with SSPE or incidental SSPE. It did not restrict by sex. The plan was to report what happened to people in the trials, and how long they stayed in the study. However, in this review, no eligible trials were found. Because of this, there were no people to follow and no study time to report. The search covered research available up to November 26, 2019.\\n\\nResults\\nThe main finding is simple: there are no randomized trials that test whether blood thinners help people with isolated SSPE or incidental SSPE. Because no trials met the criteria, we cannot say if the medicine helps or if it is safe in this situation.\\n\\nThis means there is no solid evidence to guide doctors or patients. Without good trials, we cannot make strong conclusions or recommendations. More careful, high\\u2011quality research is needed. If new studies are done, they should clearly compare blood thinners with not using them and report safe use and any benefits. Only then can doctors decide the best care for people with these small or incidental lung clots.\",\n          \"Plain Title\\nAre fast COVID tests good at finding infection?\\n\\nRationale\\nCOVID-19 is a lung illness that can spread easily. It can make people sick and keep them from work or school. Quick tests are useful because they can give results right away and help people isolate sooner. These tests are called rapid antigen tests. They look for a protein from the virus in a swab taken from the nose or throat. They are cheaper and easier to use than lab tests, and you can do them outside of a hospital.\\n\\nResearchers wanted to know how well these quick tests work. Do they correctly tell who is infected? Does the test work better for people with symptoms than for those with no symptoms? The hope is to guide using these tests in clinics, at home, or other places so people can act fast and stop the virus from spreading.\\n\\nTrial Design\\nThis work is a careful review of many studies, not one single trial. The researchers looked at studies that tested people with rapid antigen tests and also used a laboratory test called RT-PCR to confirm if someone really had the virus. They included tests done in hospitals, in the community, and at home. They looked at people with symptoms and people without symptoms.\\n\\nThe review covered a lot of ground. It included many different tests from many makers. It also included people of different ages and both sexes. In most studies, people only took one test and waited a short time for the result, since these tests give answers while you wait. The evidence in the review was collected up to early March 2021.\\n\\nResults\\nWhat did the researchers find about accuracy?\\n\\n- For people who truly have COVID-19 and show symptoms, the rapid test found the infection in about 7 out of 10 people. It missed the infection in about 3 out of 10 people with symptoms.\\n\\n- For people who have COVID-19 but have no symptoms, the test picked up the infection in about 5 out of 10 people. It missed about half of the infections.\\n\\n- The first week after symptoms begin is the best time to use the test. In that period, the test found infection in about 8 out of 10 people with symptoms.\\n\\n- For people who do not have symptoms but were around someone with COVID-19, the test found about 6 out of 10 infections.\\n\\n- When the person does not have COVID-19, the test correctly says \\u201cnot infected\\u201d most of the time. About 996 to 997 out of 1,000 people who do not have the virus test negative.\\n\\n- Results varied by which brand of test was used. Some tests met the World Health Organization\\u2019s acceptable standards for people with symptoms. A few tests met the standard in one study each. No test met the standard for people without symptoms.\\n\\n- In a large group of 10,000 people with no symptoms and no known exposure, about 50 people really had COVID. Of those 50, about 62 would test positive, but about 30 of those positives would be false positives. Among the 9,938 people who did not have COVID, about 18 would be false negatives.\\n\\nWhat this means for patients and care\\n- In people with symptoms, some rapid tests can be used to help confirm infection and decide if more tests are needed. They may help speed up care, stop spread, and guide actions like self\\u2011isolation and starting treatment.\\n- A negative rapid test in someone with symptoms does not completely rule out infection. A person can still have COVID-19 and may need a follow\\u2011up test, especially if symptoms remain.\\n- In people who have no symptoms, these tests are less reliable. They miss more infections and can give more false alarms. More evidence is needed to know how best to use them in schools, homes, or other non\\u2011healthcare settings.\\n- Results can vary by test brand, and not all brands have enough evidence to show how well they work. It is helpful to follow local guidelines and consider confirmatory lab testing when needed.\\n\\nConclusions from the researchers\\nRapid antigen tests can be helpful for people with symptoms to find infection quickly and may reduce the burden on lab testing. They work best in the first days after symptoms start. They are less accurate for people without symptoms. More studies are needed to compare different test brands directly and to see how repeated testing might improve accuracy, especially in people without symptoms.\\n\\nNotes for readers\\n- RT-PCR is a lab test that looks for the virus\\u2019s genetic material and is usually more accurate, but it takes longer.\\n- A rapid antigen test gives results in minutes, but its accuracy depends on symptoms, timing, and the brand of test used.\\n- Always follow health guidelines and talk with a health care provider if you have exposure or symptoms and get a test result that does not match how you feel.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

There is uncertainty about the safety of these drugs and their potential risk of causing cancer. Moreover, it has already been shown that infertility itself increases the risk of ovarian cancer. \\nThe aim of the review We aimed with this updated systematic review to summarise current published research on the risk of ovarian cancer in subfertile women treated with fertility drugs compared to the general population and to subfertile women not treated with fertility drugs. \\nWhat are the main findings? Overall, based on 37 studies, which included a total of 4,684,724 women, we did not find enough strong evidence suggesting a potentially higher risk of ovarian cancer in women treated with fertility drugs. \\nA cumulative analysis of 12 case\\u2010control studies from the USA revealed increased risk of ovarian cancer in women using fertility drugs, and this risk was higher in nulliparous women (women who have not given birth) when compared to multiparous women (women who have given birth to more than one child). One of the 37 included studies reported a two\\u2010fold increase in development of serous borderline ovarian tumour in women after more than four cycles of progesterone; however the number of cases included in this group was very small. One cohort study also suggested an increased risk of borderline ovarian tumour in infertile women treated with clomiphene citrate when compared to infertile women who did not undergo treatment to conceive. \\nQuality of the evidence Studies showing an increase in the risk of ovarian cancer were of low methodological quality, with short follow\\u2010up periods and with lack of adjustment for important confounding factors; therefore the results are too unreliable. However, compared with older studies, recent studies have tended to report both the dose and the number of cycles of infertility drugs and have included more contemporary drug regimens; this has made the final results more reliable. \\nWhat are the conclusions? Infertility has been found to be an important risk factor for ovarian cancer. However, the association between infertility drugs and ovarian cancer needs to be addressed with consideration of other factors such as age, body mass index, parity, genetic factors (i.e. family history for ovarian cancer), and aetiology of the infertility, along with longer follow\\u2010up times. \\n\",\n          \"Anticoagulant treatment for subsegmental pulmonary embolism\\nBackground \\nAcute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cause of death, accounting for 50,000 to 200,000 deaths annually. It is the third most common cause of mortality among the cardiovascular diseases, after coronary artery disease and stroke. The advent of multi\\u2010detector computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has allowed better assessment of PE regarding visualisation of the peripheral pulmonary arteries, increasing its rate of diagnosis. More cases of peripheral PEs, such as isolated subsegmental PE (SSPE) and incidental PE, have thereby been identified. These two conditions are usually found in patients with few or no classic symptoms such as coughing (including coughing up blood), chest or upper back pain, acute shortness of breath, or general or specific failure of the circulation that is either cardiac or peripheral in nature. However, in patients with an impaired cardiac and pulmonary condition the classic PE symptoms can be found with isolated SSPEs. Incidental SSPE is found casually in asymptomatic patients, usually by diagnostic imaging performed for other reasons (for example routine computed tomography (CT) for cancer staging in oncologic patients). Patients with isolated SSPE or incidental PE may have a more benign clinical presentation compared to those with proximal PEs. However, the clinical significance and prognosis in these patients has to be studied to evaluate whether anticoagulation therapy is required. \\nReview question \\nWhat is the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulation therapy versus control in patients with subsegmental pulmonary embolism (SSPE) or incidental SSPE? \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe did not identify any studies that met the inclusion criteria.\\nKey results \\nThere is no evidence from randomised controlled trials (current to 26 November 2019) on the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulation therapy versus control in patients with isolated subsegmental pulmonary embolism (SSPE) or incidental SSPE. We cannot draw any conclusions. Well\\u2010conducted research is required before informed practice decisions can be made. \\nQuality of evidence \\nIt is not possible to review methodological quality in the absence of studies eligible for inclusion in the review. \\n\",\n          \"How accurate are rapid antigen tests for diagnosing COVID\\u201019?\\nKey messages \\n\\u2022 Rapid antigen tests are most accurate when they are used in people who have signs or symptoms of COVID\\u201019, especially during the first week of illness. People who test negative may still be infected. \\n\\u2022 Rapid antigen tests are considerably less accurate when they are used in people with no signs or symptoms of infection, but do perform better in people who have been in contact with someone who has confirmed COVID\\u201019. \\n\\u2022 The accuracy of rapid antigen tests varies between tests that are produced by different manufacturers and there is a lack of evidence for many commercially available tests. \\nWhat are rapid point\\u2010of\\u2010care antigen tests for COVID\\u201019? \\nRapid point\\u2010of\\u2010care tests aim to confirm or rule out COVID\\u201019 infection in people with or without COVID\\u201019 symptoms. They: \\n\\u2022 are portable, so they can be used wherever the patient is (at the point\\u2010of\\u2010care) or in non\\u2010healthcare settings such as in the home; \\n\\u2022 are easy to perform, with a minimum amount of extra equipment or complicated preparation steps; \\n\\u2022 are less expensive than standard laboratory tests;\\n\\u2022 do not require a specialist operator or setting; and\\n\\u2022 provide results \\u2018while you wait\\u2019.\\nFor this review we were interested in rapid antigen tests, sometimes referred to as \\u2018lateral flow tests\\u2019. These tests identify proteins on the virus in samples taken from the nose or throat. They come in disposable plastic cassettes, similar to over\\u2010the\\u2010counter pregnancy tests. \\nWhy is this question important? \\nPeople with suspected COVID\\u201019 need to know quickly whether they are infected, so that they can self\\u2010isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. Currently, COVID\\u201019 infection is confirmed by a laboratory test called RT\\u2010PCR, which uses specialist equipment and often takes at least 24 hours to produce a result. \\nIn many places, rapid antigen tests have opened access to testing for many more people, with and without symptoms, and in locations other than healthcare settings. Faster diagnosis of COVID\\u201019 infection could allow people to take appropriate action more quickly, with the potential to reduce the spread of COVID\\u201019, but it is important to understand how accurate they are and the best way to use them. \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nWe wanted to know whether commercially available, rapid point\\u2010of\\u2010care antigen tests are accurate enough to diagnose COVID\\u201019 infection reliably, and to find out if accuracy differs in people with and without symptoms. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe looked for studies that measured the accuracy of any commercially produced rapid antigen test in people who were also tested for COVID\\u201019 using RT\\u2010PCR. People could be tested in hospital, in the community or in their own homes. Studies could test people with or without symptoms. \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe included 155 studies in the review. The main results are based on 152 studies investigating a total of 100,462 nose or throat samples; COVID\\u201019 was confirmed in 16,822 of these samples. Studies investigated 49 different antigen tests. Around 60% of studies took place in Europe. \\nMain results \\nIn people with confirmed COVID\\u201019, antigen tests correctly identified COVID\\u201019 infection in an average of 73% of people with symptoms, compared to 55% of people without symptoms. Tests were most accurate when used in the first week after symptoms began (an average of 82% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). This is likely to be because people have the most virus in their system in the first days after they are infected. For people with no symptoms, tests were most accurate in people likely to have been in contact with a case of COVID\\u201019 infection (an average of 64% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). \\nIn people who did not have COVID\\u201019, antigen tests correctly ruled out infection in 99.6% of people with symptoms and 99.7% of people without symptoms. \\nDifferent brands of tests varied in accuracy. Summary results (combined from more than one study per test brand) for seven tests met World Health Organization (WHO) standards as \\u2018acceptable\\u2019 for confirming and ruling out COVID\\u201019 in people with signs and symptoms of COVID\\u201019. Two more tests met the WHO acceptable standard in one study each. No test met this standard when evaluated in people without symptoms. \\nUsing summary results for symptomatic people tested during the first week after symptoms began, if 1000 people with symptoms had the antigen test, and 50 (5%) of them really had COVID\\u201019: \\n\\u2022 45 people would test positive for COVID\\u201019. Of these, 5 people (11%) would not have COVID\\u201019 (false positive result). \\n\\u2022 955 people would test negative for COVID\\u201019. Of these, 10 people (1.0%) would actually have COVID\\u201019 (false negative result). \\nIn people with no symptoms of COVID\\u201019 the number of confirmed cases is expected to be much lower than in people with symptoms. Using summary results for people with no known exposure to COVID\\u201019 in a bigger population of 10,000 people with no symptoms, where 50 (0.5%) of them really had COVID\\u201019: \\n\\u2022 62 people would test positive for COVID\\u201019. Of these, 30 people (48%) would not have COVID\\u201019 (false positive result). \\n\\u2022 9938 people would test negative for COVID\\u201019. Of these, 18 people (0.2%) would actually have COVID\\u201019 (false negative result). \\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \\nIn general, studies used relatively rigorous methods, particularly for selecting participants and performing the tests. Sometimes studies did not perform the test on the people for whom it was intended and did not follow the manufacturers\\u2019 instructions for using the test. Sometimes the tests were not carried out at the point of care. Studies used less rigorous methods for confirming the presence or absence of COVID\\u201019 infection; 91% of studies relied on a single negative RT\\u2010PCR result as evidence of no COVID\\u201019 infection. Results from different test brands varied, and relatively few studies directly compared one test brand with another. Finally, not all studies gave enough information about their participants for us to judge how long they had had symptoms, or even whether or not they had symptoms. \\nWhat does this mean? \\nIn people with symptoms, some rapid antigen tests are accurate enough to replace RT\\u2010PCR, especially for ruling in the presence of infection. Alternatively, where RT\\u2010PCR is available, rapid antigen tests could be used to select which people with symptoms require further testing with RT\\u2010PCR, thereby reducing the burden on laboratory services. This would be most useful when quick decisions are needed about patient care, to identify outbreaks, to allow people to self\\u2010isolate more quickly, or to initiate contact tracing. Rapid antigen tests are less good at ruling out infection in symptomatic people \\u2010 individuals who receive a negative rapid antigen test result may still be infected. \\nRapid antigen tests are less accurate when used in people with no symptoms of COVID\\u201019. More evidence is needed to understand the accuracy of rapid testing in people without symptoms and the extent to which repeated testing strategies can lead to reduced transmission, either for tests carried out at home or in non\\u2010healthcare settings such as schools. There is no independent evidence to support the use of many test brands. More direct comparisons of test brands are needed, with testers following manufacturers\\u2019 instructions. \\nHow up\\u2010to\\u2010date is this review? \\nThis review updates our previous review and includes evidence published up to 8 March 2021. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"simplified_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Plain Title\\nDo fertility drugs raise the risk of ovarian cancer?\\n\\nRationale\\n- Some drugs help women ovulate to treat trouble getting pregnant.  \\n- People worry these drugs could raise cancer risk.  \\n- Infertility itself can raise the risk of ovarian cancer.  \\n- This review looks at many studies to see if drugs add risk.\\n\\nTrial Design\\n- This is a systematic review of published studies.  \\n- It looks at women treated for infertility with fertility drugs, and compares them to others.  \\n- The total number of women studied is about 4.7 million in 37 studies.  \\n- Follow-up times varied. Newer studies have longer follow-up and more detail on dose and cycles.\\n\\nResults\\n- Overall, 37 studies with about 4.7 million women did not show strong ovarian cancer risk.  \\n- In 12 US case studies, risk rose, especially in women who had no children.  \\n- One study found more serous borderline tumors after cycles of progesterone, but cases were few.  \\n- Some studies link clomiphene to more borderline tumors in infertile women.  \\n- Infertility itself is a risk factor for ovarian cancer. Results must be read with care because many studies were small or flawed.\",\n          \"Plain Title\\nAre blood thinners good for small blood clots in the lungs?\\n\\nRationale\\nA pulmonary embolism (PE) is a dangerous blood clot in the lungs. It can block blood flow and is a major cause of death. Modern scans find more and more small clots in the outer parts of the lungs. Some clots are found by chance when a scan is done for another reason; this is called incidental SSPE. These small or incidental clots can cause few symptoms, but it is not clear what the best treatment is.\\n\\nDoctors use blood thinners, also called anticoagulants, to prevent more clots. But for small or incidentally found clots, we need to know if this treatment helps and if it is safe. The idea is that thinning the blood might stop more clots and help symptoms, but it could also raise the risk of bleeding. This study looked for solid evidence from good trials to answer these questions. The question was: do blood thinners work well and are they safe for people with SSPE or incidental SSPE?\\n\\nTrial Design\\nThis work is a review of past studies. The researchers searched for randomized trials. In a randomized trial, people are placed into two groups by chance. One group would get the blood thinner, the other would not, or would get a different treatment. The goal was to learn about safety and whether symptoms improve.\\n\\nThe study looked for adults with SSPE or incidental SSPE. It did not restrict by sex. The plan was to report what happened to people in the trials, and how long they stayed in the study. However, in this review, no eligible trials were found. Because of this, there were no people to follow and no study time to report. The search covered research available up to November 26, 2019.\\n\\nResults\\nThe main finding is simple: there are no randomized trials that test whether blood thinners help people with isolated SSPE or incidental SSPE. Because no trials met the criteria, we cannot say if the medicine helps or if it is safe in this situation.\\n\\nThis means there is no solid evidence to guide doctors or patients. Without good trials, we cannot make strong conclusions or recommendations. More careful, high\\u2011quality research is needed. If new studies are done, they should clearly compare blood thinners with not using them and report safe use and any benefits. Only then can doctors decide the best care for people with these small or incidental lung clots.\",\n          \"Plain Title\\nAre fast COVID tests good at finding infection?\\n\\nRationale\\nCOVID-19 is a lung illness that can spread easily. It can make people sick and keep them from work or school. Quick tests are useful because they can give results right away and help people isolate sooner. These tests are called rapid antigen tests. They look for a protein from the virus in a swab taken from the nose or throat. They are cheaper and easier to use than lab tests, and you can do them outside of a hospital.\\n\\nResearchers wanted to know how well these quick tests work. Do they correctly tell who is infected? Does the test work better for people with symptoms than for those with no symptoms? The hope is to guide using these tests in clinics, at home, or other places so people can act fast and stop the virus from spreading.\\n\\nTrial Design\\nThis work is a careful review of many studies, not one single trial. The researchers looked at studies that tested people with rapid antigen tests and also used a laboratory test called RT-PCR to confirm if someone really had the virus. They included tests done in hospitals, in the community, and at home. They looked at people with symptoms and people without symptoms.\\n\\nThe review covered a lot of ground. It included many different tests from many makers. It also included people of different ages and both sexes. In most studies, people only took one test and waited a short time for the result, since these tests give answers while you wait. The evidence in the review was collected up to early March 2021.\\n\\nResults\\nWhat did the researchers find about accuracy?\\n\\n- For people who truly have COVID-19 and show symptoms, the rapid test found the infection in about 7 out of 10 people. It missed the infection in about 3 out of 10 people with symptoms.\\n\\n- For people who have COVID-19 but have no symptoms, the test picked up the infection in about 5 out of 10 people. It missed about half of the infections.\\n\\n- The first week after symptoms begin is the best time to use the test. In that period, the test found infection in about 8 out of 10 people with symptoms.\\n\\n- For people who do not have symptoms but were around someone with COVID-19, the test found about 6 out of 10 infections.\\n\\n- When the person does not have COVID-19, the test correctly says \\u201cnot infected\\u201d most of the time. About 996 to 997 out of 1,000 people who do not have the virus test negative.\\n\\n- Results varied by which brand of test was used. Some tests met the World Health Organization\\u2019s acceptable standards for people with symptoms. A few tests met the standard in one study each. No test met the standard for people without symptoms.\\n\\n- In a large group of 10,000 people with no symptoms and no known exposure, about 50 people really had COVID. Of those 50, about 62 would test positive, but about 30 of those positives would be false positives. Among the 9,938 people who did not have COVID, about 18 would be false negatives.\\n\\nWhat this means for patients and care\\n- In people with symptoms, some rapid tests can be used to help confirm infection and decide if more tests are needed. They may help speed up care, stop spread, and guide actions like self\\u2011isolation and starting treatment.\\n- A negative rapid test in someone with symptoms does not completely rule out infection. A person can still have COVID-19 and may need a follow\\u2011up test, especially if symptoms remain.\\n- In people who have no symptoms, these tests are less reliable. They miss more infections and can give more false alarms. More evidence is needed to know how best to use them in schools, homes, or other non\\u2011healthcare settings.\\n- Results can vary by test brand, and not all brands have enough evidence to show how well they work. It is helpful to follow local guidelines and consider confirmatory lab testing when needed.\\n\\nConclusions from the researchers\\nRapid antigen tests can be helpful for people with symptoms to find infection quickly and may reduce the burden on lab testing. They work best in the first days after symptoms start. They are less accurate for people without symptoms. More studies are needed to compare different test brands directly and to see how repeated testing might improve accuracy, especially in people without symptoms.\\n\\nNotes for readers\\n- RT-PCR is a lab test that looks for the virus\\u2019s genetic material and is usually more accurate, but it takes longer.\\n- A rapid antigen test gives results in minutes, but its accuracy depends on symptoms, timing, and the brand of test used.\\n- Always follow health guidelines and talk with a health care provider if you have exposure or symptoms and get a test result that does not match how you feel.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertscore\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.017630563943562907,\n        \"min\": 0.7953708171844482,\n        \"max\": 0.8343802094459534,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8343802094459534,\n          0.8017697334289551,\n          0.7953708171844482\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

There is uncertainty about the safety of these drugs and their potential risk of causing cancer. Moreover, it has already been shown that infertility itself increases the risk of ovarian cancer. \\nThe aim of the review We aimed with this updated systematic review to summarise current published research on the risk of ovarian cancer in subfertile women treated with fertility drugs compared to the general population and to subfertile women not treated with fertility drugs. \\nWhat are the main findings? Overall, based on 37 studies, which included a total of 4,684,724 women, we did not find enough strong evidence suggesting a potentially higher risk of ovarian cancer in women treated with fertility drugs. \\nA cumulative analysis of 12 case\\u2010control studies from the USA revealed increased risk of ovarian cancer in women using fertility drugs, and this risk was higher in nulliparous women (women who have not given birth) when compared to multiparous women (women who have given birth to more than one child). One of the 37 included studies reported a two\\u2010fold increase in development of serous borderline ovarian tumour in women after more than four cycles of progesterone; however the number of cases included in this group was very small. One cohort study also suggested an increased risk of borderline ovarian tumour in infertile women treated with clomiphene citrate when compared to infertile women who did not undergo treatment to conceive. \\nQuality of the evidence Studies showing an increase in the risk of ovarian cancer were of low methodological quality, with short follow\\u2010up periods and with lack of adjustment for important confounding factors; therefore the results are too unreliable. However, compared with older studies, recent studies have tended to report both the dose and the number of cycles of infertility drugs and have included more contemporary drug regimens; this has made the final results more reliable. \\nWhat are the conclusions? Infertility has been found to be an important risk factor for ovarian cancer. However, the association between infertility drugs and ovarian cancer needs to be addressed with consideration of other factors such as age, body mass index, parity, genetic factors (i.e. family history for ovarian cancer), and aetiology of the infertility, along with longer follow\\u2010up times. \\n\",\n          \"Anticoagulant treatment for subsegmental pulmonary embolism\\nBackground \\nAcute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cause of death, accounting for 50,000 to 200,000 deaths annually. It is the third most common cause of mortality among the cardiovascular diseases, after coronary artery disease and stroke. The advent of multi\\u2010detector computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has allowed better assessment of PE regarding visualisation of the peripheral pulmonary arteries, increasing its rate of diagnosis. More cases of peripheral PEs, such as isolated subsegmental PE (SSPE) and incidental PE, have thereby been identified. These two conditions are usually found in patients with few or no classic symptoms such as coughing (including coughing up blood), chest or upper back pain, acute shortness of breath, or general or specific failure of the circulation that is either cardiac or peripheral in nature. However, in patients with an impaired cardiac and pulmonary condition the classic PE symptoms can be found with isolated SSPEs. Incidental SSPE is found casually in asymptomatic patients, usually by diagnostic imaging performed for other reasons (for example routine computed tomography (CT) for cancer staging in oncologic patients). Patients with isolated SSPE or incidental PE may have a more benign clinical presentation compared to those with proximal PEs. However, the clinical significance and prognosis in these patients has to be studied to evaluate whether anticoagulation therapy is required. \\nReview question \\nWhat is the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulation therapy versus control in patients with subsegmental pulmonary embolism (SSPE) or incidental SSPE? \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe did not identify any studies that met the inclusion criteria.\\nKey results \\nThere is no evidence from randomised controlled trials (current to 26 November 2019) on the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulation therapy versus control in patients with isolated subsegmental pulmonary embolism (SSPE) or incidental SSPE. We cannot draw any conclusions. Well\\u2010conducted research is required before informed practice decisions can be made. \\nQuality of evidence \\nIt is not possible to review methodological quality in the absence of studies eligible for inclusion in the review. \\n\",\n          \"How accurate are rapid antigen tests for diagnosing COVID\\u201019?\\nKey messages \\n\\u2022 Rapid antigen tests are most accurate when they are used in people who have signs or symptoms of COVID\\u201019, especially during the first week of illness. People who test negative may still be infected. \\n\\u2022 Rapid antigen tests are considerably less accurate when they are used in people with no signs or symptoms of infection, but do perform better in people who have been in contact with someone who has confirmed COVID\\u201019. \\n\\u2022 The accuracy of rapid antigen tests varies between tests that are produced by different manufacturers and there is a lack of evidence for many commercially available tests. \\nWhat are rapid point\\u2010of\\u2010care antigen tests for COVID\\u201019? \\nRapid point\\u2010of\\u2010care tests aim to confirm or rule out COVID\\u201019 infection in people with or without COVID\\u201019 symptoms. They: \\n\\u2022 are portable, so they can be used wherever the patient is (at the point\\u2010of\\u2010care) or in non\\u2010healthcare settings such as in the home; \\n\\u2022 are easy to perform, with a minimum amount of extra equipment or complicated preparation steps; \\n\\u2022 are less expensive than standard laboratory tests;\\n\\u2022 do not require a specialist operator or setting; and\\n\\u2022 provide results \\u2018while you wait\\u2019.\\nFor this review we were interested in rapid antigen tests, sometimes referred to as \\u2018lateral flow tests\\u2019. These tests identify proteins on the virus in samples taken from the nose or throat. They come in disposable plastic cassettes, similar to over\\u2010the\\u2010counter pregnancy tests. \\nWhy is this question important? \\nPeople with suspected COVID\\u201019 need to know quickly whether they are infected, so that they can self\\u2010isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. Currently, COVID\\u201019 infection is confirmed by a laboratory test called RT\\u2010PCR, which uses specialist equipment and often takes at least 24 hours to produce a result. \\nIn many places, rapid antigen tests have opened access to testing for many more people, with and without symptoms, and in locations other than healthcare settings. Faster diagnosis of COVID\\u201019 infection could allow people to take appropriate action more quickly, with the potential to reduce the spread of COVID\\u201019, but it is important to understand how accurate they are and the best way to use them. \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nWe wanted to know whether commercially available, rapid point\\u2010of\\u2010care antigen tests are accurate enough to diagnose COVID\\u201019 infection reliably, and to find out if accuracy differs in people with and without symptoms. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe looked for studies that measured the accuracy of any commercially produced rapid antigen test in people who were also tested for COVID\\u201019 using RT\\u2010PCR. People could be tested in hospital, in the community or in their own homes. Studies could test people with or without symptoms. \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe included 155 studies in the review. The main results are based on 152 studies investigating a total of 100,462 nose or throat samples; COVID\\u201019 was confirmed in 16,822 of these samples. Studies investigated 49 different antigen tests. Around 60% of studies took place in Europe. \\nMain results \\nIn people with confirmed COVID\\u201019, antigen tests correctly identified COVID\\u201019 infection in an average of 73% of people with symptoms, compared to 55% of people without symptoms. Tests were most accurate when used in the first week after symptoms began (an average of 82% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). This is likely to be because people have the most virus in their system in the first days after they are infected. For people with no symptoms, tests were most accurate in people likely to have been in contact with a case of COVID\\u201019 infection (an average of 64% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). \\nIn people who did not have COVID\\u201019, antigen tests correctly ruled out infection in 99.6% of people with symptoms and 99.7% of people without symptoms. \\nDifferent brands of tests varied in accuracy. Summary results (combined from more than one study per test brand) for seven tests met World Health Organization (WHO) standards as \\u2018acceptable\\u2019 for confirming and ruling out COVID\\u201019 in people with signs and symptoms of COVID\\u201019. Two more tests met the WHO acceptable standard in one study each. No test met this standard when evaluated in people without symptoms. \\nUsing summary results for symptomatic people tested during the first week after symptoms began, if 1000 people with symptoms had the antigen test, and 50 (5%) of them really had COVID\\u201019: \\n\\u2022 45 people would test positive for COVID\\u201019. Of these, 5 people (11%) would not have COVID\\u201019 (false positive result). \\n\\u2022 955 people would test negative for COVID\\u201019. Of these, 10 people (1.0%) would actually have COVID\\u201019 (false negative result). \\nIn people with no symptoms of COVID\\u201019 the number of confirmed cases is expected to be much lower than in people with symptoms. Using summary results for people with no known exposure to COVID\\u201019 in a bigger population of 10,000 people with no symptoms, where 50 (0.5%) of them really had COVID\\u201019: \\n\\u2022 62 people would test positive for COVID\\u201019. Of these, 30 people (48%) would not have COVID\\u201019 (false positive result). \\n\\u2022 9938 people would test negative for COVID\\u201019. Of these, 18 people (0.2%) would actually have COVID\\u201019 (false negative result). \\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \\nIn general, studies used relatively rigorous methods, particularly for selecting participants and performing the tests. Sometimes studies did not perform the test on the people for whom it was intended and did not follow the manufacturers\\u2019 instructions for using the test. Sometimes the tests were not carried out at the point of care. Studies used less rigorous methods for confirming the presence or absence of COVID\\u201019 infection; 91% of studies relied on a single negative RT\\u2010PCR result as evidence of no COVID\\u201019 infection. Results from different test brands varied, and relatively few studies directly compared one test brand with another. Finally, not all studies gave enough information about their participants for us to judge how long they had had symptoms, or even whether or not they had symptoms. \\nWhat does this mean? \\nIn people with symptoms, some rapid antigen tests are accurate enough to replace RT\\u2010PCR, especially for ruling in the presence of infection. Alternatively, where RT\\u2010PCR is available, rapid antigen tests could be used to select which people with symptoms require further testing with RT\\u2010PCR, thereby reducing the burden on laboratory services. This would be most useful when quick decisions are needed about patient care, to identify outbreaks, to allow people to self\\u2010isolate more quickly, or to initiate contact tracing. Rapid antigen tests are less good at ruling out infection in symptomatic people \\u2010 individuals who receive a negative rapid antigen test result may still be infected. \\nRapid antigen tests are less accurate when used in people with no symptoms of COVID\\u201019. More evidence is needed to understand the accuracy of rapid testing in people without symptoms and the extent to which repeated testing strategies can lead to reduced transmission, either for tests carried out at home or in non\\u2010healthcare settings such as schools. There is no independent evidence to support the use of many test brands. More direct comparisons of test brands are needed, with testers following manufacturers\\u2019 instructions. \\nHow up\\u2010to\\u2010date is this review? \\nThis review updates our previous review and includes evidence published up to 8 March 2021. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"simplified_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Plain Title\\nDo fertility drugs raise the risk of ovarian cancer?\\n\\nRationale\\n- Some drugs help women ovulate to treat trouble getting pregnant.  \\n- People worry these drugs could raise cancer risk.  \\n- Infertility itself can raise the risk of ovarian cancer.  \\n- This review looks at many studies to see if drugs add risk.\\n\\nTrial Design\\n- This is a systematic review of published studies.  \\n- It looks at women treated for infertility with fertility drugs, and compares them to others.  \\n- The total number of women studied is about 4.7 million in 37 studies.  \\n- Follow-up times varied. Newer studies have longer follow-up and more detail on dose and cycles.\\n\\nResults\\n- Overall, 37 studies with about 4.7 million women did not show strong ovarian cancer risk.  \\n- In 12 US case studies, risk rose, especially in women who had no children.  \\n- One study found more serous borderline tumors after cycles of progesterone, but cases were few.  \\n- Some studies link clomiphene to more borderline tumors in infertile women.  \\n- Infertility itself is a risk factor for ovarian cancer. Results must be read with care because many studies were small or flawed.\",\n          \"Plain Title\\nAre blood thinners good for small blood clots in the lungs?\\n\\nRationale\\nA pulmonary embolism (PE) is a dangerous blood clot in the lungs. It can block blood flow and is a major cause of death. Modern scans find more and more small clots in the outer parts of the lungs. Some clots are found by chance when a scan is done for another reason; this is called incidental SSPE. These small or incidental clots can cause few symptoms, but it is not clear what the best treatment is.\\n\\nDoctors use blood thinners, also called anticoagulants, to prevent more clots. But for small or incidentally found clots, we need to know if this treatment helps and if it is safe. The idea is that thinning the blood might stop more clots and help symptoms, but it could also raise the risk of bleeding. This study looked for solid evidence from good trials to answer these questions. The question was: do blood thinners work well and are they safe for people with SSPE or incidental SSPE?\\n\\nTrial Design\\nThis work is a review of past studies. The researchers searched for randomized trials. In a randomized trial, people are placed into two groups by chance. One group would get the blood thinner, the other would not, or would get a different treatment. The goal was to learn about safety and whether symptoms improve.\\n\\nThe study looked for adults with SSPE or incidental SSPE. It did not restrict by sex. The plan was to report what happened to people in the trials, and how long they stayed in the study. However, in this review, no eligible trials were found. Because of this, there were no people to follow and no study time to report. The search covered research available up to November 26, 2019.\\n\\nResults\\nThe main finding is simple: there are no randomized trials that test whether blood thinners help people with isolated SSPE or incidental SSPE. Because no trials met the criteria, we cannot say if the medicine helps or if it is safe in this situation.\\n\\nThis means there is no solid evidence to guide doctors or patients. Without good trials, we cannot make strong conclusions or recommendations. More careful, high\\u2011quality research is needed. If new studies are done, they should clearly compare blood thinners with not using them and report safe use and any benefits. Only then can doctors decide the best care for people with these small or incidental lung clots.\",\n          \"Plain Title\\nAre fast COVID tests good at finding infection?\\n\\nRationale\\nCOVID-19 is a lung illness that can spread easily. It can make people sick and keep them from work or school. Quick tests are useful because they can give results right away and help people isolate sooner. These tests are called rapid antigen tests. They look for a protein from the virus in a swab taken from the nose or throat. They are cheaper and easier to use than lab tests, and you can do them outside of a hospital.\\n\\nResearchers wanted to know how well these quick tests work. Do they correctly tell who is infected? Does the test work better for people with symptoms than for those with no symptoms? The hope is to guide using these tests in clinics, at home, or other places so people can act fast and stop the virus from spreading.\\n\\nTrial Design\\nThis work is a careful review of many studies, not one single trial. The researchers looked at studies that tested people with rapid antigen tests and also used a laboratory test called RT-PCR to confirm if someone really had the virus. They included tests done in hospitals, in the community, and at home. They looked at people with symptoms and people without symptoms.\\n\\nThe review covered a lot of ground. It included many different tests from many makers. It also included people of different ages and both sexes. In most studies, people only took one test and waited a short time for the result, since these tests give answers while you wait. The evidence in the review was collected up to early March 2021.\\n\\nResults\\nWhat did the researchers find about accuracy?\\n\\n- For people who truly have COVID-19 and show symptoms, the rapid test found the infection in about 7 out of 10 people. It missed the infection in about 3 out of 10 people with symptoms.\\n\\n- For people who have COVID-19 but have no symptoms, the test picked up the infection in about 5 out of 10 people. It missed about half of the infections.\\n\\n- The first week after symptoms begin is the best time to use the test. In that period, the test found infection in about 8 out of 10 people with symptoms.\\n\\n- For people who do not have symptoms but were around someone with COVID-19, the test found about 6 out of 10 infections.\\n\\n- When the person does not have COVID-19, the test correctly says \\u201cnot infected\\u201d most of the time. About 996 to 997 out of 1,000 people who do not have the virus test negative.\\n\\n- Results varied by which brand of test was used. Some tests met the World Health Organization\\u2019s acceptable standards for people with symptoms. A few tests met the standard in one study each. No test met the standard for people without symptoms.\\n\\n- In a large group of 10,000 people with no symptoms and no known exposure, about 50 people really had COVID. Of those 50, about 62 would test positive, but about 30 of those positives would be false positives. Among the 9,938 people who did not have COVID, about 18 would be false negatives.\\n\\nWhat this means for patients and care\\n- In people with symptoms, some rapid tests can be used to help confirm infection and decide if more tests are needed. They may help speed up care, stop spread, and guide actions like self\\u2011isolation and starting treatment.\\n- A negative rapid test in someone with symptoms does not completely rule out infection. A person can still have COVID-19 and may need a follow\\u2011up test, especially if symptoms remain.\\n- In people who have no symptoms, these tests are less reliable. They miss more infections and can give more false alarms. More evidence is needed to know how best to use them in schools, homes, or other non\\u2011healthcare settings.\\n- Results can vary by test brand, and not all brands have enough evidence to show how well they work. It is helpful to follow local guidelines and consider confirmatory lab testing when needed.\\n\\nConclusions from the researchers\\nRapid antigen tests can be helpful for people with symptoms to find infection quickly and may reduce the burden on lab testing. They work best in the first days after symptoms start. They are less accurate for people without symptoms. More studies are needed to compare different test brands directly and to see how repeated testing might improve accuracy, especially in people without symptoms.\\n\\nNotes for readers\\n- RT-PCR is a lab test that looks for the virus\\u2019s genetic material and is usually more accurate, but it takes longer.\\n- A rapid antigen test gives results in minutes, but its accuracy depends on symptoms, timing, and the brand of test used.\\n- Always follow health guidelines and talk with a health care provider if you have exposure or symptoms and get a test result that does not match how you feel.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertscore\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.017630563943562907,\n        \"min\": 0.7953708171844482,\n        \"max\": 0.8343802094459534,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8343802094459534,\n          0.8017697334289551,\n          0.7953708171844482\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"alignscore\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.19516743735170503,\n        \"min\": 0.31245750188827515,\n        \"max\": 0.856458306312561,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.856458306312561,\n          0.31245750188827515,\n          0.6005575656890869\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

There is uncertainty about the safety of these drugs and their potential risk of causing cancer. Moreover, it has already been shown that infertility itself increases the risk of ovarian cancer. \\nThe aim of the review We aimed with this updated systematic review to summarise current published research on the risk of ovarian cancer in subfertile women treated with fertility drugs compared to the general population and to subfertile women not treated with fertility drugs. \\nWhat are the main findings? Overall, based on 37 studies, which included a total of 4,684,724 women, we did not find enough strong evidence suggesting a potentially higher risk of ovarian cancer in women treated with fertility drugs. \\nA cumulative analysis of 12 case\\u2010control studies from the USA revealed increased risk of ovarian cancer in women using fertility drugs, and this risk was higher in nulliparous women (women who have not given birth) when compared to multiparous women (women who have given birth to more than one child). One of the 37 included studies reported a two\\u2010fold increase in development of serous borderline ovarian tumour in women after more than four cycles of progesterone; however the number of cases included in this group was very small. One cohort study also suggested an increased risk of borderline ovarian tumour in infertile women treated with clomiphene citrate when compared to infertile women who did not undergo treatment to conceive. \\nQuality of the evidence Studies showing an increase in the risk of ovarian cancer were of low methodological quality, with short follow\\u2010up periods and with lack of adjustment for important confounding factors; therefore the results are too unreliable. However, compared with older studies, recent studies have tended to report both the dose and the number of cycles of infertility drugs and have included more contemporary drug regimens; this has made the final results more reliable. \\nWhat are the conclusions? Infertility has been found to be an important risk factor for ovarian cancer. However, the association between infertility drugs and ovarian cancer needs to be addressed with consideration of other factors such as age, body mass index, parity, genetic factors (i.e. family history for ovarian cancer), and aetiology of the infertility, along with longer follow\\u2010up times. \\n\",\n          \"Anticoagulant treatment for subsegmental pulmonary embolism\\nBackground \\nAcute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cause of death, accounting for 50,000 to 200,000 deaths annually. It is the third most common cause of mortality among the cardiovascular diseases, after coronary artery disease and stroke. The advent of multi\\u2010detector computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has allowed better assessment of PE regarding visualisation of the peripheral pulmonary arteries, increasing its rate of diagnosis. More cases of peripheral PEs, such as isolated subsegmental PE (SSPE) and incidental PE, have thereby been identified. These two conditions are usually found in patients with few or no classic symptoms such as coughing (including coughing up blood), chest or upper back pain, acute shortness of breath, or general or specific failure of the circulation that is either cardiac or peripheral in nature. However, in patients with an impaired cardiac and pulmonary condition the classic PE symptoms can be found with isolated SSPEs. Incidental SSPE is found casually in asymptomatic patients, usually by diagnostic imaging performed for other reasons (for example routine computed tomography (CT) for cancer staging in oncologic patients). Patients with isolated SSPE or incidental PE may have a more benign clinical presentation compared to those with proximal PEs. However, the clinical significance and prognosis in these patients has to be studied to evaluate whether anticoagulation therapy is required. \\nReview question \\nWhat is the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulation therapy versus control in patients with subsegmental pulmonary embolism (SSPE) or incidental SSPE? \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe did not identify any studies that met the inclusion criteria.\\nKey results \\nThere is no evidence from randomised controlled trials (current to 26 November 2019) on the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulation therapy versus control in patients with isolated subsegmental pulmonary embolism (SSPE) or incidental SSPE. We cannot draw any conclusions. Well\\u2010conducted research is required before informed practice decisions can be made. \\nQuality of evidence \\nIt is not possible to review methodological quality in the absence of studies eligible for inclusion in the review. \\n\",\n          \"How accurate are rapid antigen tests for diagnosing COVID\\u201019?\\nKey messages \\n\\u2022 Rapid antigen tests are most accurate when they are used in people who have signs or symptoms of COVID\\u201019, especially during the first week of illness. People who test negative may still be infected. \\n\\u2022 Rapid antigen tests are considerably less accurate when they are used in people with no signs or symptoms of infection, but do perform better in people who have been in contact with someone who has confirmed COVID\\u201019. \\n\\u2022 The accuracy of rapid antigen tests varies between tests that are produced by different manufacturers and there is a lack of evidence for many commercially available tests. \\nWhat are rapid point\\u2010of\\u2010care antigen tests for COVID\\u201019? \\nRapid point\\u2010of\\u2010care tests aim to confirm or rule out COVID\\u201019 infection in people with or without COVID\\u201019 symptoms. They: \\n\\u2022 are portable, so they can be used wherever the patient is (at the point\\u2010of\\u2010care) or in non\\u2010healthcare settings such as in the home; \\n\\u2022 are easy to perform, with a minimum amount of extra equipment or complicated preparation steps; \\n\\u2022 are less expensive than standard laboratory tests;\\n\\u2022 do not require a specialist operator or setting; and\\n\\u2022 provide results \\u2018while you wait\\u2019.\\nFor this review we were interested in rapid antigen tests, sometimes referred to as \\u2018lateral flow tests\\u2019. These tests identify proteins on the virus in samples taken from the nose or throat. They come in disposable plastic cassettes, similar to over\\u2010the\\u2010counter pregnancy tests. \\nWhy is this question important? \\nPeople with suspected COVID\\u201019 need to know quickly whether they are infected, so that they can self\\u2010isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. Currently, COVID\\u201019 infection is confirmed by a laboratory test called RT\\u2010PCR, which uses specialist equipment and often takes at least 24 hours to produce a result. \\nIn many places, rapid antigen tests have opened access to testing for many more people, with and without symptoms, and in locations other than healthcare settings. Faster diagnosis of COVID\\u201019 infection could allow people to take appropriate action more quickly, with the potential to reduce the spread of COVID\\u201019, but it is important to understand how accurate they are and the best way to use them. \\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nWe wanted to know whether commercially available, rapid point\\u2010of\\u2010care antigen tests are accurate enough to diagnose COVID\\u201019 infection reliably, and to find out if accuracy differs in people with and without symptoms. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe looked for studies that measured the accuracy of any commercially produced rapid antigen test in people who were also tested for COVID\\u201019 using RT\\u2010PCR. People could be tested in hospital, in the community or in their own homes. Studies could test people with or without symptoms. \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe included 155 studies in the review. The main results are based on 152 studies investigating a total of 100,462 nose or throat samples; COVID\\u201019 was confirmed in 16,822 of these samples. Studies investigated 49 different antigen tests. Around 60% of studies took place in Europe. \\nMain results \\nIn people with confirmed COVID\\u201019, antigen tests correctly identified COVID\\u201019 infection in an average of 73% of people with symptoms, compared to 55% of people without symptoms. Tests were most accurate when used in the first week after symptoms began (an average of 82% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). This is likely to be because people have the most virus in their system in the first days after they are infected. For people with no symptoms, tests were most accurate in people likely to have been in contact with a case of COVID\\u201019 infection (an average of 64% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). \\nIn people who did not have COVID\\u201019, antigen tests correctly ruled out infection in 99.6% of people with symptoms and 99.7% of people without symptoms. \\nDifferent brands of tests varied in accuracy. Summary results (combined from more than one study per test brand) for seven tests met World Health Organization (WHO) standards as \\u2018acceptable\\u2019 for confirming and ruling out COVID\\u201019 in people with signs and symptoms of COVID\\u201019. Two more tests met the WHO acceptable standard in one study each. No test met this standard when evaluated in people without symptoms. \\nUsing summary results for symptomatic people tested during the first week after symptoms began, if 1000 people with symptoms had the antigen test, and 50 (5%) of them really had COVID\\u201019: \\n\\u2022 45 people would test positive for COVID\\u201019. Of these, 5 people (11%) would not have COVID\\u201019 (false positive result). \\n\\u2022 955 people would test negative for COVID\\u201019. Of these, 10 people (1.0%) would actually have COVID\\u201019 (false negative result). \\nIn people with no symptoms of COVID\\u201019 the number of confirmed cases is expected to be much lower than in people with symptoms. Using summary results for people with no known exposure to COVID\\u201019 in a bigger population of 10,000 people with no symptoms, where 50 (0.5%) of them really had COVID\\u201019: \\n\\u2022 62 people would test positive for COVID\\u201019. Of these, 30 people (48%) would not have COVID\\u201019 (false positive result). \\n\\u2022 9938 people would test negative for COVID\\u201019. Of these, 18 people (0.2%) would actually have COVID\\u201019 (false negative result). \\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \\nIn general, studies used relatively rigorous methods, particularly for selecting participants and performing the tests. Sometimes studies did not perform the test on the people for whom it was intended and did not follow the manufacturers\\u2019 instructions for using the test. Sometimes the tests were not carried out at the point of care. Studies used less rigorous methods for confirming the presence or absence of COVID\\u201019 infection; 91% of studies relied on a single negative RT\\u2010PCR result as evidence of no COVID\\u201019 infection. Results from different test brands varied, and relatively few studies directly compared one test brand with another. Finally, not all studies gave enough information about their participants for us to judge how long they had had symptoms, or even whether or not they had symptoms. \\nWhat does this mean? \\nIn people with symptoms, some rapid antigen tests are accurate enough to replace RT\\u2010PCR, especially for ruling in the presence of infection. Alternatively, where RT\\u2010PCR is available, rapid antigen tests could be used to select which people with symptoms require further testing with RT\\u2010PCR, thereby reducing the burden on laboratory services. This would be most useful when quick decisions are needed about patient care, to identify outbreaks, to allow people to self\\u2010isolate more quickly, or to initiate contact tracing. Rapid antigen tests are less good at ruling out infection in symptomatic people \\u2010 individuals who receive a negative rapid antigen test result may still be infected. \\nRapid antigen tests are less accurate when used in people with no symptoms of COVID\\u201019. More evidence is needed to understand the accuracy of rapid testing in people without symptoms and the extent to which repeated testing strategies can lead to reduced transmission, either for tests carried out at home or in non\\u2010healthcare settings such as schools. There is no independent evidence to support the use of many test brands. More direct comparisons of test brands are needed, with testers following manufacturers\\u2019 instructions. \\nHow up\\u2010to\\u2010date is this review? \\nThis review updates our previous review and includes evidence published up to 8 March 2021. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"simplified_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Plain Title\\nDo fertility drugs raise the risk of ovarian cancer?\\n\\nRationale\\n- Some drugs help women ovulate to treat trouble getting pregnant.  \\n- People worry these drugs could raise cancer risk.  \\n- Infertility itself can raise the risk of ovarian cancer.  \\n- This review looks at many studies to see if drugs add risk.\\n\\nTrial Design\\n- This is a systematic review of published studies.  \\n- It looks at women treated for infertility with fertility drugs, and compares them to others.  \\n- The total number of women studied is about 4.7 million in 37 studies.  \\n- Follow-up times varied. Newer studies have longer follow-up and more detail on dose and cycles.\\n\\nResults\\n- Overall, 37 studies with about 4.7 million women did not show strong ovarian cancer risk.  \\n- In 12 US case studies, risk rose, especially in women who had no children.  \\n- One study found more serous borderline tumors after cycles of progesterone, but cases were few.  \\n- Some studies link clomiphene to more borderline tumors in infertile women.  \\n- Infertility itself is a risk factor for ovarian cancer. Results must be read with care because many studies were small or flawed.\",\n          \"Plain Title\\nAre blood thinners good for small blood clots in the lungs?\\n\\nRationale\\nA pulmonary embolism (PE) is a dangerous blood clot in the lungs. It can block blood flow and is a major cause of death. Modern scans find more and more small clots in the outer parts of the lungs. Some clots are found by chance when a scan is done for another reason; this is called incidental SSPE. These small or incidental clots can cause few symptoms, but it is not clear what the best treatment is.\\n\\nDoctors use blood thinners, also called anticoagulants, to prevent more clots. But for small or incidentally found clots, we need to know if this treatment helps and if it is safe. The idea is that thinning the blood might stop more clots and help symptoms, but it could also raise the risk of bleeding. This study looked for solid evidence from good trials to answer these questions. The question was: do blood thinners work well and are they safe for people with SSPE or incidental SSPE?\\n\\nTrial Design\\nThis work is a review of past studies. The researchers searched for randomized trials. In a randomized trial, people are placed into two groups by chance. One group would get the blood thinner, the other would not, or would get a different treatment. The goal was to learn about safety and whether symptoms improve.\\n\\nThe study looked for adults with SSPE or incidental SSPE. It did not restrict by sex. The plan was to report what happened to people in the trials, and how long they stayed in the study. However, in this review, no eligible trials were found. Because of this, there were no people to follow and no study time to report. The search covered research available up to November 26, 2019.\\n\\nResults\\nThe main finding is simple: there are no randomized trials that test whether blood thinners help people with isolated SSPE or incidental SSPE. Because no trials met the criteria, we cannot say if the medicine helps or if it is safe in this situation.\\n\\nThis means there is no solid evidence to guide doctors or patients. Without good trials, we cannot make strong conclusions or recommendations. More careful, high\\u2011quality research is needed. If new studies are done, they should clearly compare blood thinners with not using them and report safe use and any benefits. Only then can doctors decide the best care for people with these small or incidental lung clots.\",\n          \"Plain Title\\nAre fast COVID tests good at finding infection?\\n\\nRationale\\nCOVID-19 is a lung illness that can spread easily. It can make people sick and keep them from work or school. Quick tests are useful because they can give results right away and help people isolate sooner. These tests are called rapid antigen tests. They look for a protein from the virus in a swab taken from the nose or throat. They are cheaper and easier to use than lab tests, and you can do them outside of a hospital.\\n\\nResearchers wanted to know how well these quick tests work. Do they correctly tell who is infected? Does the test work better for people with symptoms than for those with no symptoms? The hope is to guide using these tests in clinics, at home, or other places so people can act fast and stop the virus from spreading.\\n\\nTrial Design\\nThis work is a careful review of many studies, not one single trial. The researchers looked at studies that tested people with rapid antigen tests and also used a laboratory test called RT-PCR to confirm if someone really had the virus. They included tests done in hospitals, in the community, and at home. They looked at people with symptoms and people without symptoms.\\n\\nThe review covered a lot of ground. It included many different tests from many makers. It also included people of different ages and both sexes. In most studies, people only took one test and waited a short time for the result, since these tests give answers while you wait. The evidence in the review was collected up to early March 2021.\\n\\nResults\\nWhat did the researchers find about accuracy?\\n\\n- For people who truly have COVID-19 and show symptoms, the rapid test found the infection in about 7 out of 10 people. It missed the infection in about 3 out of 10 people with symptoms.\\n\\n- For people who have COVID-19 but have no symptoms, the test picked up the infection in about 5 out of 10 people. It missed about half of the infections.\\n\\n- The first week after symptoms begin is the best time to use the test. In that period, the test found infection in about 8 out of 10 people with symptoms.\\n\\n- For people who do not have symptoms but were around someone with COVID-19, the test found about 6 out of 10 infections.\\n\\n- When the person does not have COVID-19, the test correctly says \\u201cnot infected\\u201d most of the time. About 996 to 997 out of 1,000 people who do not have the virus test negative.\\n\\n- Results varied by which brand of test was used. Some tests met the World Health Organization\\u2019s acceptable standards for people with symptoms. A few tests met the standard in one study each. No test met the standard for people without symptoms.\\n\\n- In a large group of 10,000 people with no symptoms and no known exposure, about 50 people really had COVID. Of those 50, about 62 would test positive, but about 30 of those positives would be false positives. Among the 9,938 people who did not have COVID, about 18 would be false negatives.\\n\\nWhat this means for patients and care\\n- In people with symptoms, some rapid tests can be used to help confirm infection and decide if more tests are needed. They may help speed up care, stop spread, and guide actions like self\\u2011isolation and starting treatment.\\n- A negative rapid test in someone with symptoms does not completely rule out infection. A person can still have COVID-19 and may need a follow\\u2011up test, especially if symptoms remain.\\n- In people who have no symptoms, these tests are less reliable. They miss more infections and can give more false alarms. More evidence is needed to know how best to use them in schools, homes, or other non\\u2011healthcare settings.\\n- Results can vary by test brand, and not all brands have enough evidence to show how well they work. It is helpful to follow local guidelines and consider confirmatory lab testing when needed.\\n\\nConclusions from the researchers\\nRapid antigen tests can be helpful for people with symptoms to find infection quickly and may reduce the burden on lab testing. They work best in the first days after symptoms start. They are less accurate for people without symptoms. More studies are needed to compare different test brands directly and to see how repeated testing might improve accuracy, especially in people without symptoms.\\n\\nNotes for readers\\n- RT-PCR is a lab test that looks for the virus\\u2019s genetic material and is usually more accurate, but it takes longer.\\n- A rapid antigen test gives results in minutes, but its accuracy depends on symptoms, timing, and the brand of test used.\\n- Always follow health guidelines and talk with a health care provider if you have exposure or symptoms and get a test result that does not match how you feel.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertscore\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.017630563943562907,\n        \"min\": 0.7953708171844482,\n        \"max\": 0.8343802094459534,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8343802094459534,\n          0.8017697334289551,\n          0.7953708171844482\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"alignscore\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.19516743735170503,\n        \"min\": 0.31245750188827515,\n        \"max\": 0.856458306312561,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.856458306312561,\n          0.31245750188827515,\n          0.6005575656890869\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"flesch_kincaid_grade\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.517879449884282,\n        \"min\": 6.766938097216453,\n        \"max\": 10.577824737945491,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          7.479706959706963,\n          6.766938097216453,\n          7.215536136479535\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"coleman_liau_index\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.0270836591998702,\n        \"min\": 8.601927710843373,\n        \"max\": 11.10146750524109,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          9.826373626373627,\n          8.601927710843373,\n          8.63636363636364\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"flesch_reading_ease\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 8.1573817474903,\n        \"min\": 53.20842264150946,\n        \"max\": 72.03530120481929,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          59.44584859584862,\n          72.03530120481929,\n          70.68593551527515\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"gunning_fog_index\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.5814794203262788,\n        \"min\": 8.220268620268621,\n        \"max\": 12.076444444444444,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          8.220268620268621,\n          8.230162027420025,\n          9.534059617078485\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"smog_index\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.1267553773248966,\n        \"min\": 8.998388855275966,\n        \"max\": 11.830495888017047,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          8.998388855275966,\n          9.223106411051027,\n          9.833631430168197\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"dale_chall_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.9358277385950803,\n        \"min\": 8.683787079351891,\n        \"max\": 10.991912210012211,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          10.991912210012211,\n          8.683787079351891,\n          9.053809387603728\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
