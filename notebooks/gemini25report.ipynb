The severity of the cleft (opening) varies and it can occur on one (unilateral) or both sides (bilateral). It can be difficult to feed babies enough nutritious food when they have this condition, and there is evidence of delayed development in children born with cleft. \\nThis review aimed to compare the effects of different feeding interventions such as maternal advice and support, modified bottles and/or teats, obturating or maxillary plates (plates placed in the roof of the mouth to artificially close the cleft palate) and supplemental breastfeeding in babies with cleft lip and/or palate prior to, or following, closure. Interventions in the first 6 months from term and used with breast milk or formula feeding only were considered, but outcomes (measures of growth, development and parental satisfaction) may have been measured at any time including adulthood. \\nMaternal advice and support on feeding techniques and breastfeeding positions are often provided, but no studies evaluated the effectiveness of this intervention. Squeezable rather than rigid bottles may be easier to use for feeding babies with cleft lip and/or palate, and breastfeeding may have growth advantages over spoon‐feeding following cleft lip surgery. Only five studies (including 292 babies) compared the effects of feeding interventions in babies with cleft lip and/or palate on growth, development or parental satisfaction. Evidence for breastfeeding rather than spoon‐feeding following surgery was weak and there was a suggestion that squeezable bottles may be more manageable than rigid ones. No evidence was found to support the use of maxillary plates in babies with unilateral clefts and no studies assessed the effects of maternal advice or support. Further research is required to assess the most effective feeding interventions to prevent developmental delays in infants with cleft lip and/or palate. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD010497.pub2': \"Oral fumaric acid esters for the treatment of psoriasis\\nBackground \\nPsoriasis is a long‐term inflammatory skin condition that can markedly reduce the quality of life of affected individuals. Treatments taken by mouth (oral treatments), such as methotrexate, ciclosporin, and acitretin, are commonly prescribed to people with moderate to severe psoriasis. Oral fumaric acid esters (FAE) are licensed for the treatment of psoriasis in Germany but remain unlicensed in most other countries. This means that there are different treatment options offered to people in different countries. \\nReview question \\nWhat is the available evidence for the benefits and risks of using FAE for treating psoriasis? \\nStudy characteristics \\nOur review included six randomised control trials (RCTs) that involved 544 participants. Five RCTs compared FAE with placebo, and one compared FAE with methotrexate. The outcomes we were interested in measuring were the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), which is a psoriasis severity score, and the proportion of participants who discontinued treatment because of adverse (side) effects that are common but sufficiently serious that the drug had to be stopped, such as severe diarrhoea, infections, or cutaneous malignancy. \\nKey results \\nIt was difficult to pool and compare results because outcome measures differed between the studies. Three studies reported significant benefit with FAE when compared with placebo after 12 to 16 weeks of treatment, but we could not combine these results in a statistical analysis to show the overall difference. The included studies did not fully examine the chance of discontinuing FAE treatment because of adverse effects, which is uncertain. One study showed that individuals on FAE are nearly five times more likely to develop nuisance adverse effects; the most common were diarrhoea and abdominal cramps, flushing, reversible protein loss in the urine, and raised levels of eosinophil blood cells. Two RCTs were similar enough to allow the combination of their results and found that FAE were better than placebo when measured by the proportion of individuals who experienced at least a 50% improvement in their psoriasis severity score. One study reported improvement of individuals' quality of life with FAE in comparison with placebo, but the significance of this difference could not be calculated. The benefit of FAE was similar to methotrexate after 12 weeks when changes in disease severity from the start to the end of the trial were compared. The number of individuals experiencing nuisance adverse effects with these two treatments was not significantly different. The included studies, which were too small and of limited duration to provide evidence about rare or delayed effects, reported no serious adverse effects of FAE. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nThe risk of study bias, which means any factors that may systematically deviate away from the true findings, was unclear in most studies. This may be because most of the studies were conducted decades ago or were incompletely reported. Several analyses comparing FAE with placebo and methotrexate were limited because the studies were small or did not provide enough information to establish how these treatments compare with each other. Therefore, the overall quality of the evidence was low when comparing FAE with placebo and very low when comparing FAE with methotrexate. \\nFuture RCTs should use standard psoriasis outcome measures, including a validated quality of life scale, to enable the comparison and combination of results. They should be longer in duration or have longer follow‐up phases to provide evidence about any delayed adverse effects. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD002948.pub2': 'Herbal therapy for rheumatoid arthritis\\nThis summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effects of herbal therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). \\nThe review shows that in people with RA:\\n‐\\xa0Evening primrose oil, borage seed oil, or blackcurrent seed oil (containing gamma‐linolenic acid (GLA)) probably improve pain; may improve function; and probably does not increase adverse events (unwanted side effects). \\n‐ Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F may improve some symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, and higher doses (180 mg ‐ 350 mg daily) may be more effective than lower doses (60 mg daily). There are some adverse events associated with Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F. \\n‐\\xa0We are uncertain of the effects of other herbal therapies because only single studies were available, or important features of RA, such as changes in the number of swollen and tender joints, were not reported. \\nOften we do not have precise information about side effects and complications, particularly for rare but serious side effects.\\xa0Possible side effects associated with Triperygium wilfordii Hook F may include painful periods in women, decreased fertility in men, insufficient urine excretion, and increased rate of infections. Possible side effects associated with GLA sourced from evening primrose oil include headache, nausea, and diarrhoea, and rare complications include allergy and seizures. \\nWhat is rheumatoid arthritis and what is herbal therapy? \\nWhen you have RA, your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the lining of your joints. This makes your joints swollen, stiff and painful. The small joints of your hands and feet are usually affected first. There is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis at present, so treatments are used to relieve pain and stiffness and improve your ability to move. \\nHerbal interventions are defined as any plant preparation (whole, powder, extract, standardised mixture) used for medicinal purposes. Historically, many herbal therapies have been used to treat RA. Like conventional non‐herbal drugs, many herbal therapies are believed to act by blocking the activity of these immune cells and substances and reducing inflammation in the joints, and some people believe they have fewer side effects.\\xa0 \\nBest estimate of what happens to people with rheumatoid arthritis:\\xa0 \\nPain (higher scores mean worse or more severe pain):\\n‐People who took eveing primrose oil, primrose oil, borage seed oil, or blackcurrent seed oil (wih the active ingredient GLA) rated their pain to be 33 points lower (9 to 56 points lower) on a scale of 0 to 100 after 6 months of treatment (33% absolute improvement). \\n‐People who took placebo rated their pain to be 19 points lower after treatment.\\nPhysical function (higher score means greater disability):\\n‐People who took GLA rated their disability 16% better.\\n‐People who placebo rated their disability 5% better.\\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD000371.pub7': \"Deworming school children in low‐ and middle‐income countries\\nCochrane researchers examined the effects of deworming children in areas where intestinal worm infection is common. After searching for relevant trials up to 19 September 2018, we included 50 trials with a total of 84,336 participants, and an additional trial of one million children. \\nWhat is deworming and why might it be important \\nSoil‐transmitted worms, including roundworms, hookworms, and whipworms, are common in tropical and subtropical areas, and particularly affect children living in poverty where there is inadequate sanitation. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends that school children in many areas are regularly treated with drugs which kill these worms. Some advocates claim such programmes improve child growth, haemoglobin, cognition, school attendance, school performance, physical fitness, and survival. \\nWhat the research says \\nIn populations of children living in endemic areas, the effect of the first, single dose of deworming drugs on weight is unclear. There was little or no effect in most studies, except for a large effect detected from one study area in Kenya, reported in two trials carried out over 30 years ago in a school where children were heavily infected with worms. This causes uncertainty, which means we do not know if a first dose or single dose of deworming impacts on weight. For height, most studies showed little or no effect, with the exception of the site in Kenya. A single dose of deworming medicine probably has no effect on haemoglobin and cognition. There is insufficient data to know if there is an effect on school attendance, school performance, or physical fitness or mortality. \\nIn studies where children were regularly treated with deworming medicine there was little or no effect on weight in all but two trials, irrespective of whether children were heavily infected with worms or not. The two trials with large average weight gains included the Kenya study carried out over 30 years ago, and one study from India carried out over 20 years ago in a low worm burden area where later studies in the same area did not show an effect. In trials from 2000 onwards, which are more relevant given the global reduction in worm burden, there is little or no effect. This causes uncertainty and means we do not know if regularly treating children with deworming medicine improves their weight. Regularly deworming children probably has no effect on height, haemoglobin, cognition, and mortality. We do not know if there is an impact on school attendance, since the evidence is inconsistent and at high risk of bias. There is insufficient data to know if there is an effect on physical fitness. \\nAuthors' conclusions \\nFor public health programmes to regularly treat all children in endemic areas with deworming drugs, there is quite substantial evidence of no benefit in terms of haemoglobin, cognition, school performance, and mortality. For weight, contemporary studies do not show an effect, but unusually large effects were seen in studies over 20 years ago. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD005974.pub5': \"Are oral homeopathic medicinal products effective and safe to prevent and treat acute respiratory tract infections in children? \\nReview question \\nWe investigated whether oral homeopathic medicinal products are effective and safe to prevent or treat acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in children compared with an inactive (placebo) treatment or other medicines. \\nBackground \\nMost respiratory infections resolve without treatment, but sometimes symptoms persist after the initial infection has gone. Treatment is therefore aimed at relieving symptoms. Respiratory infections are commonly caused by viruses, especially colds and flu, though some lung and ear infections are caused by bacteria. It may be difficult to distinguish between viral and bacterial infections, and they may coexist. Antibiotics are often prescribed for respiratory infections even though they are ineffective against viruses. \\nChildren have on average three to six respiratory tract infections annually. Although most are mild and treatable, they sometimes require hospital treatment, and very rarely result in death. \\nHomeopathy may treat respiratory infections with few side effects, but its effectiveness and safety has not been well researched. \\nWe assessed evidence from randomised controlled trials (studies that allocate people by chance to receive treatment), which is the best way to assess the safety and efficacy of medical treatments. \\nSearch date \\nOur evidence is current to 27 November 2017.\\nStudy characteristics \\nWe included eight studies involving 1562 children that compared oral homeopathic treatment to either placebo or standard treatment to prevent or treat respiratory infections in children. All studies investigated upper respiratory tract (from the nose to the windpipe (trachea)) infections, but one combined reporting of upper and lower respiratory tract (from the windpipe to the lungs and pleura (membranes covering the lungs)) infections, so the numbers of children with upper or lower infections is unknown. \\nStudy funding sources \\nThree studies received funding from homeopathy manufacturers; one reported support from a non‐government organisation; two received government support; one was cosponsored by a university; and one did not report funding support. \\nKey results \\nStudies investigated a range of interventions for various illnesses and populations using different outcome measures, so only a small number could be combined for analysis. All moderate‐quality studies (low risk of bias) showed little or no beneficial effects for homeopathic medicinal products, whether individualised by a trained homeopath or a standard, non‐individualised commercially available therapy. Where results could be combined, there was probably little or no difference in benefit on short‐ or long‐term cure, or in prevention of ARTI. \\nTwo low‐quality studies (unclear or high risk of bias) showed some benefit of homeopathic medicinal products for a limited number of outcomes. One study showed a reduction in disease severity for the homeopathy group at some time points. The other study showed a reduction in number of respiratory infections over the following year in the treatment groups, although more than a quarter of participants were not accounted for in the results. There was no difference between homeopathy and placebo groups for parents' time off work, antibiotic use, or adverse effects. Consequently, there is no convincing evidence homeopathic medicinal products are effective in treating ARTIs in children. We are unsure about safety because data on adverse events were poorly reported. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nWe rated evidence as moderate or low quality for most outcomes. Three outcomes provided very low‐quality evidence because study populations and results differed significantly among studies; there were significant limitations in study design and reporting; and sample sizes were small. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD009487.pub3': 'Lateral pararectal versus transrectal stoma placement for prevention of parastomal herniation \\nWe asked \\nIs there a difference in the rate of parastomal herniation, and other stoma‐related complications in people undergoing abdominal wall enterostomy, when comparing two stoma formation techniques: lateral pararectal, in which the stoma is located beside the rectus abdominis muscle, one of the muscles of the abdominal wall, versus transrectal, in which the stoma is pulled through the rectus abdominis muscle? \\nBackground \\nA stoma is an opening in the abdomen, which is surgically created to divert the flow of urine or feces; an enterostomy is a stoma that starts in the bowel. A parastomal hernia is an incisional hernia, through which abdominal contents protrude through a defect in the abdominal wall at the site of previous surgery. It is related to a stoma, and is one of the most common stoma‐related complications. Many factors that potentially influence the occurrence of parastomal herniation have been investigated. However, it remains unclear whether the enterostomy should be placed through or beside the rectus abdominis muscle in order to prevent parastomal herniation. \\nStudy characteristics \\nThe evidence is current to 9 November 2018. In this update, we included 10 retrospective cohort studies with a total of 864 participants, and one randomized controlled trial (RCT: a study in which participants are randomly allocated to the treatment groups), including 60 participants. The target population was individuals, regardless of age, who received a temporary or permanent enterostomy for any reason in either the elective (planned) or the emergency setting. \\nKey results \\nThe results found inconclusive results between the two techniques for the risk of parastomal herniation (11 studies, 924 participants), stomal prolapse (1 study, 145 participants), ileus or stenosis (1 study, 60 participants), and skin irritation (1 study, 60 participants). \\nNeither technique was found to be better than the other for any of the stoma‐related outcomes of interest. \\nNone of the studies measured other stoma‐related problems, or death.\\nQuality of the evidence \\nWe downgraded the quality of the evidence to moderate, low, or very low, because of high risk of bias, small sample sizes, few events, and diversity across studies. \\nConclusion \\nBased on the current knowledge presented in this review, there is no evidence to support the use of one stoma formation technique over the other. Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD004957.pub3': 'Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes following joint replacement at the hip and knee in chronic arthropathy \\nJoint replacements are common procedures and treatment of choice for those with intractable joint pain and disability arising from arthropathy of the hip or knee. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation is considered integral to the outcome of joint replacement. \\nFive trials (619 participants) met the inclusion criteria; two addressed inpatient rehabilitation (261 participants) and three (358 participants) home‐based settings. There were no trials addressing outpatient centre‐based programmes. Pooling of data was not possible due to differences in study design and outcomes used. Methodological assessment showed all trials were of low quality. For inpatient settings early commencement of rehabilitation and clinical pathways led to more rapid attainment of functional milestones (disability) (Functional Independence Measure (FIM) transfer WMD 0.5, 95% CI 0.15, 0.85, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 6, FIM ambulation WMD 1.55 (95%CI 0.96, 2.14), NNTB = 3), shorter hospital stay, fewer post‐operative complications and reduced costs in the first three to four months. Home‐based multidisciplinary care improved functional gain (Oxford Hip Score (OHS) WMD at 6 months ‐7.00 (95%CI ‐10.36, ‐3.64), NNT = 2 and quality of life (QoL) and reduced hospital stay in the medium term (six months). No trials addressed longer‐term outcomes following hip replacement only. \\nBased on the heterogeneity and the low quality of the included trials that precluded pooled meta‐analysis, there is silver level evidence that following hip or knee joint replacement, early multidisciplinary rehabilitation can improve outcomes at the level of activity and participation. The optimal intensity, frequency and effects of rehabilitation over a longer period and associated social costs need further study. Future research should focus on improving methodological and scientific rigour of clinical trials, and use of standardised outcome measures, so that results can be pooled for statistical analysis. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD009134.pub2': \"Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for acute respiratory failure following upper abdominal surgery \\nReview question \\nThe goal of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) (continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel NPPV) compared with oxygen therapy alone in adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. \\nBackground \\nAcute respiratory failure , where fluid builds up in the lungs stopping oxygen from crossing into the blood, is a relatively common complication after abdominal surgery and can increase the risk of dying (mortality). \\nNPPV is a type of treatment that helps to improve breathing without having to insert a tube inside a person's windpipe (tracheal intubation). This intervention is effective in several illnesses. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe searched scientific databases for clinical trials looking at the treatment of adults with acute respiratory failure following abdominal surgery. The trials compared NPPV with usual care(oxygen therapy through a face mask). We included two trials involving 269 participants.The participants were mostly men (67%) and on average 65 years of age. One trial was conducted in several intensive care units (ICU). Both trials included adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. The evidence is current to May 2015. \\nKey results \\nThis review examined mortality, rate of tracheal intubation, length of stay in the ICU, length of hospital stay, complications after NPPV, and changes in the levels of gases within the blood (arterial blood gases). \\nCompared with oxygen therapy, NPPV decreased the rate of tracheal intubation. Out of every 1000 adults who developed acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery, 181 adults treated with oxygen therapy would need to be intubated compared with 54 adults treated with NPPV. \\nWhen compared to oxygen therapy, NPPV tended to reduce mortality. However, since the number of participants included in the two trials was small, more studies are needed. \\nThe use of NPPV also reduced the length of stay in the ICU by almost two days when compared to oxygen therapy. However, the mean length of stay in the hospital was similar in the two groups. \\nWhen compared to oxygen therapy, NPPV improved blood gas levels one hour after the intervention. \\nThere was insufficient evidence to be certain that CPAP or NPPV had an effect on anastomotic (e.g. where two pieces of intestine are joined together) leakage, pneumonia related complications and sepsis (blood poisoning) or infections. However, adults treated with NPPV had lower rates these complications than adults treated with oxygen. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nThere was low quality evidence for hospital mortality, low quality of evidence for rate of tracheal intubation, and very low quality of evidence for ICU length of stay. \\nAuthors' conclusions \\nThe findings of this review showed that NPPV is an effective and safe treatment for adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. However, due to the low quality of the evidence, more good quality studies are needed to confirm these findings. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD008844.pub2': 'Granulocyte colony stimulating factor treatment following a heart attack\\nPeople who suffer a heart attack (due to a blockage in the artery supplying blood to the heart) are usually affected by the damage to a portion of their heart muscle. Current treatment options are unable to restore the damaged section of the heart. Recently, stem cells have been shown to be able to restore and replace the damaged tissue in patients with heart attack. These cells could be mobilized to the heart with agents such as granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G‐CSF). \\nIn this review, analysis of seven included studies with low risk of bias using G‐CSF to improve the function of damaged heart of patient with heart attack failed to show any beneficial effects of this treatment. The rate of mortality was not different between the two groups (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.80, P = 0.55). Also, left ventricular parameters including left ventricular ejection fraction (RR 3.41, 95% CI ‐0.61 to 7.44, P = 0.1), end systolic volume (RR ‐1.35, 95% CI ‐4.68 to 1.99, P = 0.43) and end diastolic volume (RR ‐4.08, 95% CI ‐8.28 to 0.12, P = 0.06) did not show significant changes between the treatment and the control groups. There was no evidence that the study was associated with serious adverse effects, however it should be noted that the study was limited since the trials included lacked long enough follow up durations. Additionally four studies had either high or unclear risk of bias for blinding. Therefore, based on the results of the current study, G‐CSF treatment should not be administered for patients with heart attack. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD009058.pub3': \"Cryotherapy for liver metastases\\nReview question \\nIs cryotherapy (cooling) beneficial or harmful for local destruction of cancer (tumours) spread to the liver? \\nBackground \\nWhen cancer spreads in the body (metastasis), one of the most common sites is the liver. Besides cancers of the liver (primary liver cancer), liver metastases from colorectal cancer are the most common cancer affecting the liver. More than half of people who have cancer spread to the liver die from complications. Cryotherapy is one of methods, used to destroy metastases in the liver. This method requires placing a special probe near the cancer site. The probe is used to deliver extreme cold to the site, which is produced by liquid nitrogen or argon gas. Placement of the probe can be guided using ultrasound or computed tomography (a special x‐ray). The rapid freezing process kills the cancer cells, and the size of the cancer is reduced. However, it is not clear if this treatment prolongs life or increases quality of life of affected people. \\nWe reviewed the evidence about the effect of cryotherapy in destroying cancer metastases in the liver. We searched for studies assessing the effect of cryotherapy in comparison with no treatment or any other treatment in people with liver metastases from cancer of any location. We aimed to assess the effect of cryotherapy on the risk of death, quality of life, and adverse events (side effects caused by the treatment). \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe last searched for evidence in June 2018. We included only one trial conducted in Ukraine, and participants' primary cancer was colorectal (bowel) cancer in 66% of instances, but there were also people with stomach, breast, skin, and other tumours. All of them had cancer spread to the liver. In this trial, 123 participants were allocated at random to receive either cryotherapy (63 people) or conventional surgery (affected parts of the liver were removed; 60 people). \\nFunding \\nThe trial did not provide information on funding.\\nKey results \\nThe trial was at high risk of bias. The participants were followed for up to 10 years (minimum five months). The trial reported that the mortality at 10 years was 81% (51/63) in the cryotherapy group and 92% (55/60) in the conventional surgery group. We judged the evidence as low‐certainty evidence. We found no evidence of a difference in proportion of participants with recurrence of the malignancy in the liver: 86% (54/63) of the participants in the cryotherapy group and 95% (57/60) of the participants in the conventional surgery group developed a new malignancy (low‐certainty evidence). The frequency of reported complications was similar between the cryotherapy group and the conventional surgery group, except for postoperative pain. Both insignificant and pronounced pain were reported to be more common in the cryotherapy group while intense pain was reported to be more common in the conventional surgery group. However, it was not reported whether there was any evidence of a difference. The frequency of unwanted effects (adverse events or complications) was mostly similar in both groups, but pain intensity and frequency seemed to differ between the groups. There were no intervention‐related mortality or bile leakages. The trial did not provide data on quality of life; cancer mortality, and time to progression of liver metastases. \\nReliability of the evidence \\nThe evidence for the effectiveness of cryotherapy versus conventional surgery in people with liver metastases is of low certainty. We are uncertain about our estimate and cannot determine whether cryotherapy compared with conventional surgery is beneficial or harmful. We found no evidence for the benefits or harms of cryotherapy compared with no intervention, or versus systemic treatments. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD006237.pub4': \"What are the best ways to help people with depression go back to work?\\nWhat is depression? \\nDepression is a common mental health problem that can cause a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest in people, activities, and things that were once enjoyable. A person with depression may feel tearful, irritable, or tired most of the time, and may have problems with sleep, concentration, and memory. \\nDepression may affect people's ability to work. People with depression may be absent from work (off sick), or feel less able to cope with working. \\nGoing back to work \\nReducing depressive symptoms may help people with depression to go back to work. Treatments include medications and psychological (talking) therapies, or a combination of both. Changes at the workplace could also help, such as: \\nchanging a person's tasks or working hours;\\nsupporting them in a gradual return to work; or\\nhelping them to cope better with certain work situations.\\nWhy we did this Cochrane Review \\nWork can improve a person's physical and mental well‑being; it helps build confidence and self‐esteem, allows people to socialise, and provides money. We wanted to find out if workplace changes and clinical programmes could help people with depression to return to work. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched for studies that looked at whether workplace changes and clinical programmes affected the amount of sick leave taken by people with depression. Clinical programmes included: medicines (anti‐depressants); psychological therapies; improved healthcare by doctors; and other programmes such as exercise and diet.\\xa0 \\nSearch date: we included evidence published up to 4 April 2020. \\nWhat we found \\nWe found 45 studies in 12,109 people with depression. The studies took place in Europe (34\\xa0studies), the USA (8), Australia (2) and Canada (1). \\nThe effects of 'care as usual' were compared with those of workplace changes and clinical programmes to find out: \\nhow many days people with depression were on sick leave\\nhow many people with depression were off work;\\npeople's symptoms of depression; and\\nhow well people with depression could cope with their work.\\nWhat are the results of our review? \\nOur main findings within the first year of follow‐up, for workplace changes or treatments compared with usual care, are listed below. \\nWorkplace changes combined with a clinical programme:\\nprobably reduce the number of days on sick leave (on average, by 25 days for each person over one year; 9 studies; 1292\\xa0participants); \\ndo not reduce the number of people off work (2 studies; 1025\\xa0participants);\\nmay reduce symptoms of depression (8 studies; 1091 participants); and\\nmay improve ability to cope with work (5 studies; 926 participants).\\nWorkplace changes alone:\\nmay increase the number of days on sick leave (2\\xa0studies, 130\\xa0participants);\\nprobably do not lead to more people off work (1 study; 226\\xa0participants);\\nprobably do not affect symptoms of depression (4 studies; 390 participants); and\\nmay not improve ability to cope with work (1 study; 48 participants).\\nImproved healthcare alone:\\nprobably reduces the number of days on sick leave, by 20 days (in two, well‐conducted studies in 692 participants, although not in all 7\\xa0studies, in 1912\\xa0participants); \\nprobably reduces symptoms of depression (7 studies; 1808 participants); and\\nmay reduce ability to cope with work (1 study; 604 participants).\\nPsychological therapies alone:\\nmay reduce the number of days off work, by 15 days (9 studies; 1649\\xa0participants); and \\nmay reduce symptoms of depression (8 studies; 1255 participants).\\nWe are uncertain if psychological therapies alone affect people's ability to cope with work (1\\xa0study; 58 participants). \\nHow reliable are these results? \\nOur confidence in these results is mostly moderate to low. Some findings are based on small numbers of studies, in small numbers of participants. We also found limitations in the ways some studies were designed, conducted and reported. \\nKey messages \\nCombining workplace changes with a clinical programme probably helps people with depression to return to work more quickly and to take fewer days off sick. We need more evidence to assess which combination of workplace changes and clinical programmes works best. \\nImproved healthcare probably also helps people with depression to take fewer days off sick. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD003737.pub4': 'What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for intermittent exotropia (an eye co‐ordination problem that starts in childhood)? \\nKey messages \\n· Covering one eye with a patch improves the eye co‐ordination of children with intermittent exotropia more effectively than regular monitoring by an eye specialist. \\n· Few studies have compared other treatments for intermittent exotropia, and those that have do not provide clear answers about their benefits and risks. \\n· Well‐conducted studies are needed in this area to improve the management of intermittent exotropia. \\nWhat is intermittent exotropia? \\nIntermittent exotropia is an eye condition that develops in the first year of life. It causes one or both eyes to turn out toward the ear, typically when a child looks into the distance, daydreams, is tired, or is in bright sunlight. Only one eye turns out at a time, while the other eye points straight forwards. This can happen infrequently, or regularly throughout the day. \\nWhat treatments are available for intermittent exotropia? \\nRegular monitoring (observation) by an eye specialist may be all that is needed when a child’s eyes point in the same direction most of the time, or when intermittent exotropia does not affect vision. \\nFor children with more severe intermittent exotropia, several treatments are available, including: \\n· eye exercises, to improve a child’s control over their eye movements;\\n· glasses, to encourage the eyes to work together;\\n· eye muscle surgery, to adjust the position of the eyes; and\\n· covering one eye with a patch, to strengthen the other eye.\\nWhat did we want to find out? \\nWe wanted to find out:\\n· which treatment works best for intermittent exotropia; and\\n· whether treatments cause any unwanted (adverse) effects.\\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched for studies that compared different treatments for intermittent exotropia against each other. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe found 6 studies that involved a total of 890 people who were mostly children aged 12 months to 10 years. The studies followed people for between six months and three years, and took place in the USA (four studies), India (one study), and Turkey (one study). The studies compared: \\n· patching against observation (two studies); and\\n· different treatments involving surgery (four studies).\\nPatching compared to observation \\nThe evidence:\\n· shows that patching is better than observation for improving eye co‐ordination; and \\n· suggests that patching and observation may have similar effects on sharpness of near vision. \\nDifferent surgical procedures \\nThe evidence suggests that:\\n· surgery on the muscles that control the outward movement of both eyes is probably better for improving eye co‐ordination than surgery on the muscles that control both inward and outward movement in one eye; \\n· these two procedures may have similar effects on sharpness of near vision and quality of life, and may lead to similar numbers of adverse effects (such as small lumps under the skin); and \\n· there may be little to no difference in effect on eye co‐ordination when looking at distant objects between surgical procedures on the inside of the eye (‘plication’ and ‘resection’) when combined with surgery on the outside of the eye. \\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \\nThe evidence is based on a small number of studies, and several studies may have used methods likely to introduce errors in their results. In general, the studies provided limited information about the benefits and risks of different treatments for intermittent exotropia. For example, they often did not investigate adverse effects or effects on sharpness of vision at a distance and quality of life. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this evidence? \\nThe evidence is current to January 2021.\\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD007263.pub3': \"Dilute versus full‐strength formula in exclusively formula‐fed preterm or low birth weight infants \\nReview questionIs dilute formula milk (e.g. half the strength at double the volume) better tolerated than full‐strength formula milk in the initial feeding of preterm babies for whom breast milk is not available?\\xa0 \\nBackgroundBabies born preterm (at less than 37 weeks'\\xa0gestation) or with a low birth weight (less than 2500 grams) have special feeding requirements. Expressed breast milk is preferred, but preterm babies are often fed with formula milk because breast milk is not always available. The provision of artificial feeds varies considerably in preterm babies and there is concern that introducing full‐strength formulas too early may lead to the retention of feed in the stomach, which is associated with feeding intolerance and necrotising enterocolitis, a severe bowel disorder. \\nStudy characteristicsThe evidence for this review is current as of 1 October 2018. We included three trials that compared dilute formula milk (half‐strength, double‐volume) with full‐strength formula milk. The trials involved 102 preterm or low birth weight infants; two were conducted in the USA and one in India. The trials were small (14, 38 and 50 infants, respectively) and conducted between 25 and 30 years ago. The quality of two trials was judged to be poor due to insufficient information being provided in the trial publications, but judged to be moderate in the third trial (of 38 infants). None of the trials assessed necrotising enterocolitis\\xa0as an outcome. \\nKey resultsInfants receiving dilute formula (half‐strength, double‐volume) experienced fewer episodes of feeding intolerance and achieved full energy intake earlier than infants receiving full‐strength formula (20 kcal/oz (~ 68 to 70 kcal/100 mL)). \\nFeeding intoleranceTwo measures of feeding intolerance (abdominal distension and episodes of gastric residuals) were reported across the trials. Two trials (88 infants) provided data for\\xa0abdominal distension and gastric residuals. Infants fed dilute formula experienced 19% (CI 16% to 23%) fewer episodes of abdominal distension (> 2 cm), equivalent to 0.67 episodes per infant in the half‐strength group compared to 0.83 episodes in the full‐strength group. It was not possible to combine data on gastric residuals but both trials reported fewer episodes of gastric residuals in the dilute formula group. The third trial (14 infants) only reported that there was no difference between the groups with respect to these two outcomes. \\nTime to establish full enteral feedingIn two trials (88 infants) infants receiving dilute formula experienced a 22% (CI 16% to 28%) reduction in the number of days required to reach an adequate energy intake (420 joules/kilogram), equivalent to 8 days in the half‐strength group compared to 10.3 days in the full‐strength group. \\nCertainty of evidenceIn exclusively formula‐fed preterm or low birth weight infants, low‐certainty evidence shows that diluted formula may lead\\xa0to an important reduction in the time taken to attain adequate enteral fluid and energy requirements, without increasing indicators of feeding intolerance. The clinical importance of the reduction in episodes of feeding intolerance\\xa0is unclear. These findings are based on three small, old trials that may be of less relevance to current\\xa0practice. A lack of data on other important outcomes, such as the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis and weight gain, limits the usefulness of the studies. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD006171.pub4': \"Prenatal education for congenital toxoplasmosis\\nToxoplasmosis infection is caused by a parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. Eating or handling raw or insufficiently‐cooked meat, not washing hands thoroughly after gardening, handling contaminated soil or water, or contact with cats' faeces can cause infection. Usually it is asymptomatic and self‐limiting. Primary prevention involves educating the general public, filtering water and improving farm hygiene to reduce animal infection. \\nIf pregnant women have not previously been exposed to the parasite and develop antibodies while pregnant, the infection can be transmitted from the mother to the fetus (congenital toxoplasmosis). This is rare but potentially has serious consequences such as malformation, mental retardation, deafness and blindness of the infected infant, intrauterine death or stillbirth. The probability of infection is greater during the third trimester but the risk of the fetus developing major clinical signs is greater early in pregnancy. Pregnant women are often unaware of risk factors for congenital toxoplasmosis. Offering prenatal education could mean that women adopt simple behavioral measures to avoid toxoplasmosis. \\nThis review included two randomized controlled trials (involving 5455 women). Data could not be combined because each trial measured effectiveness in different ways. One study was from Canada and involved 432 women randomly assigned to a 10‐minute presentation during a prenatal class about toxoplasmosis prevention or to a usual prenatal class. Losses to follow‐up were high and 285 completed the post‐test questionnaire in the third trimester. Only 5% of the intervention women recalled having obtained information on toxoplasmosis prevention during prenatal classes. However, the authors concluded that prenatal education can effectively change pregnant women's behavior as it increased pet, personal and food hygiene. The other trial conducted in France involved 5023 pregnant women with no evidence of toxoplasmosis infection (seronegative) who were randomly assigned to receive a brochure and an audiotape containing information for toxoplasmosis prevention, or to a usual prenatal class. Losses to follow‐up were high and 2790 completed both pre‐test and post‐test questionnaire on behavior (44.5% loss to follow‐up), whereas 3949 women were tested for blood antibodies (22.4% loss to follow‐up). Women's behavior did not change after the intervention. Similarly, the seroconversion rate did not differ between groups (13 out of 2591 women seroconverted in the intervention and four out of 1358 in the control group). \\nBoth trials were judged as having low methodological quality as assessed by the GRADE approach. This limits our confidence in the results. Evidence supporting prenatal education to prevent congenital toxoplasmosis is therefore limited. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD005231.pub3': \"Can smokers be helped to reduce the harm caused by cigarette smoking by smoking fewer cigarettes or using different tobacco products? \\nBackground \\nThe best thing to do to reduce the harms caused by smoking is to quit, but some people may not want to do this or may feel that they are unable to stop smoking completely. Cutting down the number of cigarettes smoked daily or using different tobacco products, such as chewing tobacco or low‐tar cigarettes, may reduce some of the harm caused by smoking. It may also help people to stop smoking completely in the long term. On the other hand, reducing smoking or using other tobacco products may not improve health and could reduce a person's motivation to quit smoking altogether. It is important that we review the evidence to find out whether these approaches could help smokers who do not want to or cannot quit to reduce the harm caused by their smoking. We were mainly interested in whether these approaches improved the health of smokers, but also looked at smoking reduction and quitting rates. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe found 20 randomised controlled trials that tested ways to help people to cut down the number of cigarettes they smoked. Some of these just advised smokers to smoke less, but most also provided them with a product to help them cut down: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline, bupropion, electronic cigarettes (ecigs), or snus (a form of smokeless, oral tobacco). We also found four randomized controlled trials that tested the effects of using cigarettes designed to reduce the damage caused by smoking: reduced tar, carbon or nicotine cigarettes. Most of the studies used NRT to help people to reduce their smoking. All of the studies included people who were not planning to quit smoking soon. The research is current to October 2015. \\nKey results \\nEight studies (with 3081 smokers) found that using NRT roughly doubled the likelihood of halving the number of cigarettes smoked each day, compared to using a placebo. Using NRT in this way also nearly doubled the likelihood of quitting completely. One trial each tested bupropion, varenicline, ecigs and snus to help reduce the harms caused by smoking, and there was no evidence that any of these treatments helped smokers to reduce the number of cigarettes they were smoking each day. This may be because there has not yet been enough research into these methods. Only one of the trials testing cigarettes designed to reduce risk measured their effect on the number of people quitting smoking. It found that people were not more likely to quit smoking if they used reduced‐nicotine cigarettes than if they smoked their usual cigarettes. We did not find any trials which reported the long‐term health effects of the treatments, and so it remains uncertain how much health benefit there is from reducing the number of cigarettes smoked each day or smoking cigarettes designed to be less harmful. \\nQuality of evidence \\nThe tobacco industry funded three of the included studies of cigarettes designed to reduce risk. None of the studies looked at whether there had been a long‐term change in the health of the users. We rate the quality of the evidence looking at how many people quit smoking as 'low' or 'very low', generally because the findings are based on a small number of studies. We need more studies to investigate methods of reducing the harm caused by continued smoking. These need to measure the health of the users over a long period. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD009868.pub3': 'Fixed‐dose combination drug therapy for the prevention of heart disease and stroke\\nReview question: We reviewed the evidence about the effect of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy on the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. We found 13 studies including 9059 participants. \\nBackground: We wanted to discover whether using fixed‐dose combination therapy was better or worse than other alternatives, such as usual care, placebo, or giving drugs separately, for the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. This report represents an update from a previous review published in 2014. \\nStudy characteristics: The evidence is current to September 2016. Four studies included individuals with a prior heart attack or stroke or with a high predicted risk for having an initial heart attack and five studies had long‐term (12 months or more) follow‐up. The main risk of bias was related to lack of blinding of participants and personnel, which was inherent to the intervention. Most study participants were middle‐aged men with moderate elevations in blood pressure or cholesterol. Two studies specifically included ethnic Aboriginal or Maori minorities in half of the study participants. The fixed‐dose combinations ranged from two to five drugs; all studies included at least one blood pressure‐lowering and one cholesterol‐lowering drug. \\nKey results: The effects of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy on all‐cause mortality and fatal and non‐fatal heart attacks and strokes are uncertain, primarily due to the low number of participants experiencing these events in these studies (fewer than 5% for both) and comparisons with usual care (low‐quality evidence). Fixed‐dose combination drug therapy leads to more adverse events than control (32% versus 27%), including placebo (moderate‐quality evidence). This information is not surprising since aspirin, blood pressure‐lowering drugs and cholesterol drugs are known to increase the risk for side effects compared with placebo. Fixed‐dose combination therapy may modestly lower blood pressure (˜6 mmHg) and cholesterol (‐0.6 mmol/L in LDL cholesterol), but these effects were not consistent (moderate‐quality evidence for blood pressure and LDL cholesterol but low‐quality evidence of total cholesterol). Fixed‐dose combination therapy appears to improve adherence to medications to prevent ASCVD (moderate‐quality evidence). \\nQuality of the evidence: The quality of evidence from these studies generally ranged from moderate to low.

The radial head is part of the elbow joint. Fracture or breaking of the radial head is the most common elbow fracture. This injury usually results from a fall onto an outstretched arm. The symptoms of a radial head fracture are pain, swelling and bruising around the elbow, as well as restricted movement. \\nWhat is aspiration? \\nOne treatment for radial head fracture is aspiration. This is a procedure where a sterile needle and syringe are used to drain excess fluid and blood from the elbow joint to relieve pressure and thus, in theory, relieve pain and improve clinical outcome. However, aspiration is an invasive procedure that puts the patient at further risk of complications, such as infection and injury to nerves and vessels. The procedure is typically done in the first few days after injury. \\nAim of the review \\nWe aimed to assess the effects (benefits and harms) of aspiration of the elbow joint for treating radial head fracture in adults. \\nDescription of the studies included in the review  We searched the medical literature up to April 2014 and found two relevant studies that reported results for a total of 108 people with radial head fractures. Most participants were adults, aged 30 or over. They generally had less serious fractures and were all treated without surgery. The two studies were small, poorly reported and at high risk of bias. Neither study used reliable measures to assess function or pain. Consequently, we are very unsure of the findings of these trials. \\nSummary of the evidence \\nVery low quality evidence showed little difference between those who had joint aspiration and those who did not in being unable to carry heavy loads or having discomfort when carrying loads using their previously injured arm at one year after injury. Very low quality evidence shows that aspiration often provides immediate pain relief and may still provide pain relief at three weeks. Neither trial reported on adverse events from the procedure, but aspiration was reported as being unsuccessful in three participants of one study. Very low quality evidence shows little effect of aspiration on being able to extend the elbow at either six weeks or one year. The reporting of adverse events was incomplete, but one trial reported the absence of three common complications of radial head fractures. \\nConclusions \\nOverall, there is not enough evidence to say whether aspiration gives better short‐term or longer‐term results than no aspiration in treating radial head fractures or how safe it is. We suggest that further research is needed to examine the use of aspiration for the initial treatment of radial head fractures. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD010299.pub2': 'Benefits of patient‐reported measures of health and well‐being versus traditional follow‐up after treatment of gynaecological cancer \\nBackground \\nCancer is a leading cause of death worldwide.\\xa0The traditional method of follow‐up involves multiple visits to the hospital to check, for example, whether the cancer has come back (recurrence). This may cause anxiety among the patients and its cost effectiveness is questionable. Clinician and patient groups have asked for a consideration of alternative model approaches; since most recurrences are symptomatic, follow‐up of patients after treatment for gynaecological cancer may be accomplished by patient‐related outcome measures (PROMs) rather than routine follow‐up visits. PROMs is an umbrella term that covers a range of potential types of measurements, but is used specifically to refer to self reports by the patient of their health and well‐being. Use of PROMs as alternatives to follow‐up may have immense psychological benefits for the patient and cost benefit to the healthcare system. There is currently no evidence to determine whether PROMs are better or worse in helping women to live longer and better after gynaecological cancer rather than follow‐up visits. It is also unclear whether PROMs are \\xa0beneficial in terms of patient satisfaction or quality of life. \\nStudy Characteristics \\nWe performed an extensive literature search to identify randomised controlled studies that compared PROMs to routine follow up. \\nKey findings \\nNo studies suitable for inclusion in our review were found. This highlights the need for good‐quality studies comparing PROMs to standard follow‐up.

This is known as a hyperextension injury. Characteristically, this occurs in sporting accidents, such as where a football strikes an outstretched hand. These injuries are common and typically affect people of working age. Usually, these patients are treated without surgery using a combination of support (splinting/strapping to the adjacent finger) and exercise advice. Use of the hand is commonly encouraged but restricted to some degree by the severity of the injury. By examining the evidence from randomised controlled trials, this review aimed to assess which treatment for hyperextension injuries of the proximal interphalangeal joints of the fingers results in the best outcome for patients. The outcomes examined included function (including return to work), pain and joint movement. \\nThree small studies including a total of 366 patients met the inclusion criteria for the review. The studies, which were all over 15 years old, were prone to bias. None of the studies reported any self assessment of function by participants. One study compared unrestricted mobility with immobilisation. One trial compared protected mobilisation (using a removable support in combination with exercise) with immobilisation. The remaining study compared immobilisation for one week versus three weeks. None of these trials found important differences between their intervention groups in various measures of poor outcome, pain and range of movement at six months follow‐up. \\nWe concluded that there was a lack of robust evidence to inform on the need for, and the extent and duration of, immobilisation for these injuries. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD008838.pub2': \"Immunotherapy for preventing allergic reactions to insect stings\\nAt least 1 in 200 people have suffered a severe allergic reaction to a sting from a bee, wasp, or ant, and insect stings are the second most common cause of fatal allergic reactions in some countries. Treatment with insect venom, usually given by a course of injections (called venom immunotherapy), is thought to reduce the risk of allergic reactions to an insect sting. In this review, we evaluated the effectiveness of venom immunotherapy for preventing allergic reactions to insect stings. \\nFrom analysis of 7 studies, which included 392 participants, we found that this treatment reduces the chance of having a serious allergic reaction to an insect sting by 90%, a consistent finding between studies. Venom immunotherapy also significantly improves the quality of life of people who have had a serious allergic reaction to an insect sting by reducing anxiety and possible limitation of activities caused by fear of insects. However, almost 1 in 10 people treated with venom immunotherapy during the trials had an allergic reaction to their treatment. We were unable to find out whether venom immunotherapy prevents fatal allergic reactions to insect stings, because these are so rare. The decision whether to start venom immunotherapy depends on an accurate diagnosis, followed by careful assessment of a person's risk of having another allergic reaction to a sting, the degree to which the insect sting allergy affects their quality of life, and the risk of an allergic reaction to their treatment. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD006682.pub6': \"Length of time needed for antibiotic treatment given directly into the blood stream to clear acute chest infections in people with cystic fibrosis \\nReview question \\nWe reviewed the evidence about how long intravenous antibiotic treatment (antibiotics given directly into the blood stream) is needed to clear flare ups of chest symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis. \\nBackground \\nFlare ups of symptoms (exacerbations) in people with cystic fibrosis are treated aggressively to prevent further damage to the lungs. This practice has led to better survival rates for people with cystic fibrosis in recent years. However, there are no clear guidelines on how long treatment with intravenous antibiotics should be to treat these flare ups. Different centres tend to use different treatment regimens.

A shorter duration of treatment may be better as these courses of treatment are easier for people to complete. They are also less expensive and cause fewer drug reactions than longer treatments.

Based on clinical features, psoriasis is generally divided into the following: chronic plaque psoriasis (CPP); psoriasis associated with psoriatic arthritis; and pustular, erythrodermic, or guttate psoriasis. We also considered psoriasis affecting the palms and soles (palmoplantar psoriasis, or PPP). Although psoriasis is rarely life‐threatening, it can affect a person's quality of life significantly. \\nPhototherapy is an essential treatment option for people with psoriasis. The most commonly used types of phototherapy are narrow‐band ultraviolet B (NB‐UVB), broad‐band ultraviolet B (BB‐UVB), and psoralen ultraviolet A photochemotherapy (PUVA). PUVA can be further divided into oral, bath, and topical PUVA according to the administrative route of psoralen. NB‐UVB delivers almost exclusively 311 nm radiation, whereas BB‐UVB can be divided into two types: selective BB‐UVB (305 to 325 nm radiation) and conventional BB‐UVB (280 to 320 nm radiation). \\nThis review included 13 small randomised controlled trials (RCT), with a total of 662 participants. Most of these were of poor methodological quality. \\nFor treating CPP, the clearance rate between the NB‐UVB and oral PUVA groups were inconsistent in three RCTs. In one, there was no difference between the groups, and in the other two, the clearance rate was in favour of oral PUVA. The evidence from the comparison of NB‐UVB with bath PUVA in terms of clearance rate was also inconsistent: Pooled data from two left‐right body comparison RCTs found no significant difference between the two groups, while another RCT favoured bath PUVA. \\nTwo RCTs found NB‐UVB plus retinoid (re‐NB‐UVB) and PUVA plus retinoid (re‐PUVA) had similar effects for treating people with CPP or guttate psoriasis. One RCT found no significant differences between NB‐UVB and selective BB‐UVB for clearing CPP or in the number of withdrawals due to side‐effects. \\nIn participants with PPP, one RCT found there were no statistically significant differences between NB‐UVB treated sides and topical PUVA treated sides in terms of clearance rate. \\nIn summary, NB‐UVB may be preferred to oral or bath PUVA because it is more convenient to use. NB‐UVB seemed to be equal to selective BB‐UVB for clearing CPP. Evidence regarding NB‐UVB and conventional BB‐UVB is limited. The long‐term safety of NB‐UVB needs to be confirmed. The efficacy of NB‐UVB for clearing PPP needs to be confirmed in future studies. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD006251.pub4': \"Interventions to reduce injuries in construction workers\\nOccupational injury rates among construction workers are the highest among the major industries.

However, a multifaceted safety campaign and a multifaceted drug‐free workplace programme at the company level, along with subsidies for replacement of scaffoldings, may be effective in reducing non‐fatal injuries. \\nAdditional strategies are needed to increase the employers' and workers' adherence to the safety measures that are prescribed by regulation. \\nHow up‐to‐date is this review? \\nWe searched for studies that had been published up to 1 April 2017.\\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD004508.pub4': \"Early versus delayed feeding for reducing complications after gynaecologic surgery\\nReview Question \\nWhat are the risks and benefits of eating food early, versus delaying food for at least 24 hours after abdominal gynaecologic surgery? \\nBackground \\nPhysicians often delay giving food and drink to women after abdominal gynaecologic surgery (uterine fibroids, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, uterine and ovarian cancer) until bowel function recommences (typically 24 hours after surgery). This is to reduce the risk of complications such as vomiting, gastrointestinal disruptions and wound rupturing or leakage. However, it has been suggested that some women may recover more quickly if food is introduced earlier. We reviewed evidence from randomised controlled trials of early and delayed feeding after abdominal gynaecologic surgery. \\nStudy Characteristics \\nWe assessed evidence on the following outcomes:\\n1. Nausea, vomiting, cramping abdominal pain, bloating, abdominal distension, wound complication, deep venous thrombosis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia. \\n2. Time to first: bowel sound, gas, stool, start of regular diet.\\n3. Length of hospital stay\\nEarly feeding was defined as having fluids or food within 24 hours of surgery. Delayed feeding was defined as having fluids or food 24 hours after surgery, and only if there are bowel sounds, passage of gas or stool, and a feeling of hunger. \\nThe evidence is current to April 2014\\nKey Results \\nWe included five published studies of 631 women, mainly with gynaecologic cancer.\\nRecovery of bowel function was faster in those with early feeding. There was no difference in rates of nausea or vomiting, abdominal distension, need for a postoperative nasogastric tube or time to first bowel movement, but early feeding was associated with a shorter time to bowel sounds and onset of gas. The early feeding group resumed a solid diet 1½ days sooner than those having delayed feeding and the hospital stay was one day shorter. Also, the early feeding group were more satisfied with the feeding schedule, although only one study reported this. \\nEarly feeding appeared safe, without increased postoperative complications and with fewer infectious complications overall. \\nQuality of the Evidence \\nMost of the evidence was moderate quality. The main limitation was lack of blinding, which could influence the findings for subjective outcomes such as self‐reported symptoms, hospital stay, patients' satisfaction and quality of life. \\nConclusions \\nThe evidence suggests that eating and drinking on the first day after abdominal gynaecologic surgery is safe and could reduce the length of hospital stay. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD005293.pub2': \"Treatments for accidental damage during surgery to the nerves supplying sensation to the tongue, lower lip and chin \\nReview question \\nThe main question addressed by this review is how effective are different treatments and what are the best timings for these treatments following accidental damage during surgery to the nerves that supply sensation to the tongue, lower lip and chin. \\nBackground \\nThe nerves (alveolar and lingual) supplying sensation to the tongue, lower lip and chin, may be injured as a result of surgical treatments to the mouth and face, including surgery to remove lower wisdom teeth. The vast majority (90%) of these injuries are temporary and get better within eight weeks. However if they last for longer than six months they are considered to be permanent. Damage to these nerves can lead to altered sensation in the region of the lower lip and chin, or tongue or both. Furthermore, damage to the nerve supplying the tongue may lead to altered taste perception. These injuries can affect people's quality of life leading to emotional problems, problems with socialising and disabilities. Accidental injury after surgery can also give rise to legal action. \\nThere are many interventions or treatments available, surgical and non‐surgical, that may enhance recovery, including improving sensation. They can be grouped as. \\n1. Surgical – a variety of procedures. 2. Laser treatment – low‐level laser treatment has been used to treat partial loss of sensation. 3. Medical – treatment with drugs including antiepileptics, antidepressants and painkillers. 4. Counselling – including cognitive behavioural and relaxation therapy, changing behaviour and hypnosis. \\nStudy characteristics \\nThe Cochrane Oral Health Group carried out this review, and the evidence is current as of 9 October 2013. There are two studies included, both published in 1996, which compared low‐level laser treatment to placebo or fake treatment for partial loss of sensation following surgery to the lower jaw. There were 15 participants in one study and 16 in the other, their ages ranging from 17 to 55 years. All had suffered accidental damage to nerves of the lower jaw and tongue causing some loss of sensation following surgery. \\nKey results \\nLow‐level laser therapy was the only treatment to be evaluated in the included studies and this was compared to fake or placebo laser therapy. No studies were found that evaluated other surgical, medical or counselling treatments. \\nThere was some evidence of an improvement when participants reported whether or not sensation was better in the lip and chin areas with low‐level laser therapy. This is based on the results of a single, small study, so the results should be interpreted with caution. \\nNo studies reported on the effects of the treatment on other outcomes such as pain, difficulty eating or speaking or taste. No studies reported on quality of life or harm. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nThe overall quality of the evidence is very low as a result of limitations in the conduct and reporting of the two included studies and the low number of participants, and evidence from participants with only partial sensory loss. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD007726.pub3': 'Stopping or continuing long‐term antipsychotic drug use for behavioural and psychological symptoms in older people with dementia \\nReview question \\nWe investigated the effects of stopping antipsychotic drugs in older people with dementia who had been taking them for three months or longer. \\nBackground \\nPeople with dementia may have symptoms and behavioural problems that can be distressing and difficult for carers to manage. Such symptoms (often described as neuropsychiatric symptoms, or NPS) include anxiety, apathy, depression, psychosis (hallucinations and delusions), wandering, repeating words or sounds, shouting, and behaving in agitated or aggressive ways, or both. \\nAntipsychotic drugs are often prescribed with the aim of controlling these symptoms and behaviours, although most current guidance suggests these drugs should only be used for short periods of time for the most challenging behaviours. This is largely because these drugs are thought to have risks of side effects (including some that are serious), and because many behavioural problems improve without treatment. However, many people with dementia continue to take antipsychotic drugs over long periods of time. \\nThis review investigated whether it is feasible for older people with dementia and NPS to stop antipsychotic drugs which they have been taking for at least three months. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2013. \\nMethods \\nWe searched up to 11 January 2018 for any study that randomly allocated some people with dementia who were taking antipsychotic drugs to continue this treatment and others to stop taking antipsychotic drugs. Study participants were followed up over a period of time to see what happened. \\nResults \\nWe included 10 studies with a total of 632 participants in our review. We added one new study with 19 participants for this update. Most participants lived in nursing homes. The studies varied considerably with regard to the people they included, the methods they used and the outcomes they measured. \\nBecause the studies were so diverse, it was not possible to combine all the data numerically. We found low‐quality evidence that older people with dementia may be able to stop long‐term antipsychotics without their behavioural problems getting worse. However, in some people who had psychosis, agitation or aggression and who had improved significantly when they first started antipsychotic treatment, we found that stopping the drugs may increase the risk of the behavioural problems getting worse again. On the other hand, agitation decreased after stopping the drugs in some participants whose NPS at the beginning of the studies was relatively mild. \\nWe did not find enough evidence to know whether stopping antipsychotics has beneficial effects on quality of life, thinking and remembering, or the ability to carry out daily tasks, nor if the risk of harmful events ‐ such as falls ‐ is reduced. We are uncertain whether stopping antipsychotics leads to people living longer. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nOverall, evidence was low‐ or very low‐quality. This means we have limited or little confidence in the results, and that it is possible that other similar research could find something different. The main reasons for this assessment were that there were few studies that included few people, and a risk that results were not fully reported. All included studies had problems recruiting enough participants, making it more difficult for them to detect effects of stopping antipsychotics. \\nConclusions \\nLimited evidence suggests that stopping long‐term antipsychotic drug use in older people with dementia and NPS may be done without making their behaviour worse. There may be benefits especially for those with milder NPS. There may be people with more severe symptoms who benefit from continuing treatment, but more research in people with both milder and more severe NPS is needed to be sure about this. The overall conclusions have not changed since the last version of this review and the number of included trials is still low. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD008685.pub2': 'The optimal warfarin dose for patients beginning therapy\\nWarfarin is commonly prescribed to prevent blot clots in patients with medical conditions such as atrial fibrillation, heart valve replacement or previous blood clots. Warfarin is an effective treatment which has been used for many years but needs to be closely monitored, especially at the beginning of treatment, as there is a wide variation in response to dose. Monitoring of the response to dose is done using an International Normalized Ratio (INR) and it is important that patients remain within a narrow range (typically 2 to 3 INR) due to the need to balance the goal of preventing blood clots with the risk of causing excessive bleeding. \\nThis review included 12 randomised controlled trials comparing different warfarin doses given to patients beginning warfarin treatment. Most of the studies had a high risk of bias so the results were interpreted with caution. \\nThose trials that were included compared loading doses in several different situations. The review authors divided the trials into four categories, 5 mg versus 10 mg initial doses (four studies), 5 mg versus other doses (two studies), 5 mg or 10 mg versus age adjusted doses (two studies), 5 mg or 10 mg versus genotype adjusted doses (four studies). \\nThe review authors concluded that there is still considerable uncertainty between the use of a 5 mg and a 10 mg loading dose for the initiation of warfarin. In the elderly, there is some evidence that lower initiation doses or age adjusted doses are more appropriate. However, there is insufficient evidence to warrant genotype adjusted dosing. We also found no data to suggest that any one method was safer than another. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD001977.pub2': \"Acupuncture for osteoarthritis\\nThis summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of acupuncture on osteoarthritis. \\nThe review shows that in people with osteoarthritis, \\n‐Acupuncture may lead to small improvements in pain and physical function after 8 weeks. \\n‐Acupuncture may lead to small improvements in pain and physical function after 26 weeks. \\nWe often do not have precise information about side effects and complications. This is particularly true for rare but serious side effects.\\xa0Possible side effects of acupuncture treatment include minor bruising and bleeding at the site of needle insertion. \\nWhat is osteoarthritis and what is acupuncture? \\nOsteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints, such as your knee or hip. When the joint loses cartilage, the bone grows to try and repair the damage. Instead of making things better, however, the bone grows abnormally and makes things worse. For example, the bone can become misshapen and make the joint painful and unstable. This can affect your physical function or ability to use your knee. \\nAccording to the philosophy of traditional acupuncture, energy circulates in 'meridians' located throughout the body.\\xa0 Pain or ill health happens when something occurs to cause this meridian energy circulation to be blocked. The way to restore health is to stimulate the appropriate combination of acupuncture points in the body by inserting very thin needles.\\xa0 Sometimes in painful conditions, electrical stimulation along with the needles is also used.\\xa0 According to acupuncture theory, one way you can tell that acupuncture is relieving pain is that you may feel numbness or tingling, called de qi, where the needle is inserted. \\nBest estimate of what happens to people with osteoarthritis who have acupuncture: \\nPain after 8 weeks: \\n‐People who had acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by about 4 points on a scale of 0 to 20.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by about 3 points on a scale of 0 to 20. \\n‐People who received acupuncture had a 1 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐20.\\xa0 (5% absolute improvement). \\nPain after 26 weeks: \\n‐People who had acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by slightly more than 3 points on a scale of 0 to 20.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by slightly less than 3 points on a scale of 0 to 20. \\n‐People who received acupuncture had under a 1 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐20.\\xa0 (2% absolute improvement).\\xa0 \\nPhysical function after 8 weeks : \\n‐People who had acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 11 points on a scale of 0 to 68.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 8 points on a scale of 0 to 68. \\n‐People who received acupuncture had about a 3 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐68.\\xa0 (4% absolute improvement)\\xa0 \\nPhysical function after 26 weeks : \\n‐People who had acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 11 points on a scale of 0 to 68.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 10 points on a scale of 0 to 68. \\n‐People who received acupuncture had about a 1 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐68.\\xa0 (2% absolute improvement) \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD004474.pub2': 'Tongxinluo (a traditional Chinese medicine) capsules may help patients suffering from unstable angina \\nTongxinluo, in capsule form, is a traditional Chinese medicine which consists of herbs and insects. Traditionally it has been thought to have clinical benefits for patients with angina, including the reduction of the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and complications of some types of heart surgery. Some studies also suggest a possible benefit in reducing the frequency and severity of angina attacks and improving symptoms. However, none of these individual studies have been reviewed systematically. \\nThe review authors systematically reviewed evidence from 18 randomised controlled trials for the benefit of tongxinluo with or without other treatments, including routine care or placebo, for patients with unstable angina. All the trials were conducted in China. The total number of participants was 1413, ranging in age from 25 to 88 years. Most studies randomised patients to receive tongxinluo with conventional medication or conventional medications alone. \\nThere was some evidence from seven studies that tongxinluo improved the electrocardiogram (ECG) changes indicating ischaemia and reduced the number of people with no improvement or worsening of ECG (six studies). Some improvement in angina symptoms (10 studies) and reduced numbers of people showing no improvement or worsening of symptoms were apparent with tongxinluo. Tongxinluo appeared to be as effective as isosorbide mononitrate in three studies. A few cases of slight gastrointestinal discomfort were reported after giving tongxinluo in seven studies and three cases of breaking of tiny blood vessels under the skin (ecchymosis) in one study. \\nThe evidence suggested possible benefits relating to a range of outcomes among patients with unstable angina but all the studies were of poor quality and neither blinding nor allocation concealment were used. This makes it impossible to reach firm conclusions about the benefit of this treatment. Large, high quality, randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the possible benefit of tongxinluo for unstable angina and to suggest appropriate future use of this herbal medicine. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD008011.pub3': 'Treatment for cardiac problems caused by anthracycline chemotherapy for childhood cancer \\nAnthracyclines are anticancer drugs used in the treatment of different types of childhood cancer. An important adverse effect of anthracyclines is damage to the heart, which can lead to asymptomatic (without complaints) or symptomatic (with complaints) cardiac problems during and after cancer treatment. While there are several drugs available to treat other types of cardiac problems in adults, it is not known if these drugs are beneficial in treating cardiac problems caused by anthracyclines in childhood cancer patients and survivors. A physician confronted with a childhood cancer patient or survivor with anthracycline‐induced cardiac problems should be able to make an informed decision on how to treat this patient based on high‐quality evidence about the beneficial and adverse effects of the treatment options. We searched for and summarised studies that evaluated drugs for treating anthracycline‐induced cardiac problems in childhood cancer patients and survivors. \\nWe identified two randomised studies evaluating two different drugs in two different types of patients. One of these drugs, an angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril), had a short‐term beneficial effect on heart function in survivors of childhood cancer with asymptomatic cardiac problems caused by anthracyclines compared with placebo. However, the drug had no significant beneficial effect on other important outcomes and was associated with side effects such as dizziness and fatigue. This study was of reasonable/good quality. The other study was of low quality and found no effect of a short treatment with phosphocreatine in childhood leukaemia patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic cardiac problems compared with a control treatment with vitamin C, adenosine triphosphate, vitamin E, and oral coenzyme Q10. \\nWe could make no definitive conclusions about treatment options for anthracycline‐induced cardiac problems in childhood cancer patients and survivors.

For the cornea to remain transparent, it must have a healthy surface layer of epithelium, a stable tear film, and an absence of blood vessels. The epithelium is the moist cellular layer that covers the cornea, the white part of the eye, and the inside of the eyelids. The epithelium that covers the cornea is different from the epithelium of the conjunctiva. It is maintained in this state by a population of specialised stem cells found at the margin of the cornea (the limbus). In the normal eye, corneal epithelial cells slowly migrate from the limbus towards the centre of the cornea. \\nA burn to the eye initially damages the surface epithelial layer, but it can also damage the deeper structures of the eye and the eyelids. A characteristic of an acute burn is an epithelial defect. This defect can fully recover after a minor burn. However, if the burn damages the stem cells of a segment of the limbus, the normal epithelium central to that area may not recover. The cornea is then covered by a functionally different type of epithelium derived from the peripheral conjunctiva, which may take weeks or months, and the cornea can become hazy and vascularised. In the absence of any epithelial covering, an additional risk is that the deeper tissues of the exposed cornea (stroma) may become progressively thinner and eventually perforate. The more extensive the damage to the limbus (measured in clock hours), the worse the outcome. The abnormal surface of the cornea, as well as haze and damage to structures within the eye (iris, lens, retina, optic nerve), can all lead to loss of vision. \\nTreatments for ocular burns \\nA burn to the surface of the eye is an emergency, and the eye must be washed immediately with water or saline to remove any chemical agents. The amount of damage to the epithelium (an epithelial defect) and the blood vessels at the edge of the cornea are measured, estimating the risk of future complications. The eye is then treated with medicines to reduce the risk of further complications and help the epithelial layer recover. Some doctors also use an amniotic tissue membrane placed over the surface of the eye. The amniotic membrane is the sac that surrounds a baby as it develops inside its mother. \\nWhy we did this Cochrane Review \\nWe wanted to know whether using an amniotic membrane with medicines is better than just medicines. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe looked for studies in which an amniotic membrane was used to treat eyes that had been burned. We then looked for studies comparing eyes treated with medicines and an amniotic membrane patch with eyes treated using only medicines. We looked for randomised controlled trials, in which the treatment that people received was decided at random because these studies give the most reliable evidence about the effect of treatment. We assessed the treatment of moderate burns and severe burns separately, because they have different outcomes. We measured whether the treatment worked by comparing the proportion of eyes in which the epithelium over the cornea had failed to recover 21 days after the injury, visual function at the end of treatment, the presence of abnormal new blood vessels on the cornea, scarring between the cornea and the lids, the time taken for the epithelium to heal and adverse events in the intervention and control groups. We assessed the risk of bias in the randomised controlled study findings across pre‐specified domains. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to evaluate certainty of evidence include risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias.\\xa0 \\nWhat we found \\nWe found two randomised controlled studies comparing the effect of medicines with the addition of an amniotic membrane patch inserted within seven days of the injury against medicines alone. One study suggested that treatment with amnion may be beneficial in moderate burns, but we found the certainty of the evidence to be low due to a high risk of bias and serious imprecision. For severe burns, there were no important differences between eyes that received an amniotic membrane and eyes that did not.\\xa0 \\nConclusions \\nThere is only uncertain evidence from randomised controlled studies of an important difference in healing between eyes treated with medicines and an amniotic membrane within seven days of an ocular burn and eyes that are treated only with medicines. Further research is needed to identify the best treatment for acute burns to the eye to reduce the risk of potentially devastating consequences and visual loss. \\nHow up to date is this review?Searches were last done in September 2021. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD009961.pub2': 'Preventing bleeding in people with congenital bleeding disorders during and after surgery \\nIn haemophilia and other congenital bleeding disorders blood does not clot properly, which can cause excessive bleeding. This is particularly relevant during surgery, when the risk of bleeding depends on the type and severity of the clotting disorder and on the type of surgery. Therefore, during and after surgery, these individuals should receive treatment to improve the ability of their blood to clot and so prevent bleeding. Clotting factor concentrates (when available and appropriate in those individuals missing specific clotting proteins) or other non‐specific drugs for clotting, or a combination of both, are administered. It is not known what is the optimal dose or duration or method of administration of these treatments in these circumstances. \\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy (mortality, blood loss, need for re‐intervention, subjective assessment of efficacy, duration and dose of therapy) and the safety of any type of treatment given to people with congenital bleeding disorders during any type of surgery. We found four trials to be included in this review. Two trials evaluated 59 people with haemophilia A or B receiving antifibrinolytic drugs (agents that reduce the breakdown of clots) or placebo in addition to the initial standard treatment before dental extractions. The remaining two trials evaluated 53 people with haemophilia A or B and inhibitors (antibodies that act against the factor concentrate therapy) receiving an different clotting concentrate, recombinant activated factor VII, both during and after surgery. These two trials evaluated different treatment options: high‐dose compared with low‐dose and a single large (bolus) infusion compared with continuous infusion. \\nThe trials included in this review provide some information in two specific situations in people with congenital bleeding disorders undergoing surgery. However, on the whole, there is not enough evidence from trials to define the best treatments for the various types of disease and types of surgery. Further trials would be useful to improve our knowledge but are difficult to carry out and currently do not appear to be a clinical priority.

The treatment for this disease is insulin administration, with basal and bolus insulin preparations being its main stay. Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin had previously been considered the standard of care for basal insulin replacement in blood glucose lowering for people with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Over the years, newer and longer acting insulins with a more physiological action profile became available: insulin ultralente, and later insulin glargine and insulin detemir. Their theoretical advantages lead to the thought of a beneficial effect on glucose level and rate of complications, such as very low levels of glucose or long term complications. The aim of this review was to assess whether this theoretical advantage is translated into real‐life benefits, by comparing the effect of long acting insulins to intermediate acting insulins on diabetes control.  Twenty‐three studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria with a total of 3872 and 2915 participants in the intervention and in the control group, respectively. The methodological quality of all the studies was rated intermediate to low. Trials duration was no longer than one year. The level of glycosylated haemoglobin, a marker of diabetes control, was lower in the long acting insulin group, but the observed difference was of doubtful clinical significance. Longer acting insulins were superior mostly in their nocturnal effect, which resulted in a lower level of fasting glucose levels and fewer episodes of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. No data on long term complications were available.  The currently available data can not substantiate conclusions on the benefits and risks of long acting insulins, and long‐term data are of need. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD002779.pub3': 'Interventions for treating burning mouth syndrome\\nReview question \\nWhich treatments help to relieve symptoms for people with burning mouth syndrome (BMS)?\\nBackground \\nBMS is a common painful condition. Symptoms include burning, dryness or uncomfortable sensations in the mouth and changes to taste, with no obvious underlying medical or dental cause. BMS is usually persistent and suffered long term, and can lead to a reduced quality of life (QoL). Currently, scientific research suggests that BMS is caused by underlying damage to the nerves.

We were unable to show whether dietary supplements or treatments applied to the mouth surface provide symptom relief in the short term or not. \\nShort‐term relief was not reported for the single study that assessed a psychological therapy. \\nLong‐term symptom relief  \\nWe found evidence of long‐term symptom relief for psychological therapy (one study, 30 participants), chili pepper mouthrinse (one study, 18 participants) and the topical tranquilliser called clonazepam (one study, 66 participants). \\nWe found there was no difference in long‐term symptom relief for dietary supplements or treatments applied to the mouth surface. \\nStudies which assessed antidepressants, directed energy waves, saliva stimulants, antiseizure drugs, or physical barriers did not evaluate long‐term symptom relief. \\nChange in QoL  \\nThere was evidence of short‐term improvement in QoL for directed energy waves (one study, 58 patients), although no difference was found for antidepressants, tranquillisers, dietary supplements and physical barriers. No study assessed long‐term QoL changes. \\nChange in taste or feeling of dryness  \\nA few studies assessed short‐term change in taste or feeling of dryness (none evaluated these outcomes long‐term), but there was not enough evidence to judge the effects of treatment on these outcomes. \\nSide effects  \\nSide effects were more likely to be experienced with antidepressants (dizziness and drowsiness more likely: one study, 37 people), and with a dietary supplement called alpha lipoic acid (also known as ALA) with or without other ingredients (headaches more likely: two studies, 118 people; and upset stomachs more likely: three studies, 138 people). \\nQuality of the evidence  Overall, we found very low‐quality evidence for each short‐ and long‐term outcome we investigated (symptom relief; changes in QoL, taste and feeling of dryness; and side effects) in all types of assessed treatment: antidepressants and antipsychotics, antiseizure drugs, types of tranquillisers, saliva stimulants, dietary supplements, directed energy waves, physical barriers (except side effects, which was assessed as low quality), psychological therapies, and treatments applied to the mouth surface.

Both methods contain the hormones estrogen and progestin. The patch is a small, thin, adhesive square that is applied to the skin. The contraceptive vaginal ring is a flexible, lightweight device that is inserted into the vagina. Both methods release drugs like those in birth control pills. These methods could be used more consistently than pills because they do not require a daily dose. This review looked at how well the methods worked to prevent pregnancy, if they caused bleeding problems, if women used them as prescribed, and how safe they were. \\nThrough February 2013, we did computer searches for randomized controlled trials of the skin patch or vaginal ring compared to pills for birth control. Pills included types with both estrogen and progestin. We wrote to researchers to find other trials. \\nWe found 18 trials. Of six patch trials, five compared the marketed patch to birth control pills and one studied a patch being developed. Of 12 ring trials, 11 looked at the marketed ring and pills while one studied a ring being developed. The methods compared had similar pregnancy rates. Patch users reported using their method more consistently than the pill group did. Only half of the patch studies had data on pregnancy or whether the women used the method correctly. However, most of the ring studies had those data. \\nPatch users were more likely than pill users to drop out early from the trial. Ring users were not more likely to drop out early. Compared to pill users, users of the marketed patch had more breast discomfort, painful periods, nausea, and vomiting. Ring users had more vaginal irritation and discharge than pill users but less nausea, acne, irritability, depression, and emotional changes. Ring users often had fewer bleeding problems than pill users. \\nThe quality of information was classed as low for the patch trials and moderate for the ring studies. Lower quality was due to not reporting how groups were assigned or not having good outcome measures. Other issues were high losses and taking assigned women out of the analysis. Studies of the patch and ring should provide more detail on whether women used the method correctly. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD010382.pub2': \"Non‐drug management of breathing problems for children with severe physical and intellectual impairment \\nBackground For a variety of reasons, some children live with very severe intellectual and physical problems; they are unable to walk or talk and require a lot of care. In this study we refer to them as children with severe global developmental delay (SGDD); this is not a specific diagnosis but is rather an 'umbrella term' used to describe a group of children with similar problems. These children may have weak or stiff muscles and deformities of their skeleton; often they have problems with swallowing, resulting in food or saliva going into their lungs. Frequently they have a poor cough reflex and lack the strength required to expel secretions when they do cough. When we sleep, our breathing becomes shallower; for some children with SGDD whose breathing is already shallow when awake, falling asleep means that they do not breathe sufficiently deeply to take in enough oxygen and breathe out enough carbon dioxide. The consequence of these problems is that their respiratory system becomes weakened; they are more likely to develop chest infections, and relatively minor infections can make them very unwell. This can result in their spending a lot of time in hospital. This affects the quality of life for these children and families and is very expensive. Many types of treatment could help, but no good summary of studies has been prepared to tell healthcare professionals which treatments are best and when they should be used; this is the reason for this review. \\nReview question The aim of our review was to discover how effective each type of treatment is for managing breathing problems in children with severe global developmental delay. As so many treatments are available, we decided to look only at treatments that do not involve drugs. \\nStudy characteristics We carried out a wide database search to look for studies of interventions for the management of breathing problems in children with severe neurological impairment. We found 15 studies of interest, which included a number of different types of treatment. \\nKey results The results showed that several different treatments provided potential benefits, and for most interventions no serious adverse effects were reported. However, the quality of the studies was not good enough to inspire confidence in the findings. Night‐time positioning equipment and spinal bracing were shown to have a potentially negative effect in some participants. Although some studies looked at the same type of treatment, they used it in different ways or used different measures to assess effectiveness, so we could not put the results together. \\nQuality of the evidence Of the 15 studies included here, only four used the 'gold standard' study design for health interventions. The remainder of the studies used less robust study designs, which limits the strength of the results. Further well‐designed randomised studies including larger numbers of participants are required to guide healthcare professionals to select the most effective treatments. \\nThis plain‐language summary is current to November 2013.\\xa0 We updated searches in November 2019 and July 2020 and added six studies to awaiting classification, but these results have not been fully incorporated into the review. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD004019.pub4': \"Osteotomy for treating knee osteoarthritis\\nResearchers from The Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review of the effects of an osteotomy in people with osteoarthritis of the knee. Upon searching for all relevant studies until November 2013, they found 21 studies that included up to 1065 people. Their findings are summarised below. \\nThis review shows that in people with osteoarthritis of the knee:\\n• osteotomy can improve pain and function, but this is based on changes within a treatment group. No studies compared osteotomy versus conservative treatment; and • no evidence can be found for a preferred osteotomy technique. \\nWhat is osteoarthritis of the knee, and what is an osteotomy?  Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints, such as the knee or the hip. When the joint loses cartilage, the bone grows to try to repair the damage. Instead of making things better, however, the bone grows abnormally and makes things worse. For example, the bone can become misshapen, and this can make the joint painful and unstable. This can affect physical function or ability to use the knee. Two main types of surgery are used to treat patients with osteoarthritis of the knee: knee replacement and osteotomy. \\nOsteotomy is surgery in which the bones are cut and realigned. Osteotomy around the knee changes the alignment of the knee. Weight bearing will be shifted from the diseased part to a healthy part of the knee. By 'unloading' the damaged cartilage of the knee, osteotomy may decrease pain, improve function, slow knee deterioration and possibly delay the need for (partial or) total knee replacement surgery. \\nWhat happens to people after an osteotomy for knee osteoarthritis?  Follow‐up of all studies was too short to allow scoring of treatment failure; this refers to a revision to a knee replacement. \\nIn all studies, people reported less pain and improved knee function and quality of life after any type of high tibial osteotomy. However this comparison is based on differences before and after an osteotomy, not on comparison with non‐operative treatment. Probably no differences in pain and function scores are noted between different osteotomy techniques. \\nRare complications may include thromboembolism and lesions to nerves and vascular structures. \\nThe most important reasons for reoperation include hardware removal resulting from pain and pin track infection due to the external fixator. This reoperation rate may be higher in patients undergoing another high tibial osteotomy technique compared with those treated with the closing wedge technique. \\nTwo studies compared high tibial osteotomy versus partial knee replacement. Benefits did not differ between these types of surgery. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD001218.pub3': \"Acupuncture for preventing migraine attacks\\nBottom line \\nThe available evidence suggests that a course of acupuncture consisting of at least six treatment sessions can be a valuable option for people with migraine. \\nBackground \\nIndividuals with migraine have repeated attacks of severe headache, usually just on one side and often with vomiting. Acupuncture is a therapy in which thin needles are inserted into the skin at particular points. It originated in China, and is now used in many countries to treat people with migraine. We evaluated whether acupuncture reduces the number of episodes of migraine. We looked at the number of people in whom the number of migraine days per month was reduced by half or more than half. \\nKey results \\nFor this update, we reviewed 22 trials with 4985 people, published up to January 2016. We omitted five trials from the original review because they included people who had had migraine for less than 12 months. We included five new trials in this update. \\nIn four trials, acupuncture added to usual care or treatment of migraine on onset only (usually with pain‐killers) resulted in 41 in 100 people having the frequency of headaches at least halved, compared to 17 of 100 people given usual care only. \\nIn 15 trials, acupuncture was compared with 'fake' acupuncture, where needles are inserted at incorrect points or do not penetrate the skin. The frequency of headaches halved in 50 of 100 people receiving true acupuncture, compared with 41 of 100 people receiving 'fake' acupuncture. The results were dominated by three good quality large trials (with about 1200 people) showing that the effect of true acupuncture was still present after six months. There were no differences in the number of side effects of real and 'fake' acupuncture, or the numbers dropping out because of side effects. \\nIn five trials, acupuncture was compared to a drug proven to reduce the frequency of migraine attacks, but only three trials provided useful information. At three months, headache frequency halved in 57 of 100 people receiving acupuncture, compared with 46 of 100 people taking the drug. After six months, headache frequency halved in 59 of 100 people receiving acupuncture, compared with 54 of 100 people taking the drug. People receiving acupuncture reported side effects less often than people receiving drugs, and were less likely to drop out of the trial. \\nOur findings about the number of days with migraine per month can be summarized as follows. If people have six days with migraine per month on average before starting treatment, this would be reduced to five days in people receiving only usual care, to four days in those receiving fake acupuncture or a prophylactic drug, and to three and a half days in those receiving true acupuncture. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nOverall the quality of the evidence was moderate.\\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD005088.pub4': 'Bisphosphonate therapy for osteogenesis imperfecta\\nReview question \\nWe reviewed the evidence about the effect and safety of bisphosphonates in increasing bone mineral density, reducing fractures and improving clinical function in people with osteogenesis imperfecta. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. \\nBackground \\nOsteogenesis imperfecta is also known as brittle bone disease. It is a genetic condition which can be passed on from a parent to child or occur in the child without any other family history. An affected person is at risk for frequent breaks of the long bones or collapse of the bones of the spine. There is no cure for osteogenesis imperfecta and treatment is mostly supportive. \\nSearch date \\nThe evidence is current to: 28 April 2016.\\nStudy characteristics \\nThis review looked at trials studying one of the groups of medications known as bisphosphonates which are more typically used to treat osteoporosis. They are used in osteogenesis imperfecta to try and reduce the number of bone fractures in affected individuals. \\nWe included 14 trials, and most of these did not show a major reduction in fractures in affected individuals when treated with bisphosphonates. \\nKey results \\nEach trial independently showed significant improvements in bone mineral density after treatment with oral or intravenous bisphosphonates. Bone pain, growth and quality of life indicators were not reported in enough detail and the effects of this treatment need further investigation. The long‐term effectiveness and safety of bisphosphates, as well as dose and duration of therapy, require extended evaluation \\nQuality of the evidence \\nThe majority of trials analysed were small and not powered to show a statistically significant difference in many outcome measures. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD005457.pub4': 'Carbetocin for preventing postpartum haemorrhage\\nIn low‐ and middle‐income countries, postpartum haemorrhage is a major cause of maternal deaths and ill health. In high‐income countries, the problems are much less but there is still a small risk of major bleeding problems for women after giving birth. Active management of the third stage of labour, which is generally used to reduce blood loss at birth, consists of giving the mother a drug that helps the uterus to contract, early cord clamping and controlled cord traction to deliver the placenta. Different drugs have been tried and generally either intramuscular oxytocin or intramuscular syntometrine is given. Carbetocin is an oxytocin agonist. Oxytocin agonists are a group of drugs that mimic the oxytocin action, oxytocin being the natural hormone that helps to reduce blood loss at birth. This review includes 11 randomised controlled trials involving 2635 women. The trials compared carbetocin against either oxytocin or syntometrine given after delivery, vaginally or by caesarean section. The comparison between intramuscular carbetocin and oxytocin showed that there was no difference in the risk of heavy bleeding, but that women who received carbetocin were less likely to require other medications to produce uterine contractions following caesarean sections. Comparisons between carbetocin and syntometrine showed that women who received carbetocin had less blood loss compared to women who received syntometrine after vaginal delivery, and were much less likely to experience side effects such as nausea and vomiting. The incidence of hypertension at 30 and 60 minutes post delivery was also significantly lower in women who received carbetocin compared to those who received syntometrine. Five of the 11 studies were known to be supported by a pharmaceutical company. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD009359.pub2': 'Racecadotril to treat children under five years of age with acute diarrhoea\\nWhat was the aim of this review? \\nThe aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether racecadotril works for children under five years of age with diarrhoea. Cochrane Review authors collected and analysed all relevant trials to answer this question and included seven trials in this review. \\nKey messages \\nRacecadotril may reduce the risk of rehydration failure. We are uncertain whether or not it influences number of bowel movements or duration of diarrhoea. \\nWhat was studied in the review? \\nDiarrhoea is a leading cause of death in children under five years old, especially in low‐income countries. Children who have diarrhoea often suffer from frequent and watery bowel movements, which might cause excessive loss of fluid and electrolytes (dehydration). Fluid replacement is recommended to prevent and treat dehydration caused by diarrhoea. Racecadotril has been used in addition to fluid replacement for treating diarrhoea in children, as it reduces release of water and electrolytes into the digestive tract. The drug is supposed to improve the symptoms of diarrhoea (shorten duration of diarrhoea or reduce the stool frequency) as well as reduce the risk of rehydration failure. However, it is not clear if racecadotril really works for children with diarrhoea. \\nWhat are the main results? \\nThe review authors searched for available trials and included seven trials. The trials were conducted in a total of 1140 children aged from 3 months to 5 years. Children who were given racecadotril were compared to a control group (children who, instead of racecadotril, received a placebo (a dummy drug that contains no racecadotril) or no drug). The review shows that when children with diarrhoea were given racecadotril, compared to placebo or no drug: \\n• racecadotril may reduce the risk of rehydration failure (low‐certainty evidence); • we are uncertain whether or not racecadotril shortens duration of diarrhoea (very low‐certainty evidence); • we are uncertain whether racecadotril influences the number of stools (very low‐certainty evidence); • racecadotril may reduce weight of stool output (low‐certainty evidence); • racecadotril may make little or no difference to length of hospital stay for inpatients (low‐certainty evidence); • racecadotril may make little or no difference to rates of side‐effect events (low‐certainty evidence) \\nHow up to date is this review? \\nThe review authors searched for trials published up to 4 March 2019.\\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD006919.pub4': 'Gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) used as an adjuvant to gonadotrophins in assisted reproduction treatments \\nReview question \\nResearchers from the Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence about the most effective way of using gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) as part of controlled ovarian stimulation in women undergoing assisted reproduction technology (ART). \\nBackground \\nGnRHa are given along with hormone injections that stimulate the ovaries, in an attempt to prevent spontaneous release of eggs prior to their planned surgical retrieval. GnRHa have been proven to improve pregnancy rates; however, various regimens are described in the literature. We conducted this review to identify the most effective regimens. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe found 37 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 3872 women comparing the use of GnRHa in various protocols. Twenty of these RCTs (1643 women) compared a long protocol with a short protocol. The evidence is current to April 2015. \\nKey results \\nIn comparisons of long GnRHa protocols (where GnRHa is given for at least 14 days prior to the start of ovarian stimulation) versus short GnRHa protocols (when the GnRHa is given at the start of stimulation) there was no conclusive evidence of a difference in live birth and ongoing pregnancy rates. However there was moderate quality evidence of higher clinical pregnancy rates in the long protocol groups. Our findings suggest that in a population in which 14% of women achieve live birth or ongoing pregnancy using a short protocol, between 13% and 23% will achieve live birth or ongoing pregnancy using a long protocol. \\nNone of the other analyses showed any evidence of a difference in birth or pregnancy outcomes between the protocols compared. There was insufficient evidence to make any conclusions regarding adverse effects. Further research is needed to determine which long protocol is most cost effective and acceptable to women. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nThe quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low. The main limitations in the evidence were failure to report live birth or ongoing pregnancy, poor reporting of methods in the primary studies, and imprecise findings due to lack of data. Only 10 of the 37 included studies were conducted within the last 10 years. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD003459.pub4': \"Methotrexate for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease\\nAlthough corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission of Crohn's disease, many patients relapse when steroids are withdrawn or become steroid dependent. Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant side effects. Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug that is used to treat active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. This review includes seven randomized trials with a total of 495 participants. There is evidence from one large study which suggests that methotrexate (25 mg/week) injected intramuscularly for 16 weeks among patients with active treatment resistant Crohn's disease may provide a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids. This reduction in steroid use could reduce steroid‐induced side effects for people with chronic Crohn's disease. Although side effects are more common with high dose methotrexate therapy, no serious side effects have been observed. Common side effects associated with methotrexate therapy include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash and headache. Studies comparing lower dose oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) to placebo (e.g. sugar pill) or other active drugs (e.g. azathioprine or 6‐mercaptopurine) indicate that lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any benefit for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. However, these trials were small in size and further studies of oral methotrexate may be justified. Two studies looked at the combination of methotrexate and infliximab (a biological drug) compared to infliximab therapy alone. These studies indicated that the addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infiximab. However these studies were relatively small and further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD008819.pub4': 'Wearing stockings to provide compression for the treatment of varicose veins\\nReview question \\nWhat is the effectiveness of compression stockings as the only and initial treatment of varicose veins in people without healed or active venous ulceration (leg ulcers)? \\nBackground \\nVaricose veins are widened veins that twist and turn and are visible under the skin of the legs. They generally do not cause medical problems, although many people seek medical advice. Symptoms may include pain, ankle swelling, tired legs, restless legs, night cramps, heaviness, itching and distress from their cosmetic appearance. Complications such as oedema (build‐up of fluid), pigmentation, inflammation (swelling, redness and pain) and ulceration (sores) can also develop. Compression stockings are often the first line of treatment and come in a variety of lengths from knee‐length to full tights, and apply different pressures to support the flow of blood in the veins. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe included 13 studies involving 1021 participants with varicose veins who had not experienced venous ulceration in this review (search run May 2020). Five studies assessed compression stocking versus no compression stocking (for example no treatment or placebo stocking with no graduated elastic). Three of these studies used knee‐length stockings, one used full‐length stockings and one used full tights. Eight studies compared different types or pressures of knee‐length stockings. The stockings used in the studies exerted different levels of pressure. One study included only pregnant women, while other studies included people who had sought medical intervention for their varicose veins by being on surgical waiting lists, or attending vascular surgery or dermatology (skin care) clinics or outpatient departments. \\nKey results \\nParticipants considered their symptoms had improved when stockings were worn in the nine studies that assessed this outcome, but these assessments were not always made by comparing one treatment group of the trial with a control group in the same study and was therefore subject to bias. \\nTwo studies comparing stockings with placebo stockings measured physical signs; there was no clear difference between baseline and follow‐up for ankle circumference, while oedema was reduced in the stocking group compared with the placebo stocking group. Generally there were no clear differences between studies comparing two types of stockings for volume reduction and change in diameter (ways to measure oedema). \\nComplications or side effects ranged from sweating, itching, irritation, skin dryness and a feeling of tightness. There were no severe or long‐lasting side effects. \\nTwo studies comparing stockings with different stockings, and four studies comparing stockings with placebo/no treatment assessed compliance (whether the person used the stockings as directed). In the stocking versus different stocking studies, there was no clear difference between the stockings, with generally low levels of compliance reported. In the stocking versus placebo/no treatment group, three studies reported results. Of these, one study reported a high initial dropout rate with generally low levels of compliance. The other two studies reported generally good compliance in the stocking group. Some reasons provided for non‐compliance included discomfort, difficulty in putting the stockings on, appearance, not being effective and causing irritation. \\nFour studies that compared stockings with different stockings and two studies that compared stockings with placebo/no treatment assessed comfort, tolerance and acceptability of stockings. Comparing stockings with placebo/no treatment, comfort, tolerance and acceptability was affected by the study population. Compression tights were increasingly rejected by pregnant women as their pregnancy progressed, while in a study of non‐pregnant women, the stockings group showed no more hindrance of normal activities and daytime discomfort when compared with placebo stockings. In the stocking versus different stockings studies, two studies reported similar levels of tolerance and discomfort between the types of stocking. Discomfort was the main reason for indicating a preference for one type of stocking over another. \\nOne study assessed quality of life, showing no clear differences between the stocking and no stocking groups. \\nNo conclusions regarding the optimum length or pressure of compression stockings could be made as there were no conclusive results from the included studies.\\xa0 \\nCertainty of the evidence \\nThe certainty of the evidence was low or very low because of risk of bias due to poor reporting, not all studies assessed the same outcomes, they assessed them in different ways, or reported them in a way that they could be combined and analysed with other studies. Evidence from available trials is not sufficient to determine if compression stockings as the only and initial treatment are effective in managing and treating varicose veins in the early stages. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD007287.pub4': 'Antigen‐specific active immunotherapy for ovarian cancer\\nBackground  Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynaecological cancers. Standard therapy consists of surgery and chemotherapy. Responses to chemotherapy are generally good; however, most women experience relapse, for which no curative treatment is available. The presence of certain immune cells in tumours is associated with longer survival. This suggests that stimulation of anti‐tumour immune responses (i.e. immunotherapy) might be a useful approach for improving outcomes among women with ovarian cancer. \\nReview question This review evaluated the feasibility of antigen‐specific active immunotherapy. Antigen‐specific active immunotherapy aims to induce anti‐tumour immune responses through administration of a tumour antigen ‐ a molecule that is expressed by tumour cells and is hardly expressed by healthy cells. Reviewers collected information on clinical outcomes, immunological responses, and side effects. \\nMain findings We identified 67 studies, which included 3632 women with ovarian cancer and were published between 1966 and 2017. The most frequently described strategy was administration of antibodies targeting the tumour antigen CA‐125 (2347 participants in 17 studies). Most of these studies primarily evaluated safety and immunological responses. Severe flu‐like and gastrointestinal symptoms occurred in 7% to 30% of participants. Researchers frequently detected antibodies and immune cells recognising the tumour antigen CA‐125, albeit response rates varied between studies. Despite these promising immunological responses, four large studies reported no survival advantage for participants treated with CA‐125‐directed antibody over those given placebo. \\nFor strategies not relying on antibody administration, similar conclusions cannot yet be drawn. Overall, study authors report that treatment was well tolerated and inflammatory side effects at the injection site were most frequently observed. Researchers observed responses of the immune system for most strategies studied, but the clinical benefit of these strategies remains to be evaluated in large trials. \\nCertainty of the evidence and conclusions Because no high‐certainty evidence of clinical benefit is currently available, antibody therapy targeting CA‐125 should not be incorporated into standard treatment in its current form. \\nBased on lack of uniformity in included studies, we strongly advocate universal adoption of response definitions, guidelines for adverse events reporting, and directives for trial conduct and reporting. Furthermore, results from ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are awaited, and further RCTs should be conducted. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD003147.pub5': \"Using positive expiratory pressure physiotherapy to clear the airways of people with cystic fibrosis \\nReview question \\nWe reviewed the evidence on the effect of positive expiratory pressure (PEP) physiotherapy to clear the airways of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). \\nBackground \\nCF affects approximately one in 3000 live births in white populations and causes frequent lung infection, due to mucus blocking the airways. Chest physiotherapy is often used to try to clear the mucus from the lungs. We wanted to discover whether using a PEP device (a form of chest physiotherapy) was better or worse than other other forms of chest physiotherapy for clearing the mucus from the lungs in people with CF. A PEP device provides positive pressure behind the mucus to try to push it out of the lungs. This is an update of a previously published review. \\nSearch date \\nThe evidence is current to 20 February 2019.\\nStudy characteristics \\nThe review includes 28 studies with 788 people (from infants to adults) with CF with mild to severe lung disease. The studies compared PEP to other methods of chest physiotherapy; the length of treatment ranged from a single session to two years of treatment. \\nKey results \\nGenerally, the efficacy of PEP is similar to other methods of chest physiotherapy such as postural drainage with percussion, active cycle of breathing techniques, autogenic drainage, oscillatory PEP devices such as the flutter and acapella, thoracic oscillating devices such as the 'Vest', and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPaP) (typically used for ventilatory support, but by changing the inspiratory and expiratory pressures on the device and combining it with huffing, BiPaP has been used for airway clearance). We found no difference between PEP and other forms of chest physiotherapy in lung function, the amount of mucus cleared from the airways or its related effects on the health of people with CF. However, the rate of flare ups of respiratory symptoms decreased in people using PEP compared to other forms of physiotherapy such as a vibrating PEP device or a vibrating vest. There was some evidence that people with CF may prefer PEP to other chest physiotherapy methods. There was no evidence of PEP causing harm, except in one study where infants performing either PEP or percussion in various positions which use gravity to help drain secretions, experienced some gastro‐oesophageal reflux (regurgitation of food) in head‐down positions; this was more severe in the group using postural drainage with percussion. In all the other trials PEP was performed in a sitting position. \\nIn 10 of the 28 studies studied single PEP treatment sessions. The results from these studies are very limited as they could not report on the number of respiratory infections and lung function did not change with just one treatment. Two one‐year studies compared PEP to postural drainage and percussion; in the study with children, PEP improved their lung function, while in the adult study, lung function declined slightly with both PEP and postural drainage and percussion. Also, the method of performing PEP was different in the two age groups. \\nAlthough PEP seems to have an advantage in reducing flare ups (based on the combined results of a few studies), different physiotherapy techniques and devices may be more or less effective at varying times and in different individuals during baseline function and chest flare ups. Each person should talk to their clinician to help choose which method of airway clearance is best for them and which they will adhere to, so as to provide the best quality of life and long‐term outcomes. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nSome studies were of low quality. These studies highlight the difficulty in comparing studies using PEP compared to other forms of chest physiotherapy. Factors such as age and severity of lung disease in the participants may affect the results as well as the method of performing each treatment. Overall, the evidence provided by this review for whether PEP reduces flare ups compared to other forms of chest physiotherapy was moderate to high quality, but evidence for other outcomes was of very low to moderate quality, as results were limited. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD004314.pub3': \"A comparison of botulinum toxin type A versus botulinum toxin type B for involuntary positioning of the head, or cervical dystonia \\nThe review question \\nWe reviewed the evidence about the effect of botulinum toxin type A (BtA) compared to botulinum toxin type B (BtB) in people with involuntary positioning of the head, or cervical dystonia. This is an update of a previous Cochrane Review and we assessed the effectiveness (reduction in severity, disability and pain) and safety of BtA versus BtB in cervical dystonia. \\nBackground \\nCervical dystonia, also called spasmodic torticollis, is a disease that causes undesired, uncontrollable, often painful, abnormal placement of the head. It is a relatively uncommon condition (affecting 57 to 280 people per million) that can be very disabling and can affect a person's quality of life negatively. In most cases the cause is unknown and no cure exists. Since cervical dystonia is normally a long‐term disease it requires long‐term treatment. \\nBotulinum toxin (Bt) is a powerful, natural chemical that can cause severe paralysis (an inability to move in the part of the body where it is applied) in animals and humans. It can also be used to treat many conditions, in particular those with involuntary muscle contractions, such as cervical dystonia. Bt is delivered by injections into the muscles that contract to produce the disease. There are different types of Bt, not all are available for treating health conditions. BtA is typically the first‐used treatment in cervical dystonia, but botulinum toxin type B (BtB) is an alternative option. The relative strength of each Bt formulation is variable, and the cost for 200 units varies from GBP 198 to GBP 308. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe performed a rigorous search of the medical literature in October 2016 and found three studies that compared a single treatment session of BtA with BtB. These studies included a total of 270 participants, with on average a moderate disease impairment. The participants remained in the studies for a short period of time ‐ between 16 and 20 weeks after the treatment. The average age of people in the studies was 53.3 years, and they had had cervical dystonia for an average of 6.6 to 7.9 years before taking part in the trials. Most, 63.3%, of the people in the studies were women. All three of the studies were funded by drug manufacturers with possible interests in the results of the studies. \\nKey results \\nThe results show little or no difference between BtA and BtB in the main measures of overall improvement and safety, including the total number of adverse (unwanted or harmful) events. There was also little or no difference between BtA and BtB in the self‐evaluations reported by the study participants. Based on the results we would expect that, out of 1000 people with cervical dystonia treated with BtB, there would be 362 more people who experience dry mouth/sore throat compared to 1000 people treated with BtA. The studies which looked at the duration of effect showed little or no difference between BtA and BtB. None of the studies examined the impact of either Bt on quality of life. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nAll of the studies included participants that were different to the average person who suffers from cervical dystonia. To be included participants had to have a history of successful treatment with Bt. People with certain types of cervical dystonia, in particular the forms that make the head turn backward or forward, were not allowed to participate in the studies. \\nNot enough participants were included across the studies for us to be completely confident in the results for the total number of adverse events, the self‐reported evaluations by participants or the pain assessment. \\nThe quality of the evidence for overall improvement and total number of adverse events was low. The quality of the evidence for more sore throat/dry mouth in people receiving BtB is moderate. The quality of the evidence where participants gave their self‐assessments is low. \\nNo definite conclusions can be drawn regarding overall safety and long‐term utility of BtA compared to BtB in cervical dystonia. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD007077.pub4': \"Partial breast irradiation for early breast cancer\\nWhat is the issue? \\nBreast cancer is the most common cancer that women get.\\nWomen with early breast cancer who choose to keep their breast need to have radiotherapy (RT) as well as surgery to remove the cancer to make sure it does not regrow in the breast. RT is treatment with high energy x‐rays. Having RT for breast cancer usually means 15 to 30 visits to the RT department, five times per week. \\nIf breast cancer does regrow in the same breast (called local recurrence), it tends to come back in the area it was removed from. Women can also grow a new cancer (new 'elsewhere primary') in another part of the same breast. We are not sure if the RT given to stop cancer regrowth where the first cancer was, stops the growth of 'elsewhere primaries.' \\nWhy does it matter? \\nWe always want to treat the smallest area we can with RT because this means fewer side effects. Treating only part of the breast could mean that RT might be able to be used again in another part of the same breast if needed. New ways of giving RT mean that treating part of the breast can be done with fewer treatments. This is likely to be easier for women and cost less money. \\nWhat did we compare? \\nWe asked if giving RT to part of the breast (called partial breast irradiation (PBI)) is as good as giving RT to the whole breast. PBI can be given with a shortened treatment duration (called accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI)). \\nFor this treatment to be acceptable, it would need to control the cancer as well as giving RT to the whole breast does. It would also be important that the PBI gives about the same side effects and breast appearance as treating the whole breast. \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe found nine studies, which involved 15,187 women. Our evidence is current to 27 August 2020. Local recurrence is probably slightly more common with APBI/PBI (moderate‐quality evidence) and the breast appearance (scored by doctors and nurses) was probably worse with APBI/PBI (moderate‐quality evidence). There is probably little difference in survival (high‐quality evidence). Late radiation fibrosis (change in breast appearance and feel) is probably increased with APBI/PBI. There are probably few differences in breast cancer‐related deaths and spread of breast cancer around the body with the use of APBI/PBI. The use of APBI/PBI makes little difference to how many women need mastectomy (removal of the whole breast) because of unacceptable late side effects or local recurrence. \\nWhat do our findings mean? \\nThis means that at the moment, PBI does not give the same cancer control in the breast as treating the whole breast, but the difference is small. It may cause worse side effects. There are seven big ongoing studies that will be important to answer this question. We hope to have a clearer answer in the next update of this review. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD007565.pub2': \"Clear survival benefit is achieved if all or most (< 1 cm remaining) of the tumour after primary surgical treatment for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer is removed \\nOvarian cancer is a cancerous growth arising from different parts of the ovary. It is the sixth most common cancer among women. Most ovarian cancers are classified as epithelial. Ovarian epithelial cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissue covering the ovary and most cases are epithelial. Primary surgery is performed to achieve optimal cytoreduction (surgical efforts aiming at removing the bulk of the tumour) as the amount of tumour that remains after surgery (residual disease) is one of the most important factors that is taken into account when determining a prognosis (prognostic factor) for survival of epithelial ovarian cancer. Optimal cytoreductive surgery remains a subject of controversy to many practising obstetric gynaecologists who specialise in the diagnosis and treatment of women with cancer of the reproductive organs (gynae‐oncologists). The Gynaecologic Oncology Group (GOG) currently defines 'optimal' as having a small aggregation of remaining cancer cells after surgery (residual tumour nodules) each measuring 1 cm or less in maximum diameter, with complete cytoreduction (microscopic disease) being the ideal surgical outcome. Although the size of residual tumour masses after surgery has been shown to be an important prognostic factor for advanced ovarian cancer, there is limited evidence to support the conclusion that the surgical procedure is directly responsible for the superior outcome associated with less residual disease. This review assessed overall and progression‐free survival of optimal primary cytoreductive surgery for women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (stages III and IV). We found 11 retrospective studies that included more than 100 women and used a multivariate analysis (used statistical adjustment for important prognostic factors) and met our inclusion criteria. Analyses showed the prognostic importance of complete cytoreduction, where the residual disease is microscopic with no visible disease, as overall (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS) were significantly prolonged in these groups of women. PFS was not reported in all of the studies but was sufficiently documented to allow firm conclusions to be drawn. When we compared suboptimal (> 1 cm) versus optimal (< 1 cm) cytoreduction the survival estimates were attenuated but remained statistically significant in favour of the lower volume disease group, but there was no significant difference in OS and only a borderline difference in PFS when residual disease of > 2 cm and < 2 cm were compared. There was a high risk of bias due to the retrospective nature of these studies. Adverse events, quality of life (QoL) and cost‐effectiveness were not reported by treatment arm or to a satisfactory level in any of the studies. During primary surgery for advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer, all attempts should be made to achieve complete cytoreduction. When this is not achievable, the surgical goal should be optimal (< 1 cm) residual disease. Due to the high risk of bias in the current evidence, randomised controlled trials should be performed to determine whether it is the surgical intervention or patient‐related and disease‐related factors that are associated with the improved survival in these groups of women. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD006487.pub2': \"Injectable local anaesthetic agents for preventing pain in participants requiring dental treatment \\nReview question \\nThis review assessed the evidence for providing successful local anaesthesia that prevents pain during a dental procedure. Included studies compared injections of local anaesthetic to help people requiring dental treatment and to prevent painful sensations tested in an experimental way (such as using cold, a sharp probe, or an electric stimulus). \\nBackground \\nAn injection of local anaesthetic prevents a person from feeling pain. It is given in one specific area rather than in the whole body. Although pain during dental treatment can be successfully managed, it is a common fear of patients. \\nSeveral different local anaesthetics are available to dentists, as well as a variety of ways to deliver them, to prevent pain. Factors that appear to influence success include increased difficulty in anaesthetizing teeth in the presence of inflammation, variable susceptibility of different teeth to local anaesthesia, different operative procedures performed on the tooth (for example, it appears easier to achieve successful anaesthesia for dental extractions than for root canal treatment), and various techniques and solutions used to give the local anaesthetic. \\nWe investigated whether injection of one local anaesthetic solution was more effective than another for preventing pain during dental treatment or during an experimental study, and whether this effect occurred quickly or lasted a sufficient length of time, if any unwanted effects occurred, and people’s experience of the dental procedures. Local adverse events might include pain during or after injection, or long‐lasting anaesthesia. Systemic effects due to the local anaesthetic solution can include allergic reactions and changes in heart rate and blood pressure. \\nStudy characteristics \\nTwo reviewers searched the literature to identify studies that compared different local anaesthetic solutions injected into people undergoing dental treatment or volunteers who had the same outcomes measured in experimental ways. Within every trial, each person was randomly assigned to receive one of the local anaesthetics under study. The search was up‐to‐date as of 31 January 2018. \\nWe found 123 trials with 19,223 male and female participants. These trials investigated pain experienced during dental treatment including surgery, extraction, periodontal (gum) treatment, tooth preparation, root canal treatment, anaesthesia of nerves within teeth (pulps) tested using an electric pulp tester or cold stimulant, and anaesthesia of soft tissues measured following pricking of gums or self‐reported by the participant. We pooled data from 68 studies (6615 participants). This resulted in eight outcomes when seven different local anaesthetic solutions were tested during dental treatment, two outcomes assessing pain during and after injection of local anaesthetic, and 47 outcomes tested with a pulp tester or by pricking of gums or self‐reported by participants. \\nKey results \\nThe review suggests that of the 14 types of local anaesthetic tested, evidence to support the use of one over another is limited to the outcome of success (absence of pain), from three comparisons of local anaesthetic. Findings show that 4% articaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was superior to 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine in posterior teeth with inflamed pulps requiring root canal treatment. No difference between these solutions was seen when pain on injection was assessed, and although lidocaine resulted in less post‐injection pain, the difference was minimal. Researchers found that 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was superior to 3% prilocaine, 0.03 IU felypressin and 4% prilocaine plain for surgical procedures and surgical procedures/periodontal treatment, respectively. Speeds of onset were within clinically acceptable times, and durations were variable, making them suitable for different applications. Both of these latter outcomes were tested in experimental ways that may not reflect clinical findings. Unwanted effects were rare. Patients' experience of the procedures was not assessed owing to lack of data. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nFrom comparisons of local anaesthetics in this review, all appeared effective and safe with little difference between them. Available evidence ranged from moderate to very low in quality. Some studies fell short, in terms of quality, owing to small numbers of participants, unclear reporting of study methods, and reporting of data in a format that was not easy to combine with other data. Further research is required to clarify the effectiveness and safety of one local anaesthetic over another. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD010222.pub4': 'Anticoagulant treatment for subsegmental pulmonary embolism\\nBackground \\nAcute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cause of death, accounting for 50,000 to 200,000 deaths annually. It is the third most common cause of mortality among the cardiovascular diseases, after coronary artery disease and stroke. The advent of multi‐detector computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has allowed better assessment of PE regarding visualisation of the peripheral pulmonary arteries, increasing its rate of diagnosis. More cases of peripheral PEs, such as isolated subsegmental PE (SSPE) and incidental PE, have thereby been identified. These two conditions are usually found in patients with few or no classic symptoms such as coughing (including coughing up blood), chest or upper back pain, acute shortness of breath, or general or specific failure of the circulation that is either cardiac or peripheral in nature. However, in patients with an impaired cardiac and pulmonary condition the classic PE symptoms can be found with isolated SSPEs. Incidental SSPE is found casually in asymptomatic patients, usually by diagnostic imaging performed for other reasons (for example routine computed tomography (CT) for cancer staging in oncologic patients). Patients with isolated SSPE or incidental PE may have a more benign clinical presentation compared to those with proximal PEs. However, the clinical significance and prognosis in these patients has to be studied to evaluate whether anticoagulation therapy is required. \\nReview question \\nWhat is the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulation therapy versus control in patients with subsegmental pulmonary embolism (SSPE) or incidental SSPE? \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe did not identify any studies that met the inclusion criteria.\\nKey results \\nThere is no evidence from randomised controlled trials (current to 26 November 2019) on the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulation therapy versus control in patients with isolated subsegmental pulmonary embolism (SSPE) or incidental SSPE.

This review examines the efficacy and safety of the use of various Ayurvedic treatments for diabetes mellitus. We found seven trials which included 354 participants (172 on treatment, 158 on control, 24 could not be classified). All these studies included adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Six studies tested five different types of herbal mixtures (proprietary drugs) and only one tested 'whole system' Ayurvedic treatment. The duration of treatment ranged from three to six months. One study each of Diabecon, Inolter and Cogent DB (proprietary herbal mixtures) found significantly lower glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) levels at the end of the treatment period compared to controls. Two studies of Diabecon, and one study of Cogent DB (proprietary herbal mixtures) found significantly lower fasting blood sugar levels at the end of the study period in the treatment group. No deaths were observed in these trials and side effects did not differ significantly between intervention and control groups. One study of Pancreas tonic reported no significant change in health‐related quality of life. No study reported on or was designed to investigate diabetic complications, death from any cause and costs. Despite positive results in some studies, and absence of serious side effects, firm conclusions cannot be drawn due to weak methods and small number of participants in the evaluated studies. Further research is needed to assess the efficacy of these treatments. Ayurvedic physicians generally use a mixture of various herbs or proprietary preparations along with diet, exercise and mode of living. The treatments are usually individualised taking into account the balance of three 'doshas'. It is possible that the interventions in the trials analysed have not replicated actual Ayurvedic practice but only assessed some components individually. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD007492.pub2': \"Healthcare services for adults with an intellectual disability\\nBackground \\nAdults with an intellectual disability often have difficulty in receiving the healthcare they need. Compared to other adults who do not have an intellectual disability, they have poorer health and have more difficulty finding, getting to, and paying for healthcare. This happens for both physical and mental healthcare needs. \\nReview question \\nWe conducted a review of the literature to assess the effects of different ways to organise services. This is the first update of a previously published review. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe searched for all relevant studies until 4 September 2015. We found seven studies, six of which we identified previously and one retrieved for this update. All of the studies assessed the impact of the intervention on the mental health of persons with an intellectual disability; none considered the physical health.\\xa0Those studies used different interventions, including giving persons with an intellectual disability more health services, psychological support, and treating them at home, instead of at the hospital. Studies mainly looked at how the interventions helped the behavioural problems of those with an intellectual disability, how much burden they caused the care givers, and how much they cost. No study assessed adverse events. \\nKey results \\nCommunity‐based behaviour therapy might decrease behavioural problems. We are uncertain whether other interventions make any difference in reducing behavioural problems. There was limited evidence about how those interventions helped care givers to deal with the burden of caring for their relatives with an intellectual disability, or how much they might cost compared with the usual care already provided. \\nAuthors' conclusions \\nThere is little information on different ways to organise services for people with intellectual disabilities. Most studies focused on people who had intellectual disabilities and mental health problems.\\xa0There were no studies on people who had intellectual disabilities and physical problems. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD010613.pub2': 'Intensity of continuous renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury\\nWhat is the issue? \\nAcute kidney injury (AKI) is very common among patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU), it is associated with a high death rated and characterised by the rapid loss of the kidney function. Patients with AKI show increased levels of serum uraemic toxins (creatinine and urea), serum potassium and metabolic acids, accumulation of water and in the most cases a reduction in urine output. In this population these chemicals and fluid overload are related to increased rates of death. Theoretically, effective removal of toxins and excess water from the bloodstream might improve patient outcomes (such as mortality rate and recovery of kidney function). \\nContinuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a blood purification technique that enables removal of excess water and toxins. CRRT involves blood being diverted from the patient via a catheter (a hollow, flexible tube placed into a vein) through a filtering system which continuously and steadily removes excess water and toxins; purified blood is then returned to the patient via the catheter. Higher intensity CRRT improves the removal of toxins and excess water. The aim of this review was to investigate the effect of different intensities of CRRT (intensive or less intensive) on death, recovery of kidney function, and adverse events in people with AKI who are critically ill. \\nWhat did we do? \\nWe searched the literature up until February 2016 and identified six studies enrolling 3185 patients with AKI that were evaluated in this review. \\nWhat did we find? \\nSix randomised studies enrolling 3185 participants were included in our review. Compared to less intensive CRRT, intensive CRRT did not reduce the risk of death, improve the recovery of kidney function, or reduce the risk of adverse events (such as bleeding) in patients with AKI. Intensive CRRT was associated with an increased risk of low blood phosphate levels. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD004418.pub4': \"Initial antibiotic treatment for coverage of 'atypical' pathogens for community‐acquired pneumonia in hospitalized adults \\nPneumonia is a serious lung infection and is usually treated with antibiotics. Bacteria which cause community‐acquired pneumonia (CAP, pneumonia contracted outside healthcare settings) are traditionally divided into 'typical' and 'atypical', each dictating a different antibiotic treatment. Atypical bacteria include, Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae). The main 'typical' agent causing CAP is Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae). It is usually not possible to determine which of the many potential agents is the cause of CAP, so that antibiotic treatment is empirical, customarily covering both typical and atypical bacteria. While typical coverage is essential, the necessity of the atypical coverage has not been proven. In the previous version of this review we showed that there was no advantage to the atypical arm. Given the persisting inconsistency between current guidelines for treatment of pneumonia and the available evidence, we undertook to update this systematic review. \\nThis Cochrane review looked at trials comparing antibiotic regimens with atypical coverage to those without, limited to hospitalized adults with CAP. We included 28 trials, involving 5939 patients. For the regimens tested, no advantage was found for regimens covering atypical bacteria in the major outcomes tested ‐ mortality and clinical efficacy. There was no significant difference between the groups in the frequency of total adverse events, or those requiring discontinuation of treatment. However, gastrointestinal events were less common in the atypical arm. \\nThere are limitations to this review in that a single study compared the addition of the atypical antibiotic to a typical antibiotic, the major question in clinical practice; most compared a single atypical antibiotic to a single typical antibiotic. Seventeen of the 27 trials were open label, 21 of the 27 studies were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies of which all but one was conducted by the manufacturer of the atypical antibiotic. \\n\", '10.1002-14651858.CD009567.pub2': 'Treatments for high altitude (mountain) illness\\nBackground \\nAcute high altitude illness, also known as acute mountain sickness, may present with a variety of symptoms. It is caused by the decreasing level of oxygen at increasingly high altitudes; and it can be experienced when reaching a high altitude when travelling, hiking or climbing mountains or other elevated areas. People going to altitudes over 4000 metres, females, people younger than mid‐adulthood , and people with a history of migraine are at greater risk of suffering from altitude sickness. The most common symptoms are headache, loss of appetite , insomnia, and nausea. However, severe forms can include confusion, difficulty walking, progressive cough, shortness of breath, and even death. \\nReview question \\nWhat are the benefits and risks of different treatments for people suffering from high altitude illness? \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe included 13 studies with a total of 468 participants. Most studies included participants with mild or moderate forms of mountain sickness, and only one study included the severe neurological (disorder of the nervous system) form. Follow‐up was usually less than one day. We also identified two ongoing studies. \\nKey results \\nWe found studies evaluating the following interventions: simulated descent with a hyperbaric chamber (medical use of oxygen in a special chamber at greater than atmospheric pressure to increase the availability of oxygen in the body); oxygen; medicines: acetazolamide, dexamethasone, ibuprofen, paracetamol, gabapentin, sumatriptan, nitric oxide, and magnesium sulphate. None of the studies reported the effects of these interventions on all‐cause mortality. The report of complete relief from acute mountain sickness symptoms, and adverse events was infrequent. Studies related to simulated descent with the use of a hyperbaric chamber did not find additional benefits or harms related to this intervention (3 studies, 124 participants). In addition, studies related to administration of medicines found some benefits in terms of reduction of symptoms with the use of acetazolamide (2 studies, 25 participants), and dexamethasone (1 study, 35 participants), without an increase in side effects. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nThe quality of the evidence we found was low, and thus our certainty in the findings is limited. There was insufficient information on how the studies were conducted, and in some cases there was evidence of tampering at some stages of the trials. Furthermore, the number of persons in each study was very small (< 30 participants), and therefore the results were not clear (imprecise). Some studies were not blinded (that is, participants knew what experimental treatment they were receiving), and this could have affected how the participants evaluated their own symptoms. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD002201.pub6': 'The use of omega‐3 supplements in people with cystic fibrosis\\nReview question \\nWe reviewed the evidence about the effect of giving omega‐3 supplements to people with cystic fibrosis. \\nBackground \\nIn people with cystic fibrosis recurring cycles of infection and inflammation are thought to worsen lung function. Studies suggest that omega‐3 fatty acids, such as those derived from fish oils, may work to counter the inflammation and may be of benefit in chronic inflammatory diseases including cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of the review. \\nSearch date \\nThe evidence is current to: 01 April 2020.\\nStudy characteristics \\nThis review includes five small studies which compare omega‐3 supplements to a different supplement without omega‐3. In total there were 106 participants, including both children and adults. The studies lasted between six weeks and 12 months. \\nKey results \\nDue to the very low‐quality evidence, we are uncertain whether the following effects are due to supplementation or not. One 12‐month study reported a reduction in pulmonary exacerbations and antibiotic use when taking omega‐3 supplementation compared to placebo and one three‐month study reported no change in antibiotic use during the study period. Few side effects were reported in any of the studies. One six‐week study reported that lung function and clinical status improved when taking omega‐3 supplements. Sputum levels were also noted to be reduced in this six‐week study. Three studies reported no difference in lung function when taking omega‐3 supplementation compared to placebo. Two longer studies found that people taking omega‐3 supplements showed definite increases in levels of essential fatty acids in their white blood cell membranes and also in levels of phospholipids (molecules that provide structure and protection to cells) measured in blood samples. \\nWe are uncertain whether regular omega‐3 supplements benefit people with cystic fibrosis and whether they cause side effects, or not. We are not able to draw firm conclusions or recommend the routine use of these supplements in people with cystic fibrosis. Larger and longer studies are needed to assess the clinical benefit of omega‐3 supplementation and to determine the appropriate dosage. \\nQuality of the evidence \\nWe judged the quality of the evidence to be very low due to very low participant numbers, low event rates, limited reporting and poor study design. There was no consistency with regards to the time points when results were reported or the measurements used for the same outcome in different studies. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD008215.pub3': 'Is there an increased risk of ovarian cancer in women treated with drugs for subfertility?\\nBackground Drugs to stimulate ovulation have been used to treat subfertility since the early 1960s. There is uncertainty about the safety of these drugs and their potential risk of causing cancer. Moreover, it has already been shown that infertility itself increases the risk of ovarian cancer. \\nThe aim of the review We aimed with this updated systematic review to summarise current published research on the risk of ovarian cancer in subfertile women treated with fertility drugs compared to the general population and to subfertile women not treated with fertility drugs. \\nWhat are the main findings? Overall, based on 37 studies, which included a total of 4,684,724 women, we did not find enough strong evidence suggesting a potentially higher risk of ovarian cancer in women treated with fertility drugs. \\nA cumulative analysis of 12 case‐control studies from the USA revealed increased risk of ovarian cancer in women using fertility drugs, and this risk was higher in nulliparous women (women who have not given birth) when compared to multiparous women (women who have given birth to more than one child). One of the 37 included studies reported a two‐fold increase in development of serous borderline ovarian tumour in women after more than four cycles of progesterone; however the number of cases included in this group was very small. One cohort study also suggested an increased risk of borderline ovarian tumour in infertile women treated with clomiphene citrate when compared to infertile women who did not undergo treatment to conceive. \\nQuality of the evidence Studies showing an increase in the risk of ovarian cancer were of low methodological quality, with short follow‐up periods and with lack of adjustment for important confounding factors; therefore the results are too unreliable. However, compared with older studies, recent studies have tended to report both the dose and the number of cycles of infertility drugs and have included more contemporary drug regimens; this has made the final results more reliable. \\nWhat are the conclusions? Infertility has been found to be an important risk factor for ovarian cancer. However, the association between infertility drugs and ovarian cancer needs to be addressed with consideration of other factors such as age, body mass index, parity, genetic factors (i.e. family history for ovarian cancer), and aetiology of the infertility, along with longer follow‐up times. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD007176.pub2': 'Antioxidant supplements for prevention of mortality in healthy participants and patients with various diseases \\nPrevious research on animal and physiological models suggests that antioxidant supplements have beneficial effects that may prolong life. Some observational studies also suggest that antioxidant supplements may prolong life, whereas other observational studies demonstrate neutral or harmful effects. Our Cochrane review from 2008 demonstrated that antioxidant supplements seem to increase mortality. This review is now updated. \\nThe present systematic review included 78 randomised clinical trials. In total, 296,707 participants were randomised to antioxidant supplements (beta‐carotene, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium) versus placebo or no intervention. Twenty‐six trials included 215,900 healthy participants. Fifty‐two trials included 80,807 participants with various diseases in a stable phase (including gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, neurological, ocular, dermatological, rheumatoid, renal, endocrinological, or unspecified diseases). A total of 21,484 of 183,749 participants (11.7%) randomised to antioxidant supplements and 11,479 of 112,958 participants (10.2%) randomised to placebo or no intervention died. The trials appeared to have enough statistical similarity that they could be combined. When all of the trials were combined, antioxidants may or may not have increased mortality depending on which statistical combination method was employed; the analysis that is typically used when similarity is present demonstrated that antioxidant use did slightly increase mortality (that is, the patients consuming the antioxidants were 1.03 times as likely to die as were the controls). When analyses were done to identify factors that were associated with this finding, the two factors identified were better methodology to prevent bias from being a factor in the trial (trials with ‘low risk of bias’) and the use of vitamin A. In fact, when the trials with low risks of bias were considered separately, the increased mortality was even more pronounced (1.04 times as likely to die as were the controls). The potential damage from vitamin A disappeared when only the low risks of bias trials were considered. The increased risk of mortality was associated with beta‐carotene and possibly vitamin E and vitamin A, but was not associated with the use of vitamin C or selenium. The current evidence does not support the use of antioxidant supplements in the general population or in patients with various diseases. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD010461.pub3': 'Advanced sperm selection techniques for assisted reproduction\\nReview question \\nWe sought to determine if any advanced sperm selection techniques used for assisted reproduction, except for ultra‐high magnification, alter the rates of live birth, clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, or foetal abnormalities. \\nBackground \\nIn vitro fertilisation (IVF) with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is a commonly used treatment for subfertile couples. It is thought that the selection of high‐quality sperm may improve outcomes for these couples. Advanced sperm selection techniques use complex methods to select healthy, mature, and structurally sound sperm for fertilisation. Despite the use of these techniques in many centres worldwide, their effectiveness is unclear. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe included eight randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) with a total of 4147 women. Four studies evaluated sperm selection by their ability to bind to hyaluronic acid during the ICSI process (HA‐ICSI) against ICSI. One study compared HA‐ICSI versus SpermSlow. One study compared HA‐ICSI versus magnetic‐activated cell sorting (MACS) versus ICSI. Three studies compared MACS versus ICSI. One study compared sperm selection by surface charge Zeta potential versus ICSI. Six of the included studies reported rates of live birth; seven reported clinical pregnancy; six reported miscarriage per clinical pregnancy and per woman randomly assigned; and none reported on foetal abnormalities. \\nKey results \\nThe current evidence suggests that advanced sperm selection strategies in assisted reproductive technologist (ART) may not result in an increase in the likelihood of live birth. The only sperm selection technique that potentially increases live birth and clinical pregnancy rates is Zeta sperm selection, yet these results were of very low quality and derived from a single study, therefore we are uncertain of the effect. There is low‐quality evidence that HA‐ICSI decreases miscarriage rates when compared with ICSI. We are uncertain whether the other sperm selection techniques alter clinical pregnancy or miscarriage rates. No studies reported on foetal abnormalities, and further studies of suitable quality are required before any of these advanced sperm selection techniques can be recommended for use in clinical practice. \\nEvidence quality \\nThe evidence gathered was of very low to low quality. The main limitations were imprecision associated with low numbers of participants or events and high risk of performance bias. Data on important clinical outcomes such as foetal abnormalities were absent. \\n', '10.1002-14651858.CD007920.pub3': \"Anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor for neovascular glaucoma\\nWhat was the aim of this review? To compare treatment with and without anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor (anti‐VEGF) medications for people with neovascular glaucoma (NVG). \\nKey message It is uncertain whether treatment with anti‐VEGF medications is more beneficial than treatment without anti‐VEGF medications for people with NVG. More research is needed to investigate the long‐term effect of anti‐VEGF medications compared with, or in addition to, conventional treatment. \\nWhat did we study in this review? VEGF is a protein produced by cells in your body, and produces new blood vessels when needed. When cells produce too much VEGF, abnormal blood vessels can grow in the eye. NVG is a type of glaucoma where the angle between the iris (coloured part of the eye) and the cornea (transparent front part of the eye) is closed by new blood vessels growing in the eye, hence, the name 'neovascular'. New blood vessels can cause scarring and narrowing, which can eventually lead to complete closure of the angle. This results in increased eye pressure since the fluid in the eye cannot drain properly. In NVG, the eye is often red and painful, and the vision is abnormal. High pressure in the eye can lead to blindness. \\nAnti‐VEGF medication is a type of medicine that blocks VEGF, therefore, slowing the growth of blood vessels. It is administered by injection into the eye. It can be used early stage, when conventional treatment may not be possible. Most studies report short‐term (generally four to six weeks) benefits of anti‐VEGF medication, but long‐term benefits are not clear. \\nWhat were the main results of this review? We included four studies enrolling a total of 263 participants with NVG. In one study, results beyond the treatment period of 1 week could not be evaluated. In another study, results were uncertain due to the limitation of study design. \\nThe last two studies reported different results for lowering eye pressure; one study showed inconclusive results, and the other study showed that anti‐VEGF medications were more effective. The certainty of the evidence in these studies was low, due to limitations in the study designs and inconsistency of results. Therefore, available evidence is insufficient to recommend the routine use of anti‐VEGF medication in individuals with NVG. \\nHow up to date is the review?

Perineal trauma can occur spontaneously or result from a surgical incision (episiotomy). Different perineal techniques are being used to slow down the birth of the baby's head, and allow the perineum to stretch slowly to prevent injury. Massage, warm compresses and different perineal management techniques are widely used by midwives and birth attendants. The objective of this updated review was to assess the effect of perineal techniques during the second stage of labour on the incidence of perineal trauma. This is an update of a review that was published in 2011. \\nWhy is this important? \\nTrauma to the perineum can cause pain and other problems for women after the birth. The damage is described as first‐, second‐, third‐ and fourth‐degree tears – first‐degree tears being the least damage and fourth‐degree tears being the most. Third‐ and fourth‐degree tears, affect the anal sphincter or mucosa, thus causing the most problems. Reducing the use of episiotomies will reduce trauma to the perineum. Also, different perineal techniques are being used to slow down the birth of the baby's head. Massage, warm compresses and different perineal management techniques are widely used by midwives and birth attendants. It is important to know if these do indeed reduce trauma and pain for women. \\nWhat evidence did we find? \\nWe searched for studies in September 2016. Twenty two trials were eligible for inclusion in this updated review but only twenty studies (involving 15,181 women), contributed results to the review. The participants in the studies were women without medical complications who were expecting a vaginal birth. The studies varied in their risk of bias, and the quality of the studies was very low to moderate. \\nHands off (or poised) compared to hands on  \\nUsing 'hands off' the perineum resulted in fewer women having an episiotomy (low‐quality evidence), but made no difference to numbers of women with no tears (moderate‐quality evidence), first‐degree tears (low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (low‐quality evidence), or third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence). There were considerable unexplained differences in results between the four studies. None of the studies provided data on the number of tears requiring suturing. \\nWarm compresses versus control (hands off or no warm compress)  \\nFewer women in the warm‐compress group experienced third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (moderate‐quality evidence). A warm compress did not affect numbers of women with intact perineum (moderate‐quality evidence), tears requiring suturing (very low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), or episiotomies (low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether warm compresses increase or reduce the incidence of first‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence). \\nMassage versus control (hands off or routine care)  \\nThere were more women with an intact perineum in the perineal massage group (low‐quality evidence), and fewer women with third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (moderate‐quality evidence). Massage did not appear to make a difference to women with perineal trauma requiring suturing (very low‐quality evidence), first‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), or episiotomies (very low‐quality evidence). \\nRitgen's manoeuvre versus standard care  \\nOne small study found that women who had Ritgen's manoeuvre had fewer first‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), but more second‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence). There was no difference between groups in terms of the number of third‐ or fourth‐degree tears, or episiotomies (both low‐quality evidence). \\nWhat does this mean? \\nWe found that massage and warm compresses may reduce serious perineal trauma (third‐ and fourth‐degree tears). Hands‐off techniques may reduce the number of episiotomies but it was not clear that these techniques had a beneficial effect on other perineal trauma. There remains uncertainty about the value of other techniques to reduce damage to the perineum during childbirth. \\nMore research is necessary, to evaluate different perineal techniques and to answer questions about how to minimise perineal trauma. There is insufficient evidence on women's experiences and views (only one included study collected information on this). It is important for future research to ascertain whether these interventions are acceptable to women. \\n\"}\n"

Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant side effects. Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug that is used to treat active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. This review includes seven randomized trials with a total of 495 participants. There is evidence from one large study which suggests that methotrexate (25 mg/week) injected intramuscularly for 16 weeks among patients with active treatment resistant Crohn's disease may provide a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids. This reduction in steroid use could reduce steroid\\u2010induced side effects for people with chronic Crohn's disease. Although side effects are more common with high dose methotrexate therapy, no serious side effects have been observed. Common side effects associated with methotrexate therapy include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash and headache. Studies comparing lower dose oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) to placebo (e.g. sugar pill) or other active drugs (e.g. azathioprine or 6\\u2010mercaptopurine) indicate that lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any benefit for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. However, these trials were small in size and further studies of oral methotrexate may be justified. Two studies looked at the combination of methotrexate and infliximab (a biological drug) compared to infliximab therapy alone. These studies indicated that the addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infiximab. However these studies were relatively small and further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies. \\n\",\n          \"Background\\nCataract surgery is the most common incisional surgical procedure in ophthalmology and is important in ophthalmic graduate medical education. Although most ophthalmology training programs in the United States (US) include virtual reality (VR) training for cataract surgery, comprehensive reviews that detail the impact of VR training on ophthalmology trainee performance are lacking. \\nObjectives\\nTo assess the impact of VR training for cataract surgery on the operating performance of postgraduate ophthalmology trainees, measured by operating time, intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, supervising physician ratings, and VR simulator task ratings. \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase.com, PubMed, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 14 June 2021. \\nSelection criteria\\nWe included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing VR training to any other method of training, including non\\u2010VR simulation training (e.g., wet laboratory training), didactics training, or no supplementary training in postgraduate ophthalmology trainees. \\nData collection and analysis\\nWe used standard Cochrane methodology. Primary outcomes were operating times in the operating room and intraoperative complications. Secondary outcomes were operating times in simulated settings, simulator task ratings, and supervising physician ratings, either in the operating room or simulated settings. \\nMain results\\nWe included six RCTs with a total of 151 postgraduate ophthalmology trainees ranging from 12 to 60 participants in each study. The included studies varied widely in terms of geography: two in the US, and one study each in China, Germany, India, and Morocco. Three studies compared VR training for phacoemulsification cataract surgery on the Eyesi simulator (VRmagic, Mannheim, Germany) with wet laboratory training and two studies compared VR training with no supplementary training. One study compared trainees who received VR training with those who received conventional training for manual small incision cataract surgery on the HelpMeSee simulator (HelpMeSee, New York, NY). Industry financially supported two studies. All studies had at least three domains judged at high or unclear risks of bias. We did not conduct a meta\\u2010analysis due to insufficient data (i.e., lack of precision measurements, or studies reported only P values). All evidence was very low\\u2010certainty, meaning that any estimates were unreliable. \\nThe evidence for the benefits of VR training for trainees was very uncertain for primary outcomes. VR\\u2010trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had shorter operating times (mean difference [MD] \\u221217 minutes, 95% confidence interval [CI] \\u221221.62 to \\u221212.38; 1 study, n = 12; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). Results for operating time were inconsistent when comparing VR and wet laboratory\\u00a0training: one study found that VR relative to wet laboratory training was associated with longer operating times (P = 0.038); the other reported that two training groups had similar operating times (P = 0.14).\\u00a0One study reported that VR\\u2010trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had fewer intraoperative complications (P < 0.001); in another study, VR and conventionally trained trainees had similar intraoperative complication rates (MD \\u22128.31, 95% CI \\u221222.78 to 6.16; 1 study, n = 19; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). \\nFor secondary outcomes, VR training may have similar impact on trainee performance compared to wet laboratory\\u00a0and greater\\u00a0impact compared to no supplementary training, but the evidence was very uncertain. One study reported VR\\u2010trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had significantly reduced operating time in simulated settings (P = 0.0013). Another study reported that VR\\u2010trained relative to wet laboratory\\u2010trained trainees had shorter operating times in VR settings (MD \\u22121.40 minutes, 95% CI \\u22121.96 to \\u22120.84; 1 study, n = 60) and similar times in wet laboratory settings (MD 0.16 minutes, 95% CI \\u22120.50 to 0.82; 1 study, n = 60). This study also found the VR\\u2010trained trainees had higher VR simulator ratings (MD 5.17, 95% CI 0.61 to 9.73; 1 study, n = 60). Results for supervising physician ratings in the operating room were inconsistent: one study reported that VR\\u2010 and wet laboratory\\u2010trained trainees received similar supervising physician ratings for cataract surgery (P = 0.608); another study reported that VR\\u2010trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training were less likely to receive poor ratings by supervising physicians for capsulorhexis construction (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.57). In wet laboratory settings, VR\\u2010trained trainees received similar supervising physician ratings compared with wet laboratory\\u2010trained trainees (MD \\u22121.50, 95% CI \\u22126.77 to 3.77; n = 60) and higher supervising physician ratings compared with trainees without supplementary training (P < 0.0001). However, the results for all secondary outcomes should be interpreted with caution because of very low\\u2010certainty evidence.\\u00a0 \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nCurrent research suggests that VR training may be more effective than no supplementary training in improving trainee performance in the operating room and simulated settings for postgraduate ophthalmology trainees, but the evidence is uncertain. The evidence comparing VR with conventional or wet laboratory training was less consistent. \\n\",\n          \"Background\\nVitamin D deficiency during pregnancy increases the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and low birthweight. In a previous Cochrane Review we found that supplementing pregnant women with vitamin D alone compared to no vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and low birthweight and may increase the risk of preterm births if it is combined with calcium. However the effects of different vitamin D regimens are not yet clear. \\nObjectives\\nTo assess the effects and safety of different regimens of vitamin D supplementation alone or in combination with calcium or other vitamins, minerals or nutrients during pregnancy, specifically doses of 601 international units per day (IU/d) or more versus 600 IU/d or less; and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less. \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth\\u2019s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (12 July 2018), and the reference lists of retrieved studies. \\nSelection criteria\\nRandomised trials evaluating the effect of different vitamin D regimens (dose, frequency, duration, and time of commencement of supplementation during pregnancy), alone or in combination with other nutrients on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes. We only included trials that compared 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less. We did not include in the analysis groups that received no vitamin D, as that comparison is assessed in another Cochrane Review. \\nData collection and analysis\\nTwo review authors independently: i) assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria; ii) extracted data from included studies, and iii) assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. Our primary maternal outcomes were: pre\\u2010eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and any adverse effects; our primary infant outcomes were preterm birth and low birthweight. Data were checked for accuracy. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. \\nMain results\\nIn this review, we included data from 30 trials involving 7289 women. We excluded 11 trials, identified 16 ongoing/unpublished trials and two trials are awaiting classification. Overall risk of bias for the trials was mixed. \\nComparison 1. 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less of vitamin D alone or with any other nutrient (19 trials; 5214 participants) \\nSupplementation with 601 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia (risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.42); 5 trials; 1553 participants,low\\u2010certainty evidence), may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.86; 5 trials; 1846 participants; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence), may make little or no difference to the risk of preterm birth (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.69; 4 trials; 2294 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence); and may make little or no difference to the risk of low birthweight (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.24; 4 trials; 1550 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) compared to women receiving 600 IU/d or less. \\nComparison 2. 4000 IU or more versus 3999 IU or less of vitamin D alone (15 trials; 4763 participants) \\nSupplementation with 4000 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of: pre\\u2010eclampsia (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.22; 4 trials, 1903 participants, low\\u2010certainty evidence); gestational diabetes (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.42; 5 trials, 2276 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence); preterm birth (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.12; 6 trials, 2948 participants, low\\u2010certainty evidence); and low birthweight (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.70; 2 trials; 1099 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence) compared to women receiving 3999 IU/d or less. \\nAdverse events (such as hypercalcaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypercalciuria, and hypovitaminosis D) were reported differently in most trials; however, in general, there was little to no side effects reported or similar cases between groups. \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nSupplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes; however, it may make little or no difference to the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, preterm birth and low birthweight. Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current upper limit for vitamin D seems not to increase the risk of the outcomes evaluated. In general, the GRADE was considered low certainty for most of the primary outcomes due to serious risk of bias and imprecision of results. With respect to safety, it appears that vitamin D supplementation is a safe intervention during pregnancy, although the parameters used to determine this were either not reported or not consistent between trials. Future trials should be consistent in their reports of adverse events. There are 16 ongoing trials that when published, will increase the body of knowledge. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"simplified_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"## Plain Title\\nStudy on a Drug for Crohn's Disease\\n\\n## Rationale\\nCrohn's disease makes the gut swell.

The study wanted to see if methotrexate could help. It aimed to help patients feel better. It also aimed to help them stop using steroids.\\n\\n## Trial Design\\nThis study looked at other studies. It gathered facts from seven past trials. These trials had 495 people in total. The people in these studies had Crohn's disease. Their disease was still active. Other drugs had not worked well for them.\\n\\nOne main study looked at methotrexate. Patients got a shot of methotrexate. They got 25 mg each week. This went on for 16 weeks. The goal was to see if they got better. It also looked if they could stop steroids.\\n\\nOther studies looked at methotrexate pills. They used a lower dose. Patients took 12.5 to 15 mg each week. Some got a fake pill. Some got other drugs. These studies were small.\\n\\nSome studies looked at methotrexate with another drug. This drug is called infliximab. They checked if adding methotrexate helped more.\\n\\n## Results\\nOne large study showed good results. Methotrexate shots helped patients feel better. It helped them stop taking steroids. This means fewer bad problems from steroids. Patients with Crohn's disease could live better lives.\\n\\nThis study used 25 mg of methotrexate weekly. Patients got a shot. This went on for 16 weeks. It helped them get better. It also helped them stop steroids. This is a big help. It means fewer side effects from steroids.\\n\\nMethotrexate can have side effects. These include feeling sick to your stomach. You might throw up. You might have tummy pain. Diarrhea and skin rash can also happen. Headaches are also possible. But no serious problems were seen in this study.\\n\\nLower doses of methotrexate pills did not work as well. This was based on smaller studies. More study is needed for methotrexate pills.\\n\\nAdding methotrexate to infliximab did not seem to help more. This was in small studies. More research is needed for this.\\n\\nThe study showed methotrexate shots can help. It helps people with active Crohn's disease. It helps them feel better. It also lowers steroid use.

New doctors need to learn how to do the surgery well and safely. Many training programs use special virtual reality (VR) tools to help. VR training lets doctors practice without real patients.\\n\\nWe wanted to see if VR training truly helps new eye doctors perform better. We looked at how fast they did surgery and if they had fewer problems. We also checked what their teachers thought of their skills. We think VR training could be a good way to teach new doctors. It gives them a safe place to learn and get better.\\n\\n### Trial Design\\n\\nThis study looked at how different studies were set up. It was a review of studies where people were put into groups by chance. This is called a \\\"randomized controlled trial.\\\"\\n\\nThese studies looked at new eye doctors after medical school. They were learning to do cataract surgery. The studies compared VR training to other ways of learning. This included practicing on models, learning from books, or having no extra training.\\n\\nDoctors in these studies ranged in age, but no specific ages were given. Both male and female doctors were included. The studies came from different parts of the world. We looked at how long it took doctors to do surgery and if they had problems during or after surgery. Teachers also rated their skills. The time a person was in any one study varied.\\n\\n### Results\\n\\nWe looked at six studies that included 151 new eye doctors. These doctors were training to do cataract surgery. The studies came from different countries like the US, China, and Germany.\\n\\nSome studies compared VR training to practicing on models. Other studies compared VR training to no extra training.\\n\\nThe results were not always clear. It was hard to be sure about the benefits of VR training. This is because the studies were set up in different ways.\\n\\nOne study showed that doctors with VR training, compared to those with no extra training, did surgery faster. They took about 17 minutes less. One study also found that doctors with VR training had fewer problems during surgery.\\n\\nWhen comparing VR training to practicing on models, the results were mixed. Some studies found similar times for both groups. One study even found VR training took longer.\\n\\nFor practice in a VR setting, doctors with VR training did surgery faster than those with no extra training. They also did better on VR tasks.\\n\\nTeachers' ratings of doctors in real surgery were not always clear. Some studies found similar ratings for VR training and model practice. One study found that teachers gave better ratings to VR-trained doctors compared to those with no extra training.\\n\\nOverall, the studies suggest that VR training might help new eye doctors. It might make them faster and have fewer problems, especially when compared to no extra training. But we need more clear studies to be sure.\",\n          \"## Plain Language Summary\\n\\n### Plain Title\\nVitamin D for Pregnant Women: How Much is Best?\\n\\n### Rationale\\nDuring pregnancy, some women do not have enough vitamin D. This is called vitamin D deficiency. This can lead to serious health problems for both mom and baby. These problems include:\\n\\n*   **Pre-eclampsia:** This is high blood pressure during pregnancy. It can harm the mother and baby.\\n*   **Gestational diabetes:** This is high blood sugar that starts during pregnancy.\\n*   **Preterm birth:** This is when a baby is born too early.\\n*   **Low birthweight:** This is when a baby weighs too little at birth.\\n\\nWe know that taking vitamin D may help reduce some of these risks. But we are not sure what amount of vitamin D is best. We also want to know if certain amounts are safe. This study looked at different amounts of vitamin D. It compared them to see what worked best and was safest.\\n\\n### Trial Design\\nThis study was a large review of many other studies. It gathered information from 30 studies. These studies included 7,289 pregnant women. All women in these studies took some amount of vitamin D. Some women also took calcium or other vitamins.\\n\\nWe looked at two main things:\\n1.  Did taking more than 600 units of vitamin D each day make a difference?\\n2.  Did taking more than 3,999 units of vitamin D each day make a difference?\\n\\nWe wanted to see how these amounts affected pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and low birthweight. We also looked for any bad side effects. The studies lasted for the full term of the pregnancy.\\n\\n### Results\\nWe found some important things:\\n\\n**Taking more than 600 units of vitamin D each day:**\\n*   It may help lower the risk of gestational diabetes. This is a good benefit for moms.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of pre-eclampsia.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of preterm birth.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of low birthweight.\\n\\n**Taking more than 3,999 units of vitamin D each day:**\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of pre-eclampsia.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of gestational diabetes.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of preterm birth.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of low birthweight.\\n\\nOverall, vitamin D seems safe for pregnant women. There were few or no bad side effects reported. When side effects did happen, they were similar in all groups.\\n\\n**What we learned:**\\nTaking more vitamin D than what is usually suggested may lower the risk of gestational diabetes. But it did not seem to help with other problems like pre-eclampsia or early birth. Even taking high amounts of vitamin D did not seem to cause more problems. More studies are ongoing. They will give us more clear answers in the future.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pls_text_content\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Methotrexate for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease\\nAlthough corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission of Crohn's disease, many patients relapse when steroids are withdrawn or become steroid dependent. Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant side effects. Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug that is used to treat active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. This review includes seven randomized trials with a total of 495 participants. There is evidence from one large study which suggests that methotrexate (25 mg/week) injected intramuscularly for 16 weeks among patients with active treatment resistant Crohn's disease may provide a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids. This reduction in steroid use could reduce steroid\\u2010induced side effects for people with chronic Crohn's disease. Although side effects are more common with high dose methotrexate therapy, no serious side effects have been observed. Common side effects associated with methotrexate therapy include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash and headache. Studies comparing lower dose oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) to placebo (e.g. sugar pill) or other active drugs (e.g. azathioprine or 6\\u2010mercaptopurine) indicate that lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any benefit for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. However, these trials were small in size and further studies of oral methotrexate may be justified. Two studies looked at the combination of methotrexate and infliximab (a biological drug) compared to infliximab therapy alone. These studies indicated that the addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infiximab. However these studies were relatively small and further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant side effects. Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug that is used to treat active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. This review includes seven randomized trials with a total of 495 participants. There is evidence from one large study which suggests that methotrexate (25 mg/week) injected intramuscularly for 16 weeks among patients with active treatment resistant Crohn's disease may provide a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids. This reduction in steroid use could reduce steroid\\u2010induced side effects for people with chronic Crohn's disease. Although side effects are more common with high dose methotrexate therapy, no serious side effects have been observed. Common side effects associated with methotrexate therapy include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash and headache. Studies comparing lower dose oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) to placebo (e.g. sugar pill) or other active drugs (e.g. azathioprine or 6\\u2010mercaptopurine) indicate that lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any benefit for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. However, these trials were small in size and further studies of oral methotrexate may be justified. Two studies looked at the combination of methotrexate and infliximab (a biological drug) compared to infliximab therapy alone. These studies indicated that the addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infiximab. However these studies were relatively small and further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies. \\n\",\n          \"Background\\nCataract surgery is the most common incisional surgical procedure in ophthalmology and is important in ophthalmic graduate medical education. Although most ophthalmology training programs in the United States (US) include virtual reality (VR) training for cataract surgery, comprehensive reviews that detail the impact of VR training on ophthalmology trainee performance are lacking. \\nObjectives\\nTo assess the impact of VR training for cataract surgery on the operating performance of postgraduate ophthalmology trainees, measured by operating time, intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, supervising physician ratings, and VR simulator task ratings. \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase.com, PubMed, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 14 June 2021. \\nSelection criteria\\nWe included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing VR training to any other method of training, including non\\u2010VR simulation training (e.g., wet laboratory training), didactics training, or no supplementary training in postgraduate ophthalmology trainees. \\nData collection and analysis\\nWe used standard Cochrane methodology. Primary outcomes were operating times in the operating room and intraoperative complications. Secondary outcomes were operating times in simulated settings, simulator task ratings, and supervising physician ratings, either in the operating room or simulated settings. \\nMain results\\nWe included six RCTs with a total of 151 postgraduate ophthalmology trainees ranging from 12 to 60 participants in each study. The included studies varied widely in terms of geography: two in the US, and one study each in China, Germany, India, and Morocco. Three studies compared VR training for phacoemulsification cataract surgery on the Eyesi simulator (VRmagic, Mannheim, Germany) with wet laboratory training and two studies compared VR training with no supplementary training. One study compared trainees who received VR training with those who received conventional training for manual small incision cataract surgery on the HelpMeSee simulator (HelpMeSee, New York, NY). Industry financially supported two studies. All studies had at least three domains judged at high or unclear risks of bias. We did not conduct a meta\\u2010analysis due to insufficient data (i.e., lack of precision measurements, or studies reported only P values). All evidence was very low\\u2010certainty, meaning that any estimates were unreliable. \\nThe evidence for the benefits of VR training for trainees was very uncertain for primary outcomes. VR\\u2010trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had shorter operating times (mean difference [MD] \\u221217 minutes, 95% confidence interval [CI] \\u221221.62 to \\u221212.38; 1 study, n = 12; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). Results for operating time were inconsistent when comparing VR and wet laboratory\\u00a0training: one study found that VR relative to wet laboratory training was associated with longer operating times (P = 0.038); the other reported that two training groups had similar operating times (P = 0.14).\\u00a0One study reported that VR\\u2010trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had fewer intraoperative complications (P < 0.001); in another study, VR and conventionally trained trainees had similar intraoperative complication rates (MD \\u22128.31, 95% CI \\u221222.78 to 6.16; 1 study, n = 19; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). \\nFor secondary outcomes, VR training may have similar impact on trainee performance compared to wet laboratory\\u00a0and greater\\u00a0impact compared to no supplementary training, but the evidence was very uncertain. One study reported VR\\u2010trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had significantly reduced operating time in simulated settings (P = 0.0013). Another study reported that VR\\u2010trained relative to wet laboratory\\u2010trained trainees had shorter operating times in VR settings (MD \\u22121.40 minutes, 95% CI \\u22121.96 to \\u22120.84; 1 study, n = 60) and similar times in wet laboratory settings (MD 0.16 minutes, 95% CI \\u22120.50 to 0.82; 1 study, n = 60). This study also found the VR\\u2010trained trainees had higher VR simulator ratings (MD 5.17, 95% CI 0.61 to 9.73; 1 study, n = 60). Results for supervising physician ratings in the operating room were inconsistent: one study reported that VR\\u2010 and wet laboratory\\u2010trained trainees received similar supervising physician ratings for cataract surgery (P = 0.608); another study reported that VR\\u2010trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training were less likely to receive poor ratings by supervising physicians for capsulorhexis construction (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.57). In wet laboratory settings, VR\\u2010trained trainees received similar supervising physician ratings compared with wet laboratory\\u2010trained trainees (MD \\u22121.50, 95% CI \\u22126.77 to 3.77; n = 60) and higher supervising physician ratings compared with trainees without supplementary training (P < 0.0001). However, the results for all secondary outcomes should be interpreted with caution because of very low\\u2010certainty evidence.\\u00a0 \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nCurrent research suggests that VR training may be more effective than no supplementary training in improving trainee performance in the operating room and simulated settings for postgraduate ophthalmology trainees, but the evidence is uncertain. The evidence comparing VR with conventional or wet laboratory training was less consistent. \\n\",\n          \"Background\\nVitamin D deficiency during pregnancy increases the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and low birthweight. In a previous Cochrane Review we found that supplementing pregnant women with vitamin D alone compared to no vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and low birthweight and may increase the risk of preterm births if it is combined with calcium. However the effects of different vitamin D regimens are not yet clear. \\nObjectives\\nTo assess the effects and safety of different regimens of vitamin D supplementation alone or in combination with calcium or other vitamins, minerals or nutrients during pregnancy, specifically doses of 601 international units per day (IU/d) or more versus 600 IU/d or less; and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less. \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth\\u2019s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (12 July 2018), and the reference lists of retrieved studies. \\nSelection criteria\\nRandomised trials evaluating the effect of different vitamin D regimens (dose, frequency, duration, and time of commencement of supplementation during pregnancy), alone or in combination with other nutrients on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes. We only included trials that compared 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less. We did not include in the analysis groups that received no vitamin D, as that comparison is assessed in another Cochrane Review. \\nData collection and analysis\\nTwo review authors independently: i) assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria; ii) extracted data from included studies, and iii) assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. Our primary maternal outcomes were: pre\\u2010eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and any adverse effects; our primary infant outcomes were preterm birth and low birthweight. Data were checked for accuracy. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. \\nMain results\\nIn this review, we included data from 30 trials involving 7289 women. We excluded 11 trials, identified 16 ongoing/unpublished trials and two trials are awaiting classification. Overall risk of bias for the trials was mixed. \\nComparison 1. 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less of vitamin D alone or with any other nutrient (19 trials; 5214 participants) \\nSupplementation with 601 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia (risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.42); 5 trials; 1553 participants,low\\u2010certainty evidence), may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.86; 5 trials; 1846 participants; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence), may make little or no difference to the risk of preterm birth (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.69; 4 trials; 2294 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence); and may make little or no difference to the risk of low birthweight (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.24; 4 trials; 1550 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) compared to women receiving 600 IU/d or less. \\nComparison 2. 4000 IU or more versus 3999 IU or less of vitamin D alone (15 trials; 4763 participants) \\nSupplementation with 4000 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of: pre\\u2010eclampsia (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.22; 4 trials, 1903 participants, low\\u2010certainty evidence); gestational diabetes (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.42; 5 trials, 2276 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence); preterm birth (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.12; 6 trials, 2948 participants, low\\u2010certainty evidence); and low birthweight (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.70; 2 trials; 1099 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence) compared to women receiving 3999 IU/d or less. \\nAdverse events (such as hypercalcaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypercalciuria, and hypovitaminosis D) were reported differently in most trials; however, in general, there was little to no side effects reported or similar cases between groups. \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nSupplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes; however, it may make little or no difference to the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, preterm birth and low birthweight. Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current upper limit for vitamin D seems not to increase the risk of the outcomes evaluated. In general, the GRADE was considered low certainty for most of the primary outcomes due to serious risk of bias and imprecision of results. With respect to safety, it appears that vitamin D supplementation is a safe intervention during pregnancy, although the parameters used to determine this were either not reported or not consistent between trials. Future trials should be consistent in their reports of adverse events. There are 16 ongoing trials that when published, will increase the body of knowledge. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"simplified_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"## Plain Title\\nStudy on a Drug for Crohn's Disease\\n\\n## Rationale\\nCrohn's disease makes the gut swell. This can cause much pain. It makes life hard for patients. Doctors often give strong drugs called steroids. Steroids help at first. But many patients get sick again. They need more steroids. Too many steroids cause bad problems.\\n\\nThis study looked at a drug called methotrexate. This drug calms the body's defense system. It may help people with Crohn's disease. The study wanted to see if methotrexate could help. It aimed to help patients feel better. It also aimed to help them stop using steroids.\\n\\n## Trial Design\\nThis study looked at other studies. It gathered facts from seven past trials. These trials had 495 people in total. The people in these studies had Crohn's disease. Their disease was still active. Other drugs had not worked well for them.\\n\\nOne main study looked at methotrexate. Patients got a shot of methotrexate. They got 25 mg each week. This went on for 16 weeks. The goal was to see if they got better. It also looked if they could stop steroids.\\n\\nOther studies looked at methotrexate pills. They used a lower dose. Patients took 12.5 to 15 mg each week. Some got a fake pill. Some got other drugs. These studies were small.\\n\\nSome studies looked at methotrexate with another drug. This drug is called infliximab. They checked if adding methotrexate helped more.\\n\\n## Results\\nOne large study showed good results. Methotrexate shots helped patients feel better. It helped them stop taking steroids. This means fewer bad problems from steroids. Patients with Crohn's disease could live better lives.\\n\\nThis study used 25 mg of methotrexate weekly. Patients got a shot. This went on for 16 weeks. It helped them get better. It also helped them stop steroids. This is a big help. It means fewer side effects from steroids.\\n\\nMethotrexate can have side effects. These include feeling sick to your stomach. You might throw up. You might have tummy pain. Diarrhea and skin rash can also happen. Headaches are also possible. But no serious problems were seen in this study.\\n\\nLower doses of methotrexate pills did not work as well. This was based on smaller studies. More study is needed for methotrexate pills.\\n\\nAdding methotrexate to infliximab did not seem to help more. This was in small studies. More research is needed for this.\\n\\nThe study showed methotrexate shots can help. It helps people with active Crohn's disease. It helps them feel better. It also lowers steroid use. This is good news for many patients.\",\n          \"Here is a Plain Language Summary of the provided abstract:\\n\\n## How Virtual Reality Training Helps Eye Doctors Learn Surgery\\n\\n### Rationale\\n\\nEye doctors often do a surgery called cataract surgery. This surgery helps people see better when their eye lens gets cloudy. Learning this surgery is a big part of training for new eye doctors.\\n\\nThis training is very important. New doctors need to learn how to do the surgery well and safely. Many training programs use special virtual reality (VR) tools to help. VR training lets doctors practice without real patients.\\n\\nWe wanted to see if VR training truly helps new eye doctors perform better. We looked at how fast they did surgery and if they had fewer problems. We also checked what their teachers thought of their skills. We think VR training could be a good way to teach new doctors. It gives them a safe place to learn and get better.\\n\\n### Trial Design\\n\\nThis study looked at how different studies were set up. It was a review of studies where people were put into groups by chance. This is called a \\\"randomized controlled trial.\\\"\\n\\nThese studies looked at new eye doctors after medical school. They were learning to do cataract surgery. The studies compared VR training to other ways of learning. This included practicing on models, learning from books, or having no extra training.\\n\\nDoctors in these studies ranged in age, but no specific ages were given. Both male and female doctors were included. The studies came from different parts of the world. We looked at how long it took doctors to do surgery and if they had problems during or after surgery. Teachers also rated their skills. The time a person was in any one study varied.\\n\\n### Results\\n\\nWe looked at six studies that included 151 new eye doctors. These doctors were training to do cataract surgery. The studies came from different countries like the US, China, and Germany.\\n\\nSome studies compared VR training to practicing on models. Other studies compared VR training to no extra training.\\n\\nThe results were not always clear. It was hard to be sure about the benefits of VR training. This is because the studies were set up in different ways.\\n\\nOne study showed that doctors with VR training, compared to those with no extra training, did surgery faster. They took about 17 minutes less. One study also found that doctors with VR training had fewer problems during surgery.\\n\\nWhen comparing VR training to practicing on models, the results were mixed. Some studies found similar times for both groups. One study even found VR training took longer.\\n\\nFor practice in a VR setting, doctors with VR training did surgery faster than those with no extra training. They also did better on VR tasks.\\n\\nTeachers' ratings of doctors in real surgery were not always clear. Some studies found similar ratings for VR training and model practice. One study found that teachers gave better ratings to VR-trained doctors compared to those with no extra training.\\n\\nOverall, the studies suggest that VR training might help new eye doctors. It might make them faster and have fewer problems, especially when compared to no extra training. But we need more clear studies to be sure.\",\n          \"## Plain Language Summary\\n\\n### Plain Title\\nVitamin D for Pregnant Women: How Much is Best?\\n\\n### Rationale\\nDuring pregnancy, some women do not have enough vitamin D. This is called vitamin D deficiency. This can lead to serious health problems for both mom and baby. These problems include:\\n\\n*   **Pre-eclampsia:** This is high blood pressure during pregnancy. It can harm the mother and baby.\\n*   **Gestational diabetes:** This is high blood sugar that starts during pregnancy.\\n*   **Preterm birth:** This is when a baby is born too early.\\n*   **Low birthweight:** This is when a baby weighs too little at birth.\\n\\nWe know that taking vitamin D may help reduce some of these risks. But we are not sure what amount of vitamin D is best. We also want to know if certain amounts are safe. This study looked at different amounts of vitamin D. It compared them to see what worked best and was safest.\\n\\n### Trial Design\\nThis study was a large review of many other studies. It gathered information from 30 studies. These studies included 7,289 pregnant women. All women in these studies took some amount of vitamin D. Some women also took calcium or other vitamins.\\n\\nWe looked at two main things:\\n1.  Did taking more than 600 units of vitamin D each day make a difference?\\n2.  Did taking more than 3,999 units of vitamin D each day make a difference?\\n\\nWe wanted to see how these amounts affected pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and low birthweight. We also looked for any bad side effects. The studies lasted for the full term of the pregnancy.\\n\\n### Results\\nWe found some important things:\\n\\n**Taking more than 600 units of vitamin D each day:**\\n*   It may help lower the risk of gestational diabetes. This is a good benefit for moms.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of pre-eclampsia.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of preterm birth.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of low birthweight.\\n\\n**Taking more than 3,999 units of vitamin D each day:**\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of pre-eclampsia.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of gestational diabetes.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of preterm birth.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of low birthweight.\\n\\nOverall, vitamin D seems safe for pregnant women. There were few or no bad side effects reported. When side effects did happen, they were similar in all groups.\\n\\n**What we learned:**\\nTaking more vitamin D than what is usually suggested may lower the risk of gestational diabetes. But it did not seem to help with other problems like pre-eclampsia or early birth. Even taking high amounts of vitamin D did not seem to cause more problems. More studies are ongoing. They will give us more clear answers in the future.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pls_text_content\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Methotrexate for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease\\nAlthough corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission of Crohn's disease, many patients relapse when steroids are withdrawn or become steroid dependent. Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant side effects. Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug that is used to treat active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. This review includes seven randomized trials with a total of 495 participants. There is evidence from one large study which suggests that methotrexate (25 mg/week) injected intramuscularly for 16 weeks among patients with active treatment resistant Crohn's disease may provide a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids. This reduction in steroid use could reduce steroid\\u2010induced side effects for people with chronic Crohn's disease. Although side effects are more common with high dose methotrexate therapy, no serious side effects have been observed. Common side effects associated with methotrexate therapy include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash and headache. Studies comparing lower dose oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) to placebo (e.g. sugar pill) or other active drugs (e.g. azathioprine or 6\\u2010mercaptopurine) indicate that lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any benefit for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. However, these trials were small in size and further studies of oral methotrexate may be justified. Two studies looked at the combination of methotrexate and infliximab (a biological drug) compared to infliximab therapy alone. These studies indicated that the addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infiximab. However these studies were relatively small and further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant side effects. Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug that is used to treat active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. This review includes seven randomized trials with a total of 495 participants. There is evidence from one large study which suggests that methotrexate (25 mg/week) injected intramuscularly for 16 weeks among patients with active treatment resistant Crohn's disease may provide a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids. This reduction in steroid use could reduce steroid\\u2010induced side effects for people with chronic Crohn's disease. Although side effects are more common with high dose methotrexate therapy, no serious side effects have been observed. Common side effects associated with methotrexate therapy include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash and headache. Studies comparing lower dose oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) to placebo (e.g. sugar pill) or other active drugs (e.g. azathioprine or 6\\u2010mercaptopurine) indicate that lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any benefit for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. However, these trials were small in size and further studies of oral methotrexate may be justified. Two studies looked at the combination of methotrexate and infliximab (a biological drug) compared to infliximab therapy alone. These studies indicated that the addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infiximab. However these studies were relatively small and further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies. \\n\",\n          \"Background\\nCataract surgery is the most common incisional surgical procedure in ophthalmology and is important in ophthalmic graduate medical education. Although most ophthalmology training programs in the United States (US) include virtual reality (VR) training for cataract surgery, comprehensive reviews that detail the impact of VR training on ophthalmology trainee performance are lacking. \\nObjectives\\nTo assess the impact of VR training for cataract surgery on the operating performance of postgraduate ophthalmology trainees, measured by operating time, intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, supervising physician ratings, and VR simulator task ratings. \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase.com, PubMed, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 14 June 2021. \\nSelection criteria\\nWe included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing VR training to any other method of training, including non\\u2010VR simulation training (e.g., wet laboratory training), didactics training, or no supplementary training in postgraduate ophthalmology trainees. \\nData collection and analysis\\nWe used standard Cochrane methodology. Primary outcomes were operating times in the operating room and intraoperative complications. Secondary outcomes were operating times in simulated settings, simulator task ratings, and supervising physician ratings, either in the operating room or simulated settings. \\nMain results\\nWe included six RCTs with a total of 151 postgraduate ophthalmology trainees ranging from 12 to 60 participants in each study. The included studies varied widely in terms of geography: two in the US, and one study each in China, Germany, India, and Morocco. Three studies compared VR training for phacoemulsification cataract surgery on the Eyesi simulator (VRmagic, Mannheim, Germany) with wet laboratory training and two studies compared VR training with no supplementary training. One study compared trainees who received VR training with those who received conventional training for manual small incision cataract surgery on the HelpMeSee simulator (HelpMeSee, New York, NY). Industry financially supported two studies. All studies had at least three domains judged at high or unclear risks of bias. We did not conduct a meta\\u2010analysis due to insufficient data (i.e., lack of precision measurements, or studies reported only P values). All evidence was very low\\u2010certainty, meaning that any estimates were unreliable. \\nThe evidence for the benefits of VR training for trainees was very uncertain for primary outcomes. VR\\u2010trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had shorter operating times (mean difference [MD] \\u221217 minutes, 95% confidence interval [CI] \\u221221.62 to \\u221212.38; 1 study, n = 12; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). Results for operating time were inconsistent when comparing VR and wet laboratory\\u00a0training: one study found that VR relative to wet laboratory training was associated with longer operating times (P = 0.038); the other reported that two training groups had similar operating times (P = 0.14).\\u00a0One study reported that VR\\u2010trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had fewer intraoperative complications (P < 0.001); in another study, VR and conventionally trained trainees had similar intraoperative complication rates (MD \\u22128.31, 95% CI \\u221222.78 to 6.16; 1 study, n = 19; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). \\nFor secondary outcomes, VR training may have similar impact on trainee performance compared to wet laboratory\\u00a0and greater\\u00a0impact compared to no supplementary training, but the evidence was very uncertain. One study reported VR\\u2010trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had significantly reduced operating time in simulated settings (P = 0.0013). Another study reported that VR\\u2010trained relative to wet laboratory\\u2010trained trainees had shorter operating times in VR settings (MD \\u22121.40 minutes, 95% CI \\u22121.96 to \\u22120.84; 1 study, n = 60) and similar times in wet laboratory settings (MD 0.16 minutes, 95% CI \\u22120.50 to 0.82; 1 study, n = 60). This study also found the VR\\u2010trained trainees had higher VR simulator ratings (MD 5.17, 95% CI 0.61 to 9.73; 1 study, n = 60). Results for supervising physician ratings in the operating room were inconsistent: one study reported that VR\\u2010 and wet laboratory\\u2010trained trainees received similar supervising physician ratings for cataract surgery (P = 0.608); another study reported that VR\\u2010trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training were less likely to receive poor ratings by supervising physicians for capsulorhexis construction (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.57). In wet laboratory settings, VR\\u2010trained trainees received similar supervising physician ratings compared with wet laboratory\\u2010trained trainees (MD \\u22121.50, 95% CI \\u22126.77 to 3.77; n = 60) and higher supervising physician ratings compared with trainees without supplementary training (P < 0.0001). However, the results for all secondary outcomes should be interpreted with caution because of very low\\u2010certainty evidence.\\u00a0 \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nCurrent research suggests that VR training may be more effective than no supplementary training in improving trainee performance in the operating room and simulated settings for postgraduate ophthalmology trainees, but the evidence is uncertain. The evidence comparing VR with conventional or wet laboratory training was less consistent. \\n\",\n          \"Background\\nVitamin D deficiency during pregnancy increases the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and low birthweight. In a previous Cochrane Review we found that supplementing pregnant women with vitamin D alone compared to no vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and low birthweight and may increase the risk of preterm births if it is combined with calcium. However the effects of different vitamin D regimens are not yet clear. \\nObjectives\\nTo assess the effects and safety of different regimens of vitamin D supplementation alone or in combination with calcium or other vitamins, minerals or nutrients during pregnancy, specifically doses of 601 international units per day (IU/d) or more versus 600 IU/d or less; and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less. \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth\\u2019s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (12 July 2018), and the reference lists of retrieved studies. \\nSelection criteria\\nRandomised trials evaluating the effect of different vitamin D regimens (dose, frequency, duration, and time of commencement of supplementation during pregnancy), alone or in combination with other nutrients on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes. We only included trials that compared 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less. We did not include in the analysis groups that received no vitamin D, as that comparison is assessed in another Cochrane Review. \\nData collection and analysis\\nTwo review authors independently: i) assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria; ii) extracted data from included studies, and iii) assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. Our primary maternal outcomes were: pre\\u2010eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and any adverse effects; our primary infant outcomes were preterm birth and low birthweight. Data were checked for accuracy. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. \\nMain results\\nIn this review, we included data from 30 trials involving 7289 women. We excluded 11 trials, identified 16 ongoing/unpublished trials and two trials are awaiting classification. Overall risk of bias for the trials was mixed. \\nComparison 1. 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less of vitamin D alone or with any other nutrient (19 trials; 5214 participants) \\nSupplementation with 601 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia (risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.42); 5 trials; 1553 participants,low\\u2010certainty evidence), may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.86; 5 trials; 1846 participants; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence), may make little or no difference to the risk of preterm birth (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.69; 4 trials; 2294 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence); and may make little or no difference to the risk of low birthweight (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.24; 4 trials; 1550 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) compared to women receiving 600 IU/d or less. \\nComparison 2. 4000 IU or more versus 3999 IU or less of vitamin D alone (15 trials; 4763 participants) \\nSupplementation with 4000 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of: pre\\u2010eclampsia (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.22; 4 trials, 1903 participants, low\\u2010certainty evidence); gestational diabetes (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.42; 5 trials, 2276 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence); preterm birth (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.12; 6 trials, 2948 participants, low\\u2010certainty evidence); and low birthweight (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.70; 2 trials; 1099 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence) compared to women receiving 3999 IU/d or less. \\nAdverse events (such as hypercalcaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypercalciuria, and hypovitaminosis D) were reported differently in most trials; however, in general, there was little to no side effects reported or similar cases between groups. \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nSupplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes; however, it may make little or no difference to the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, preterm birth and low birthweight. Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current upper limit for vitamin D seems not to increase the risk of the outcomes evaluated. In general, the GRADE was considered low certainty for most of the primary outcomes due to serious risk of bias and imprecision of results. With respect to safety, it appears that vitamin D supplementation is a safe intervention during pregnancy, although the parameters used to determine this were either not reported or not consistent between trials. Future trials should be consistent in their reports of adverse events. There are 16 ongoing trials that when published, will increase the body of knowledge. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"simplified_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"## Plain Title\\nStudy on a Drug for Crohn's Disease\\n\\n## Rationale\\nCrohn's disease makes the gut swell.

This surgery helps people see better when their eye lens gets cloudy. Learning this surgery is a big part of training for new eye doctors.\\n\\nThis training is very important. New doctors need to learn how to do the surgery well and safely. Many training programs use special virtual reality (VR) tools to help. VR training lets doctors practice without real patients.\\n\\nWe wanted to see if VR training truly helps new eye doctors perform better. We looked at how fast they did surgery and if they had fewer problems. We also checked what their teachers thought of their skills. We think VR training could be a good way to teach new doctors. It gives them a safe place to learn and get better.\\n\\n### Trial Design\\n\\nThis study looked at how different studies were set up. It was a review of studies where people were put into groups by chance. This is called a \\\"randomized controlled trial.\\\"\\n\\nThese studies looked at new eye doctors after medical school. They were learning to do cataract surgery. The studies compared VR training to other ways of learning. This included practicing on models, learning from books, or having no extra training.\\n\\nDoctors in these studies ranged in age, but no specific ages were given. Both male and female doctors were included. The studies came from different parts of the world. We looked at how long it took doctors to do surgery and if they had problems during or after surgery. Teachers also rated their skills. The time a person was in any one study varied.\\n\\n### Results\\n\\nWe looked at six studies that included 151 new eye doctors. These doctors were training to do cataract surgery. The studies came from different countries like the US, China, and Germany.\\n\\nSome studies compared VR training to practicing on models. Other studies compared VR training to no extra training.\\n\\nThe results were not always clear. It was hard to be sure about the benefits of VR training. This is because the studies were set up in different ways.\\n\\nOne study showed that doctors with VR training, compared to those with no extra training, did surgery faster. They took about 17 minutes less. One study also found that doctors with VR training had fewer problems during surgery.\\n\\nWhen comparing VR training to practicing on models, the results were mixed. Some studies found similar times for both groups. One study even found VR training took longer.\\n\\nFor practice in a VR setting, doctors with VR training did surgery faster than those with no extra training. They also did better on VR tasks.\\n\\nTeachers' ratings of doctors in real surgery were not always clear. Some studies found similar ratings for VR training and model practice. One study found that teachers gave better ratings to VR-trained doctors compared to those with no extra training.\\n\\nOverall, the studies suggest that VR training might help new eye doctors. It might make them faster and have fewer problems, especially when compared to no extra training. But we need more clear studies to be sure.\",\n          \"## Plain Language Summary\\n\\n### Plain Title\\nVitamin D for Pregnant Women: How Much is Best?\\n\\n### Rationale\\nDuring pregnancy, some women do not have enough vitamin D. This is called vitamin D deficiency. This can lead to serious health problems for both mom and baby. These problems include:\\n\\n*   **Pre-eclampsia:** This is high blood pressure during pregnancy. It can harm the mother and baby.\\n*   **Gestational diabetes:** This is high blood sugar that starts during pregnancy.\\n*   **Preterm birth:** This is when a baby is born too early.\\n*   **Low birthweight:** This is when a baby weighs too little at birth.\\n\\nWe know that taking vitamin D may help reduce some of these risks. But we are not sure what amount of vitamin D is best. We also want to know if certain amounts are safe. This study looked at different amounts of vitamin D. It compared them to see what worked best and was safest.\\n\\n### Trial Design\\nThis study was a large review of many other studies. It gathered information from 30 studies. These studies included 7,289 pregnant women. All women in these studies took some amount of vitamin D. Some women also took calcium or other vitamins.\\n\\nWe looked at two main things:\\n1.  Did taking more than 600 units of vitamin D each day make a difference?\\n2.  Did taking more than 3,999 units of vitamin D each day make a difference?\\n\\nWe wanted to see how these amounts affected pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and low birthweight. We also looked for any bad side effects. The studies lasted for the full term of the pregnancy.\\n\\n### Results\\nWe found some important things:\\n\\n**Taking more than 600 units of vitamin D each day:**\\n*   It may help lower the risk of gestational diabetes. This is a good benefit for moms.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of pre-eclampsia.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of preterm birth.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of low birthweight.\\n\\n**Taking more than 3,999 units of vitamin D each day:**\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of pre-eclampsia.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of gestational diabetes.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of preterm birth.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of low birthweight.\\n\\nOverall, vitamin D seems safe for pregnant women. There were few or no bad side effects reported. When side effects did happen, they were similar in all groups.\\n\\n**What we learned:**\\nTaking more vitamin D than what is usually suggested may lower the risk of gestational diabetes. But it did not seem to help with other problems like pre-eclampsia or early birth. Even taking high amounts of vitamin D did not seem to cause more problems. More studies are ongoing. They will give us more clear answers in the future.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pls_text_content\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Methotrexate for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease\\nAlthough corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission of Crohn's disease, many patients relapse when steroids are withdrawn or become steroid dependent. Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant side effects. Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug that is used to treat active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. This review includes seven randomized trials with a total of 495 participants. There is evidence from one large study which suggests that methotrexate (25 mg/week) injected intramuscularly for 16 weeks among patients with active treatment resistant Crohn's disease may provide a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids. This reduction in steroid use could reduce steroid\\u2010induced side effects for people with chronic Crohn's disease. Although side effects are more common with high dose methotrexate therapy, no serious side effects have been observed. Common side effects associated with methotrexate therapy include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash and headache. Studies comparing lower dose oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) to placebo (e.g. sugar pill) or other active drugs (e.g. azathioprine or 6\\u2010mercaptopurine) indicate that lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any benefit for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. However, these trials were small in size and further studies of oral methotrexate may be justified. Two studies looked at the combination of methotrexate and infliximab (a biological drug) compared to infliximab therapy alone. These studies indicated that the addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infiximab. However these studies were relatively small and further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies. \\n\",\n          \"Can virtual reality training for cataract surgery supplement or replace other training methods for ophthalmology trainees? \\nKey messagesWe did not find enough evidence to show that virtual reality (VR) training improves cataract surgery performance among ophthalmology trainees compared to wet lab or conventional training. \\nWhat is virtual reality training?VR training uses computer technology to simulate a three\\u2010dimensional interactive environment. \\nHow does cataract surgery training work in ophthalmology trainees?Most postgraduate ophthalmology trainees in the United States (US) transition gradually from performing specific cataract surgery (replacing the cloudy lens inside the eye with an artificial one) steps in a wet laboratory (practicing on cadaver or artificial tissues) or using VR simulators to performing cataract surgery in the operating room. \\nWhy is this question important?VR training is becoming increasingly common in postgraduate ophthalmology training, but comprehensive reviews of the impact of VR training on trainees\\u2019\\u00a0cataract surgery performance are lacking. \\nWhat did we want to find out?The primary aim of this review was to determine whether VR training improved operating room performance (measured by operating time in the operating room, intraoperative [during the operation] complications, or postoperative [after the operation] complications) in cataract surgery for postgraduate ophthalmology trainees. The secondary aim was to identify the impact of VR training on operating time in simulated settings, supervising physician ratings in the operating room or simulator settings, or VR simulation task ratings. \\nHow did we identify and evaluate the evidence?We searched for studies that compared VR training to other training methods such as traditional wet laboratory training or no supplementary training in a postgraduate\\u00a0ophthalmology trainee population. \\nWhat did we find?VR relative to conventional or wet laboratory training did not impact operating times, the rate of intraoperative complications, or supervising physician ratings in the operating room. However, compared to trainees without supplementary training, VR\\u2010trained trainees received higher supervising physician ratings in the operating room. The quality of evidence for all outcomes was very low. \\nWhat does this mean?VR training is a promising intervention for teaching cataract surgery, but more rigorous, evidence\\u2010based studies are needed to gauge its impact on key outcomes such as intraoperative and postoperative complications.\\u00a0 \\nHow up\\u2010to\\u2010date is the evidence?The evidence is current up to 14 June 2021. \\n\",\n          \"Regimens of vitamin D supplementation for women during pregnancy\\nWhat is the issue? \\nThis review evaluated if there are beneficial effects of supplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation (200 international units/day (IU/d) to 600 IU/d) on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes and to evaluate if there are negative health effects when using more than the current upper limit recommendation (4000 IU/d). \\nWhy is this important? \\nVitamin D supplementation in pregnancy compared to no supplementation appears to decrease the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birthweight and may reduce the risk of severe postpartum haemorrhage. However, it is not clear if doses greater than the currently recommended level are needed to observe these health benefits, and if giving more than the upper limit is related to adverse events. \\nWhat was studied in the review? \\nThis review included trials evaluating the effect of different vitamin D regimens (doses, frequencies, duration, and times of commencement) to compare the effects of 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less, of vitamin D alone or with any other nutrient on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes. \\nWhat evidence did we find? \\nEvidence from 19 trials involving 5214 women suggest that supplementation with 601 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes but may make little or no difference to the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, preterm birth or low birthweight compared to women receiving 600 IU/d or less. \\nEvidence from 15 trials involving 4763 women suggests that supplementation with 4000 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth or low birthweight compared to women receiving 3999 IU/d or less. \\nAdverse events were reported differently in most trials; in general, there was little to no side effects reported or similar cases between groups. \\nWhat does this mean? \\nSupplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes; however, it may make little or no difference in the risk of the other outcomes. Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current upper limit for vitamin D seems not to increase the risk of the outcomes evaluated.

Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant side effects. Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug that is used to treat active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. This review includes seven randomized trials with a total of 495 participants. There is evidence from one large study which suggests that methotrexate (25 mg/week) injected intramuscularly for 16 weeks among patients with active treatment resistant Crohn's disease may provide a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids. This reduction in steroid use could reduce steroid\\u2010induced side effects for people with chronic Crohn's disease. Although side effects are more common with high dose methotrexate therapy, no serious side effects have been observed. Common side effects associated with methotrexate therapy include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash and headache. Studies comparing lower dose oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) to placebo (e.g. sugar pill) or other active drugs (e.g. azathioprine or 6\\u2010mercaptopurine) indicate that lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any benefit for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. However, these trials were small in size and further studies of oral methotrexate may be justified. Two studies looked at the combination of methotrexate and infliximab (a biological drug) compared to infliximab therapy alone. These studies indicated that the addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infiximab. However these studies were relatively small and further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies. \\n\",\n          \"Background\\nCataract surgery is the most common incisional surgical procedure in ophthalmology and is important in ophthalmic graduate medical education. Although most ophthalmology training programs in the United States (US) include virtual reality (VR) training for cataract surgery, comprehensive reviews that detail the impact of VR training on ophthalmology trainee performance are lacking. \\nObjectives\\nTo assess the impact of VR training for cataract surgery on the operating performance of postgraduate ophthalmology trainees, measured by operating time, intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, supervising physician ratings, and VR simulator task ratings. \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase.com, PubMed, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 14 June 2021. \\nSelection criteria\\nWe included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing VR training to any other method of training, including non\\u2010VR simulation training (e.g., wet laboratory training), didactics training, or no supplementary training in postgraduate ophthalmology trainees. \\nData collection and analysis\\nWe used standard Cochrane methodology. Primary outcomes were operating times in the operating room and intraoperative complications. Secondary outcomes were operating times in simulated settings, simulator task ratings, and supervising physician ratings, either in the operating room or simulated settings. \\nMain results\\nWe included six RCTs with a total of 151 postgraduate ophthalmology trainees ranging from 12 to 60 participants in each study. The included studies varied widely in terms of geography: two in the US, and one study each in China, Germany, India, and Morocco. Three studies compared VR training for phacoemulsification cataract surgery on the Eyesi simulator (VRmagic, Mannheim, Germany) with wet laboratory training and two studies compared VR training with no supplementary training. One study compared trainees who received VR training with those who received conventional training for manual small incision cataract surgery on the HelpMeSee simulator (HelpMeSee, New York, NY). Industry financially supported two studies. All studies had at least three domains judged at high or unclear risks of bias. We did not conduct a meta\\u2010analysis due to insufficient data (i.e., lack of precision measurements, or studies reported only P values). All evidence was very low\\u2010certainty, meaning that any estimates were unreliable. \\nThe evidence for the benefits of VR training for trainees was very uncertain for primary outcomes. VR\\u2010trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had shorter operating times (mean difference [MD] \\u221217 minutes, 95% confidence interval [CI] \\u221221.62 to \\u221212.38; 1 study, n = 12; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). Results for operating time were inconsistent when comparing VR and wet laboratory\\u00a0training: one study found that VR relative to wet laboratory training was associated with longer operating times (P = 0.038); the other reported that two training groups had similar operating times (P = 0.14).\\u00a0One study reported that VR\\u2010trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had fewer intraoperative complications (P < 0.001); in another study, VR and conventionally trained trainees had similar intraoperative complication rates (MD \\u22128.31, 95% CI \\u221222.78 to 6.16; 1 study, n = 19; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). \\nFor secondary outcomes, VR training may have similar impact on trainee performance compared to wet laboratory\\u00a0and greater\\u00a0impact compared to no supplementary training, but the evidence was very uncertain. One study reported VR\\u2010trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had significantly reduced operating time in simulated settings (P = 0.0013). Another study reported that VR\\u2010trained relative to wet laboratory\\u2010trained trainees had shorter operating times in VR settings (MD \\u22121.40 minutes, 95% CI \\u22121.96 to \\u22120.84; 1 study, n = 60) and similar times in wet laboratory settings (MD 0.16 minutes, 95% CI \\u22120.50 to 0.82; 1 study, n = 60). This study also found the VR\\u2010trained trainees had higher VR simulator ratings (MD 5.17, 95% CI 0.61 to 9.73; 1 study, n = 60). Results for supervising physician ratings in the operating room were inconsistent: one study reported that VR\\u2010 and wet laboratory\\u2010trained trainees received similar supervising physician ratings for cataract surgery (P = 0.608); another study reported that VR\\u2010trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training were less likely to receive poor ratings by supervising physicians for capsulorhexis construction (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.57). In wet laboratory settings, VR\\u2010trained trainees received similar supervising physician ratings compared with wet laboratory\\u2010trained trainees (MD \\u22121.50, 95% CI \\u22126.77 to 3.77; n = 60) and higher supervising physician ratings compared with trainees without supplementary training (P < 0.0001). However, the results for all secondary outcomes should be interpreted with caution because of very low\\u2010certainty evidence.\\u00a0 \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nCurrent research suggests that VR training may be more effective than no supplementary training in improving trainee performance in the operating room and simulated settings for postgraduate ophthalmology trainees, but the evidence is uncertain. The evidence comparing VR with conventional or wet laboratory training was less consistent. \\n\",\n          \"Background\\nVitamin D deficiency during pregnancy increases the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and low birthweight. In a previous Cochrane Review we found that supplementing pregnant women with vitamin D alone compared to no vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and low birthweight and may increase the risk of preterm births if it is combined with calcium. However the effects of different vitamin D regimens are not yet clear. \\nObjectives\\nTo assess the effects and safety of different regimens of vitamin D supplementation alone or in combination with calcium or other vitamins, minerals or nutrients during pregnancy, specifically doses of 601 international units per day (IU/d) or more versus 600 IU/d or less; and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less. \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth\\u2019s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (12 July 2018), and the reference lists of retrieved studies. \\nSelection criteria\\nRandomised trials evaluating the effect of different vitamin D regimens (dose, frequency, duration, and time of commencement of supplementation during pregnancy), alone or in combination with other nutrients on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes. We only included trials that compared 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less. We did not include in the analysis groups that received no vitamin D, as that comparison is assessed in another Cochrane Review. \\nData collection and analysis\\nTwo review authors independently: i) assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria; ii) extracted data from included studies, and iii) assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. Our primary maternal outcomes were: pre\\u2010eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and any adverse effects; our primary infant outcomes were preterm birth and low birthweight. Data were checked for accuracy. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. \\nMain results\\nIn this review, we included data from 30 trials involving 7289 women. We excluded 11 trials, identified 16 ongoing/unpublished trials and two trials are awaiting classification. Overall risk of bias for the trials was mixed. \\nComparison 1. 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less of vitamin D alone or with any other nutrient (19 trials; 5214 participants) \\nSupplementation with 601 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia (risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.42); 5 trials; 1553 participants,low\\u2010certainty evidence), may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.86; 5 trials; 1846 participants; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence), may make little or no difference to the risk of preterm birth (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.69; 4 trials; 2294 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence); and may make little or no difference to the risk of low birthweight (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.24; 4 trials; 1550 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) compared to women receiving 600 IU/d or less. \\nComparison 2. 4000 IU or more versus 3999 IU or less of vitamin D alone (15 trials; 4763 participants) \\nSupplementation with 4000 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of: pre\\u2010eclampsia (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.22; 4 trials, 1903 participants, low\\u2010certainty evidence); gestational diabetes (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.42; 5 trials, 2276 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence); preterm birth (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.12; 6 trials, 2948 participants, low\\u2010certainty evidence); and low birthweight (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.70; 2 trials; 1099 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence) compared to women receiving 3999 IU/d or less. \\nAdverse events (such as hypercalcaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypercalciuria, and hypovitaminosis D) were reported differently in most trials; however, in general, there was little to no side effects reported or similar cases between groups. \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nSupplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes; however, it may make little or no difference to the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, preterm birth and low birthweight. Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current upper limit for vitamin D seems not to increase the risk of the outcomes evaluated. In general, the GRADE was considered low certainty for most of the primary outcomes due to serious risk of bias and imprecision of results. With respect to safety, it appears that vitamin D supplementation is a safe intervention during pregnancy, although the parameters used to determine this were either not reported or not consistent between trials. Future trials should be consistent in their reports of adverse events. There are 16 ongoing trials that when published, will increase the body of knowledge. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"simplified_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"## Plain Title\\nStudy on a Drug for Crohn's Disease\\n\\n## Rationale\\nCrohn's disease makes the gut swell.

The study wanted to see if methotrexate could help. It aimed to help patients feel better. It also aimed to help them stop using steroids.\\n\\n## Trial Design\\nThis study looked at other studies. It gathered facts from seven past trials. These trials had 495 people in total. The people in these studies had Crohn's disease. Their disease was still active. Other drugs had not worked well for them.\\n\\nOne main study looked at methotrexate. Patients got a shot of methotrexate. They got 25 mg each week. This went on for 16 weeks. The goal was to see if they got better. It also looked if they could stop steroids.\\n\\nOther studies looked at methotrexate pills. They used a lower dose. Patients took 12.5 to 15 mg each week. Some got a fake pill. Some got other drugs. These studies were small.\\n\\nSome studies looked at methotrexate with another drug. This drug is called infliximab. They checked if adding methotrexate helped more.\\n\\n## Results\\nOne large study showed good results. Methotrexate shots helped patients feel better. It helped them stop taking steroids. This means fewer bad problems from steroids. Patients with Crohn's disease could live better lives.\\n\\nThis study used 25 mg of methotrexate weekly. Patients got a shot. This went on for 16 weeks. It helped them get better. It also helped them stop steroids. This is a big help. It means fewer side effects from steroids.\\n\\nMethotrexate can have side effects. These include feeling sick to your stomach. You might throw up. You might have tummy pain. Diarrhea and skin rash can also happen. Headaches are also possible. But no serious problems were seen in this study.\\n\\nLower doses of methotrexate pills did not work as well. This was based on smaller studies. More study is needed for methotrexate pills.\\n\\nAdding methotrexate to infliximab did not seem to help more. This was in small studies. More research is needed for this.\\n\\nThe study showed methotrexate shots can help. It helps people with active Crohn's disease. It helps them feel better. It also lowers steroid use. This is good news for many patients.\",\n          \"Here is a Plain Language Summary of the provided abstract:\\n\\n## How Virtual Reality Training Helps Eye Doctors Learn Surgery\\n\\n### Rationale\\n\\nEye doctors often do a surgery called cataract surgery. This surgery helps people see better when their eye lens gets cloudy. Learning this surgery is a big part of training for new eye doctors.\\n\\nThis training is very important. New doctors need to learn how to do the surgery well and safely. Many training programs use special virtual reality (VR) tools to help. VR training lets doctors practice without real patients.\\n\\nWe wanted to see if VR training truly helps new eye doctors perform better. We looked at how fast they did surgery and if they had fewer problems. We also checked what their teachers thought of their skills. We think VR training could be a good way to teach new doctors. It gives them a safe place to learn and get better.\\n\\n### Trial Design\\n\\nThis study looked at how different studies were set up. It was a review of studies where people were put into groups by chance. This is called a \\\"randomized controlled trial.\\\"\\n\\nThese studies looked at new eye doctors after medical school. They were learning to do cataract surgery. The studies compared VR training to other ways of learning. This included practicing on models, learning from books, or having no extra training.\\n\\nDoctors in these studies ranged in age, but no specific ages were given. Both male and female doctors were included. The studies came from different parts of the world. We looked at how long it took doctors to do surgery and if they had problems during or after surgery. Teachers also rated their skills. The time a person was in any one study varied.\\n\\n### Results\\n\\nWe looked at six studies that included 151 new eye doctors. These doctors were training to do cataract surgery. The studies came from different countries like the US, China, and Germany.\\n\\nSome studies compared VR training to practicing on models. Other studies compared VR training to no extra training.\\n\\nThe results were not always clear. It was hard to be sure about the benefits of VR training. This is because the studies were set up in different ways.\\n\\nOne study showed that doctors with VR training, compared to those with no extra training, did surgery faster. They took about 17 minutes less. One study also found that doctors with VR training had fewer problems during surgery.\\n\\nWhen comparing VR training to practicing on models, the results were mixed. Some studies found similar times for both groups. One study even found VR training took longer.\\n\\nFor practice in a VR setting, doctors with VR training did surgery faster than those with no extra training. They also did better on VR tasks.\\n\\nTeachers' ratings of doctors in real surgery were not always clear. Some studies found similar ratings for VR training and model practice. One study found that teachers gave better ratings to VR-trained doctors compared to those with no extra training.\\n\\nOverall, the studies suggest that VR training might help new eye doctors. It might make them faster and have fewer problems, especially when compared to no extra training. But we need more clear studies to be sure.\",\n          \"## Plain Language Summary\\n\\n### Plain Title\\nVitamin D for Pregnant Women: How Much is Best?\\n\\n### Rationale\\nDuring pregnancy, some women do not have enough vitamin D. This is called vitamin D deficiency. This can lead to serious health problems for both mom and baby. These problems include:\\n\\n*   **Pre-eclampsia:** This is high blood pressure during pregnancy. It can harm the mother and baby.\\n*   **Gestational diabetes:** This is high blood sugar that starts during pregnancy.\\n*   **Preterm birth:** This is when a baby is born too early.\\n*   **Low birthweight:** This is when a baby weighs too little at birth.\\n\\nWe know that taking vitamin D may help reduce some of these risks. But we are not sure what amount of vitamin D is best. We also want to know if certain amounts are safe. This study looked at different amounts of vitamin D. It compared them to see what worked best and was safest.\\n\\n### Trial Design\\nThis study was a large review of many other studies. It gathered information from 30 studies. These studies included 7,289 pregnant women. All women in these studies took some amount of vitamin D. Some women also took calcium or other vitamins.\\n\\nWe looked at two main things:\\n1.  Did taking more than 600 units of vitamin D each day make a difference?\\n2.  Did taking more than 3,999 units of vitamin D each day make a difference?\\n\\nWe wanted to see how these amounts affected pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and low birthweight. We also looked for any bad side effects. The studies lasted for the full term of the pregnancy.\\n\\n### Results\\nWe found some important things:\\n\\n**Taking more than 600 units of vitamin D each day:**\\n*   It may help lower the risk of gestational diabetes. This is a good benefit for moms.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of pre-eclampsia.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of preterm birth.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of low birthweight.\\n\\n**Taking more than 3,999 units of vitamin D each day:**\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of pre-eclampsia.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of gestational diabetes.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of preterm birth.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of low birthweight.\\n\\nOverall, vitamin D seems safe for pregnant women. There were few or no bad side effects reported. When side effects did happen, they were similar in all groups.\\n\\n**What we learned:**\\nTaking more vitamin D than what is usually suggested may lower the risk of gestational diabetes. But it did not seem to help with other problems like pre-eclampsia or early birth. Even taking high amounts of vitamin D did not seem to cause more problems. More studies are ongoing. They will give us more clear answers in the future.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pls_text_content\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Methotrexate for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease\\nAlthough corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission of Crohn's disease, many patients relapse when steroids are withdrawn or become steroid dependent. Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant side effects. Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug that is used to treat active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. This review includes seven randomized trials with a total of 495 participants. There is evidence from one large study which suggests that methotrexate (25 mg/week) injected intramuscularly for 16 weeks among patients with active treatment resistant Crohn's disease may provide a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids. This reduction in steroid use could reduce steroid\\u2010induced side effects for people with chronic Crohn's disease. Although side effects are more common with high dose methotrexate therapy, no serious side effects have been observed. Common side effects associated with methotrexate therapy include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash and headache. Studies comparing lower dose oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) to placebo (e.g. sugar pill) or other active drugs (e.g. azathioprine or 6\\u2010mercaptopurine) indicate that lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any benefit for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. However, these trials were small in size and further studies of oral methotrexate may be justified. Two studies looked at the combination of methotrexate and infliximab (a biological drug) compared to infliximab therapy alone. These studies indicated that the addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infiximab. However these studies were relatively small and further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies. \\n\",\n          \"Can virtual reality training for cataract surgery supplement or replace other training methods for ophthalmology trainees? \\nKey messagesWe did not find enough evidence to show that virtual reality (VR) training improves cataract surgery performance among ophthalmology trainees compared to wet lab or conventional training. \\nWhat is virtual reality training?VR training uses computer technology to simulate a three\\u2010dimensional interactive environment. \\nHow does cataract surgery training work in ophthalmology trainees?Most postgraduate ophthalmology trainees in the United States (US) transition gradually from performing specific cataract surgery (replacing the cloudy lens inside the eye with an artificial one) steps in a wet laboratory (practicing on cadaver or artificial tissues) or using VR simulators to performing cataract surgery in the operating room. \\nWhy is this question important?VR training is becoming increasingly common in postgraduate ophthalmology training, but comprehensive reviews of the impact of VR training on trainees\\u2019\\u00a0cataract surgery performance are lacking. \\nWhat did we want to find out?The primary aim of this review was to determine whether VR training improved operating room performance (measured by operating time in the operating room, intraoperative [during the operation] complications, or postoperative [after the operation] complications) in cataract surgery for postgraduate ophthalmology trainees. The secondary aim was to identify the impact of VR training on operating time in simulated settings, supervising physician ratings in the operating room or simulator settings, or VR simulation task ratings. \\nHow did we identify and evaluate the evidence?We searched for studies that compared VR training to other training methods such as traditional wet laboratory training or no supplementary training in a postgraduate\\u00a0ophthalmology trainee population. \\nWhat did we find?VR relative to conventional or wet laboratory training did not impact operating times, the rate of intraoperative complications, or supervising physician ratings in the operating room. However, compared to trainees without supplementary training, VR\\u2010trained trainees received higher supervising physician ratings in the operating room. The quality of evidence for all outcomes was very low. \\nWhat does this mean?VR training is a promising intervention for teaching cataract surgery, but more rigorous, evidence\\u2010based studies are needed to gauge its impact on key outcomes such as intraoperative and postoperative complications.\\u00a0 \\nHow up\\u2010to\\u2010date is the evidence?The evidence is current up to 14 June 2021. \\n\",\n          \"Regimens of vitamin D supplementation for women during pregnancy\\nWhat is the issue? \\nThis review evaluated if there are beneficial effects of supplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation (200 international units/day (IU/d) to 600 IU/d) on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes and to evaluate if there are negative health effects when using more than the current upper limit recommendation (4000 IU/d). \\nWhy is this important? \\nVitamin D supplementation in pregnancy compared to no supplementation appears to decrease the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birthweight and may reduce the risk of severe postpartum haemorrhage. However, it is not clear if doses greater than the currently recommended level are needed to observe these health benefits, and if giving more than the upper limit is related to adverse events. \\nWhat was studied in the review? \\nThis review included trials evaluating the effect of different vitamin D regimens (doses, frequencies, duration, and times of commencement) to compare the effects of 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less, of vitamin D alone or with any other nutrient on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes. \\nWhat evidence did we find? \\nEvidence from 19 trials involving 5214 women suggest that supplementation with 601 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes but may make little or no difference to the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, preterm birth or low birthweight compared to women receiving 600 IU/d or less. \\nEvidence from 15 trials involving 4763 women suggests that supplementation with 4000 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth or low birthweight compared to women receiving 3999 IU/d or less. \\nAdverse events were reported differently in most trials; in general, there was little to no side effects reported or similar cases between groups. \\nWhat does this mean? \\nSupplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes; however, it may make little or no difference in the risk of the other outcomes. Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current upper limit for vitamin D seems not to increase the risk of the outcomes evaluated. Vitamin D supplementation appears to be safe. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertscore\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.01021543258078406,\n        \"min\": 0.8163706660270691,\n        \"max\": 0.8387226462364197,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8387226462364197,\n          0.8167865872383118,\n          0.8343364596366882\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant side effects. Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug that is used to treat active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. This review includes seven randomized trials with a total of 495 participants. There is evidence from one large study which suggests that methotrexate (25 mg/week) injected intramuscularly for 16 weeks among patients with active treatment resistant Crohn's disease may provide a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids. This reduction in steroid use could reduce steroid\\u2010induced side effects for people with chronic Crohn's disease. Although side effects are more common with high dose methotrexate therapy, no serious side effects have been observed. Common side effects associated with methotrexate therapy include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash and headache. Studies comparing lower dose oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) to placebo (e.g. sugar pill) or other active drugs (e.g. azathioprine or 6\\u2010mercaptopurine) indicate that lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any benefit for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. However, these trials were small in size and further studies of oral methotrexate may be justified. Two studies looked at the combination of methotrexate and infliximab (a biological drug) compared to infliximab therapy alone. These studies indicated that the addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infiximab. However these studies were relatively small and further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies. \\n\",\n          \"Background\\nCataract surgery is the most common incisional surgical procedure in ophthalmology and is important in ophthalmic graduate medical education. Although most ophthalmology training programs in the United States (US) include virtual reality (VR) training for cataract surgery, comprehensive reviews that detail the impact of VR training on ophthalmology trainee performance are lacking. \\nObjectives\\nTo assess the impact of VR training for cataract surgery on the operating performance of postgraduate ophthalmology trainees, measured by operating time, intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, supervising physician ratings, and VR simulator task ratings. \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase.com, PubMed, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 14 June 2021. \\nSelection criteria\\nWe included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing VR training to any other method of training, including non\\u2010VR simulation training (e.g., wet laboratory training), didactics training, or no supplementary training in postgraduate ophthalmology trainees. \\nData collection and analysis\\nWe used standard Cochrane methodology. Primary outcomes were operating times in the operating room and intraoperative complications. Secondary outcomes were operating times in simulated settings, simulator task ratings, and supervising physician ratings, either in the operating room or simulated settings. \\nMain results\\nWe included six RCTs with a total of 151 postgraduate ophthalmology trainees ranging from 12 to 60 participants in each study. The included studies varied widely in terms of geography: two in the US, and one study each in China, Germany, India, and Morocco. Three studies compared VR training for phacoemulsification cataract surgery on the Eyesi simulator (VRmagic, Mannheim, Germany) with wet laboratory training and two studies compared VR training with no supplementary training. One study compared trainees who received VR training with those who received conventional training for manual small incision cataract surgery on the HelpMeSee simulator (HelpMeSee, New York, NY). Industry financially supported two studies. All studies had at least three domains judged at high or unclear risks of bias. We did not conduct a meta\\u2010analysis due to insufficient data (i.e., lack of precision measurements, or studies reported only P values). All evidence was very low\\u2010certainty, meaning that any estimates were unreliable. \\nThe evidence for the benefits of VR training for trainees was very uncertain for primary outcomes. VR\\u2010trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had shorter operating times (mean difference [MD] \\u221217 minutes, 95% confidence interval [CI] \\u221221.62 to \\u221212.38; 1 study, n = 12; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). Results for operating time were inconsistent when comparing VR and wet laboratory\\u00a0training: one study found that VR relative to wet laboratory training was associated with longer operating times (P = 0.038); the other reported that two training groups had similar operating times (P = 0.14).\\u00a0One study reported that VR\\u2010trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had fewer intraoperative complications (P < 0.001); in another study, VR and conventionally trained trainees had similar intraoperative complication rates (MD \\u22128.31, 95% CI \\u221222.78 to 6.16; 1 study, n = 19; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). \\nFor secondary outcomes, VR training may have similar impact on trainee performance compared to wet laboratory\\u00a0and greater\\u00a0impact compared to no supplementary training, but the evidence was very uncertain. One study reported VR\\u2010trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had significantly reduced operating time in simulated settings (P = 0.0013). Another study reported that VR\\u2010trained relative to wet laboratory\\u2010trained trainees had shorter operating times in VR settings (MD \\u22121.40 minutes, 95% CI \\u22121.96 to \\u22120.84; 1 study, n = 60) and similar times in wet laboratory settings (MD 0.16 minutes, 95% CI \\u22120.50 to 0.82; 1 study, n = 60). This study also found the VR\\u2010trained trainees had higher VR simulator ratings (MD 5.17, 95% CI 0.61 to 9.73; 1 study, n = 60). Results for supervising physician ratings in the operating room were inconsistent: one study reported that VR\\u2010 and wet laboratory\\u2010trained trainees received similar supervising physician ratings for cataract surgery (P = 0.608); another study reported that VR\\u2010trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training were less likely to receive poor ratings by supervising physicians for capsulorhexis construction (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.57). In wet laboratory settings, VR\\u2010trained trainees received similar supervising physician ratings compared with wet laboratory\\u2010trained trainees (MD \\u22121.50, 95% CI \\u22126.77 to 3.77; n = 60) and higher supervising physician ratings compared with trainees without supplementary training (P < 0.0001). However, the results for all secondary outcomes should be interpreted with caution because of very low\\u2010certainty evidence.\\u00a0 \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nCurrent research suggests that VR training may be more effective than no supplementary training in improving trainee performance in the operating room and simulated settings for postgraduate ophthalmology trainees, but the evidence is uncertain. The evidence comparing VR with conventional or wet laboratory training was less consistent. \\n\",\n          \"Background\\nVitamin D deficiency during pregnancy increases the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and low birthweight. In a previous Cochrane Review we found that supplementing pregnant women with vitamin D alone compared to no vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and low birthweight and may increase the risk of preterm births if it is combined with calcium. However the effects of different vitamin D regimens are not yet clear. \\nObjectives\\nTo assess the effects and safety of different regimens of vitamin D supplementation alone or in combination with calcium or other vitamins, minerals or nutrients during pregnancy, specifically doses of 601 international units per day (IU/d) or more versus 600 IU/d or less; and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less. \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth\\u2019s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (12 July 2018), and the reference lists of retrieved studies. \\nSelection criteria\\nRandomised trials evaluating the effect of different vitamin D regimens (dose, frequency, duration, and time of commencement of supplementation during pregnancy), alone or in combination with other nutrients on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes. We only included trials that compared 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less. We did not include in the analysis groups that received no vitamin D, as that comparison is assessed in another Cochrane Review. \\nData collection and analysis\\nTwo review authors independently: i) assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria; ii) extracted data from included studies, and iii) assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. Our primary maternal outcomes were: pre\\u2010eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and any adverse effects; our primary infant outcomes were preterm birth and low birthweight. Data were checked for accuracy. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. \\nMain results\\nIn this review, we included data from 30 trials involving 7289 women. We excluded 11 trials, identified 16 ongoing/unpublished trials and two trials are awaiting classification. Overall risk of bias for the trials was mixed. \\nComparison 1. 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less of vitamin D alone or with any other nutrient (19 trials; 5214 participants) \\nSupplementation with 601 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia (risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.42); 5 trials; 1553 participants,low\\u2010certainty evidence), may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.86; 5 trials; 1846 participants; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence), may make little or no difference to the risk of preterm birth (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.69; 4 trials; 2294 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence); and may make little or no difference to the risk of low birthweight (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.24; 4 trials; 1550 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) compared to women receiving 600 IU/d or less. \\nComparison 2. 4000 IU or more versus 3999 IU or less of vitamin D alone (15 trials; 4763 participants) \\nSupplementation with 4000 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of: pre\\u2010eclampsia (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.22; 4 trials, 1903 participants, low\\u2010certainty evidence); gestational diabetes (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.42; 5 trials, 2276 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence); preterm birth (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.12; 6 trials, 2948 participants, low\\u2010certainty evidence); and low birthweight (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.70; 2 trials; 1099 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence) compared to women receiving 3999 IU/d or less. \\nAdverse events (such as hypercalcaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypercalciuria, and hypovitaminosis D) were reported differently in most trials; however, in general, there was little to no side effects reported or similar cases between groups. \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nSupplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes; however, it may make little or no difference to the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, preterm birth and low birthweight. Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current upper limit for vitamin D seems not to increase the risk of the outcomes evaluated. In general, the GRADE was considered low certainty for most of the primary outcomes due to serious risk of bias and imprecision of results. With respect to safety, it appears that vitamin D supplementation is a safe intervention during pregnancy, although the parameters used to determine this were either not reported or not consistent between trials. Future trials should be consistent in their reports of adverse events. There are 16 ongoing trials that when published, will increase the body of knowledge. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"simplified_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"## Plain Title\\nStudy on a Drug for Crohn's Disease\\n\\n## Rationale\\nCrohn's disease makes the gut swell.

This surgery helps people see better when their eye lens gets cloudy. Learning this surgery is a big part of training for new eye doctors.\\n\\nThis training is very important. New doctors need to learn how to do the surgery well and safely. Many training programs use special virtual reality (VR) tools to help. VR training lets doctors practice without real patients.\\n\\nWe wanted to see if VR training truly helps new eye doctors perform better. We looked at how fast they did surgery and if they had fewer problems. We also checked what their teachers thought of their skills. We think VR training could be a good way to teach new doctors. It gives them a safe place to learn and get better.\\n\\n### Trial Design\\n\\nThis study looked at how different studies were set up. It was a review of studies where people were put into groups by chance. This is called a \\\"randomized controlled trial.\\\"\\n\\nThese studies looked at new eye doctors after medical school. They were learning to do cataract surgery. The studies compared VR training to other ways of learning. This included practicing on models, learning from books, or having no extra training.\\n\\nDoctors in these studies ranged in age, but no specific ages were given. Both male and female doctors were included. The studies came from different parts of the world. We looked at how long it took doctors to do surgery and if they had problems during or after surgery. Teachers also rated their skills. The time a person was in any one study varied.\\n\\n### Results\\n\\nWe looked at six studies that included 151 new eye doctors. These doctors were training to do cataract surgery. The studies came from different countries like the US, China, and Germany.\\n\\nSome studies compared VR training to practicing on models. Other studies compared VR training to no extra training.\\n\\nThe results were not always clear. It was hard to be sure about the benefits of VR training. This is because the studies were set up in different ways.\\n\\nOne study showed that doctors with VR training, compared to those with no extra training, did surgery faster. They took about 17 minutes less. One study also found that doctors with VR training had fewer problems during surgery.\\n\\nWhen comparing VR training to practicing on models, the results were mixed. Some studies found similar times for both groups. One study even found VR training took longer.\\n\\nFor practice in a VR setting, doctors with VR training did surgery faster than those with no extra training. They also did better on VR tasks.\\n\\nTeachers' ratings of doctors in real surgery were not always clear. Some studies found similar ratings for VR training and model practice. One study found that teachers gave better ratings to VR-trained doctors compared to those with no extra training.\\n\\nOverall, the studies suggest that VR training might help new eye doctors. It might make them faster and have fewer problems, especially when compared to no extra training. But we need more clear studies to be sure.\",\n          \"## Plain Language Summary\\n\\n### Plain Title\\nVitamin D for Pregnant Women: How Much is Best?\\n\\n### Rationale\\nDuring pregnancy, some women do not have enough vitamin D. This is called vitamin D deficiency. This can lead to serious health problems for both mom and baby. These problems include:\\n\\n*   **Pre-eclampsia:** This is high blood pressure during pregnancy. It can harm the mother and baby.\\n*   **Gestational diabetes:** This is high blood sugar that starts during pregnancy.\\n*   **Preterm birth:** This is when a baby is born too early.\\n*   **Low birthweight:** This is when a baby weighs too little at birth.\\n\\nWe know that taking vitamin D may help reduce some of these risks. But we are not sure what amount of vitamin D is best. We also want to know if certain amounts are safe. This study looked at different amounts of vitamin D. It compared them to see what worked best and was safest.\\n\\n### Trial Design\\nThis study was a large review of many other studies. It gathered information from 30 studies. These studies included 7,289 pregnant women. All women in these studies took some amount of vitamin D. Some women also took calcium or other vitamins.\\n\\nWe looked at two main things:\\n1.  Did taking more than 600 units of vitamin D each day make a difference?\\n2.  Did taking more than 3,999 units of vitamin D each day make a difference?\\n\\nWe wanted to see how these amounts affected pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and low birthweight. We also looked for any bad side effects. The studies lasted for the full term of the pregnancy.\\n\\n### Results\\nWe found some important things:\\n\\n**Taking more than 600 units of vitamin D each day:**\\n*   It may help lower the risk of gestational diabetes. This is a good benefit for moms.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of pre-eclampsia.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of preterm birth.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of low birthweight.\\n\\n**Taking more than 3,999 units of vitamin D each day:**\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of pre-eclampsia.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of gestational diabetes.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of preterm birth.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of low birthweight.\\n\\nOverall, vitamin D seems safe for pregnant women. There were few or no bad side effects reported. When side effects did happen, they were similar in all groups.\\n\\n**What we learned:**\\nTaking more vitamin D than what is usually suggested may lower the risk of gestational diabetes. But it did not seem to help with other problems like pre-eclampsia or early birth. Even taking high amounts of vitamin D did not seem to cause more problems. More studies are ongoing. They will give us more clear answers in the future.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pls_text_content\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Methotrexate for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease\\nAlthough corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission of Crohn's disease, many patients relapse when steroids are withdrawn or become steroid dependent. Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant side effects. Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug that is used to treat active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. This review includes seven randomized trials with a total of 495 participants. There is evidence from one large study which suggests that methotrexate (25 mg/week) injected intramuscularly for 16 weeks among patients with active treatment resistant Crohn's disease may provide a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids. This reduction in steroid use could reduce steroid\\u2010induced side effects for people with chronic Crohn's disease. Although side effects are more common with high dose methotrexate therapy, no serious side effects have been observed. Common side effects associated with methotrexate therapy include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash and headache. Studies comparing lower dose oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) to placebo (e.g. sugar pill) or other active drugs (e.g. azathioprine or 6\\u2010mercaptopurine) indicate that lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any benefit for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. However, these trials were small in size and further studies of oral methotrexate may be justified. Two studies looked at the combination of methotrexate and infliximab (a biological drug) compared to infliximab therapy alone. These studies indicated that the addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infiximab. However these studies were relatively small and further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies. \\n\",\n          \"Can virtual reality training for cataract surgery supplement or replace other training methods for ophthalmology trainees? \\nKey messagesWe did not find enough evidence to show that virtual reality (VR) training improves cataract surgery performance among ophthalmology trainees compared to wet lab or conventional training. \\nWhat is virtual reality training?VR training uses computer technology to simulate a three\\u2010dimensional interactive environment. \\nHow does cataract surgery training work in ophthalmology trainees?Most postgraduate ophthalmology trainees in the United States (US) transition gradually from performing specific cataract surgery (replacing the cloudy lens inside the eye with an artificial one) steps in a wet laboratory (practicing on cadaver or artificial tissues) or using VR simulators to performing cataract surgery in the operating room. \\nWhy is this question important?VR training is becoming increasingly common in postgraduate ophthalmology training, but comprehensive reviews of the impact of VR training on trainees\\u2019\\u00a0cataract surgery performance are lacking. \\nWhat did we want to find out?The primary aim of this review was to determine whether VR training improved operating room performance (measured by operating time in the operating room, intraoperative [during the operation] complications, or postoperative [after the operation] complications) in cataract surgery for postgraduate ophthalmology trainees. The secondary aim was to identify the impact of VR training on operating time in simulated settings, supervising physician ratings in the operating room or simulator settings, or VR simulation task ratings. \\nHow did we identify and evaluate the evidence?We searched for studies that compared VR training to other training methods such as traditional wet laboratory training or no supplementary training in a postgraduate\\u00a0ophthalmology trainee population. \\nWhat did we find?VR relative to conventional or wet laboratory training did not impact operating times, the rate of intraoperative complications, or supervising physician ratings in the operating room. However, compared to trainees without supplementary training, VR\\u2010trained trainees received higher supervising physician ratings in the operating room. The quality of evidence for all outcomes was very low. \\nWhat does this mean?VR training is a promising intervention for teaching cataract surgery, but more rigorous, evidence\\u2010based studies are needed to gauge its impact on key outcomes such as intraoperative and postoperative complications.\\u00a0 \\nHow up\\u2010to\\u2010date is the evidence?The evidence is current up to 14 June 2021. \\n\",\n          \"Regimens of vitamin D supplementation for women during pregnancy\\nWhat is the issue? \\nThis review evaluated if there are beneficial effects of supplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation (200 international units/day (IU/d) to 600 IU/d) on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes and to evaluate if there are negative health effects when using more than the current upper limit recommendation (4000 IU/d). \\nWhy is this important? \\nVitamin D supplementation in pregnancy compared to no supplementation appears to decrease the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birthweight and may reduce the risk of severe postpartum haemorrhage. However, it is not clear if doses greater than the currently recommended level are needed to observe these health benefits, and if giving more than the upper limit is related to adverse events. \\nWhat was studied in the review? \\nThis review included trials evaluating the effect of different vitamin D regimens (doses, frequencies, duration, and times of commencement) to compare the effects of 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less, of vitamin D alone or with any other nutrient on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes. \\nWhat evidence did we find? \\nEvidence from 19 trials involving 5214 women suggest that supplementation with 601 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes but may make little or no difference to the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, preterm birth or low birthweight compared to women receiving 600 IU/d or less. \\nEvidence from 15 trials involving 4763 women suggests that supplementation with 4000 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth or low birthweight compared to women receiving 3999 IU/d or less. \\nAdverse events were reported differently in most trials; in general, there was little to no side effects reported or similar cases between groups. \\nWhat does this mean? \\nSupplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes; however, it may make little or no difference in the risk of the other outcomes. Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current upper limit for vitamin D seems not to increase the risk of the outcomes evaluated.

Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant side effects. Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug that is used to treat active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. This review includes seven randomized trials with a total of 495 participants. There is evidence from one large study which suggests that methotrexate (25 mg/week) injected intramuscularly for 16 weeks among patients with active treatment resistant Crohn's disease may provide a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids. This reduction in steroid use could reduce steroid\\u2010induced side effects for people with chronic Crohn's disease. Although side effects are more common with high dose methotrexate therapy, no serious side effects have been observed. Common side effects associated with methotrexate therapy include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash and headache. Studies comparing lower dose oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) to placebo (e.g. sugar pill) or other active drugs (e.g. azathioprine or 6\\u2010mercaptopurine) indicate that lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any benefit for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. However, these trials were small in size and further studies of oral methotrexate may be justified. Two studies looked at the combination of methotrexate and infliximab (a biological drug) compared to infliximab therapy alone. These studies indicated that the addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infiximab. However these studies were relatively small and further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies. \\n\",\n          \"Background\\nCataract surgery is the most common incisional surgical procedure in ophthalmology and is important in ophthalmic graduate medical education. Although most ophthalmology training programs in the United States (US) include virtual reality (VR) training for cataract surgery, comprehensive reviews that detail the impact of VR training on ophthalmology trainee performance are lacking. \\nObjectives\\nTo assess the impact of VR training for cataract surgery on the operating performance of postgraduate ophthalmology trainees, measured by operating time, intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, supervising physician ratings, and VR simulator task ratings. \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase.com, PubMed, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 14 June 2021. \\nSelection criteria\\nWe included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing VR training to any other method of training, including non\\u2010VR simulation training (e.g., wet laboratory training), didactics training, or no supplementary training in postgraduate ophthalmology trainees. \\nData collection and analysis\\nWe used standard Cochrane methodology. Primary outcomes were operating times in the operating room and intraoperative complications. Secondary outcomes were operating times in simulated settings, simulator task ratings, and supervising physician ratings, either in the operating room or simulated settings. \\nMain results\\nWe included six RCTs with a total of 151 postgraduate ophthalmology trainees ranging from 12 to 60 participants in each study. The included studies varied widely in terms of geography: two in the US, and one study each in China, Germany, India, and Morocco. Three studies compared VR training for phacoemulsification cataract surgery on the Eyesi simulator (VRmagic, Mannheim, Germany) with wet laboratory training and two studies compared VR training with no supplementary training. One study compared trainees who received VR training with those who received conventional training for manual small incision cataract surgery on the HelpMeSee simulator (HelpMeSee, New York, NY). Industry financially supported two studies. All studies had at least three domains judged at high or unclear risks of bias. We did not conduct a meta\\u2010analysis due to insufficient data (i.e., lack of precision measurements, or studies reported only P values). All evidence was very low\\u2010certainty, meaning that any estimates were unreliable. \\nThe evidence for the benefits of VR training for trainees was very uncertain for primary outcomes. VR\\u2010trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had shorter operating times (mean difference [MD] \\u221217 minutes, 95% confidence interval [CI] \\u221221.62 to \\u221212.38; 1 study, n = 12; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). Results for operating time were inconsistent when comparing VR and wet laboratory\\u00a0training: one study found that VR relative to wet laboratory training was associated with longer operating times (P = 0.038); the other reported that two training groups had similar operating times (P = 0.14).\\u00a0One study reported that VR\\u2010trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had fewer intraoperative complications (P < 0.001); in another study, VR and conventionally trained trainees had similar intraoperative complication rates (MD \\u22128.31, 95% CI \\u221222.78 to 6.16; 1 study, n = 19; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). \\nFor secondary outcomes, VR training may have similar impact on trainee performance compared to wet laboratory\\u00a0and greater\\u00a0impact compared to no supplementary training, but the evidence was very uncertain. One study reported VR\\u2010trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had significantly reduced operating time in simulated settings (P = 0.0013). Another study reported that VR\\u2010trained relative to wet laboratory\\u2010trained trainees had shorter operating times in VR settings (MD \\u22121.40 minutes, 95% CI \\u22121.96 to \\u22120.84; 1 study, n = 60) and similar times in wet laboratory settings (MD 0.16 minutes, 95% CI \\u22120.50 to 0.82; 1 study, n = 60). This study also found the VR\\u2010trained trainees had higher VR simulator ratings (MD 5.17, 95% CI 0.61 to 9.73; 1 study, n = 60). Results for supervising physician ratings in the operating room were inconsistent: one study reported that VR\\u2010 and wet laboratory\\u2010trained trainees received similar supervising physician ratings for cataract surgery (P = 0.608); another study reported that VR\\u2010trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training were less likely to receive poor ratings by supervising physicians for capsulorhexis construction (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.57). In wet laboratory settings, VR\\u2010trained trainees received similar supervising physician ratings compared with wet laboratory\\u2010trained trainees (MD \\u22121.50, 95% CI \\u22126.77 to 3.77; n = 60) and higher supervising physician ratings compared with trainees without supplementary training (P < 0.0001). However, the results for all secondary outcomes should be interpreted with caution because of very low\\u2010certainty evidence.\\u00a0 \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nCurrent research suggests that VR training may be more effective than no supplementary training in improving trainee performance in the operating room and simulated settings for postgraduate ophthalmology trainees, but the evidence is uncertain. The evidence comparing VR with conventional or wet laboratory training was less consistent. \\n\",\n          \"Background\\nVitamin D deficiency during pregnancy increases the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and low birthweight. In a previous Cochrane Review we found that supplementing pregnant women with vitamin D alone compared to no vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and low birthweight and may increase the risk of preterm births if it is combined with calcium. However the effects of different vitamin D regimens are not yet clear. \\nObjectives\\nTo assess the effects and safety of different regimens of vitamin D supplementation alone or in combination with calcium or other vitamins, minerals or nutrients during pregnancy, specifically doses of 601 international units per day (IU/d) or more versus 600 IU/d or less; and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less. \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth\\u2019s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (12 July 2018), and the reference lists of retrieved studies. \\nSelection criteria\\nRandomised trials evaluating the effect of different vitamin D regimens (dose, frequency, duration, and time of commencement of supplementation during pregnancy), alone or in combination with other nutrients on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes. We only included trials that compared 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less. We did not include in the analysis groups that received no vitamin D, as that comparison is assessed in another Cochrane Review. \\nData collection and analysis\\nTwo review authors independently: i) assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria; ii) extracted data from included studies, and iii) assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. Our primary maternal outcomes were: pre\\u2010eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and any adverse effects; our primary infant outcomes were preterm birth and low birthweight. Data were checked for accuracy. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. \\nMain results\\nIn this review, we included data from 30 trials involving 7289 women. We excluded 11 trials, identified 16 ongoing/unpublished trials and two trials are awaiting classification. Overall risk of bias for the trials was mixed. \\nComparison 1. 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less of vitamin D alone or with any other nutrient (19 trials; 5214 participants) \\nSupplementation with 601 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia (risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.42); 5 trials; 1553 participants,low\\u2010certainty evidence), may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.86; 5 trials; 1846 participants; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence), may make little or no difference to the risk of preterm birth (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.69; 4 trials; 2294 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence); and may make little or no difference to the risk of low birthweight (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.24; 4 trials; 1550 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) compared to women receiving 600 IU/d or less. \\nComparison 2. 4000 IU or more versus 3999 IU or less of vitamin D alone (15 trials; 4763 participants) \\nSupplementation with 4000 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of: pre\\u2010eclampsia (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.22; 4 trials, 1903 participants, low\\u2010certainty evidence); gestational diabetes (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.42; 5 trials, 2276 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence); preterm birth (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.12; 6 trials, 2948 participants, low\\u2010certainty evidence); and low birthweight (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.70; 2 trials; 1099 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence) compared to women receiving 3999 IU/d or less. \\nAdverse events (such as hypercalcaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypercalciuria, and hypovitaminosis D) were reported differently in most trials; however, in general, there was little to no side effects reported or similar cases between groups. \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nSupplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes; however, it may make little or no difference to the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, preterm birth and low birthweight. Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current upper limit for vitamin D seems not to increase the risk of the outcomes evaluated. In general, the GRADE was considered low certainty for most of the primary outcomes due to serious risk of bias and imprecision of results. With respect to safety, it appears that vitamin D supplementation is a safe intervention during pregnancy, although the parameters used to determine this were either not reported or not consistent between trials. Future trials should be consistent in their reports of adverse events. There are 16 ongoing trials that when published, will increase the body of knowledge. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"simplified_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"## Plain Title\\nStudy on a Drug for Crohn's Disease\\n\\n## Rationale\\nCrohn's disease makes the gut swell.

This surgery helps people see better when their eye lens gets cloudy. Learning this surgery is a big part of training for new eye doctors.\\n\\nThis training is very important. New doctors need to learn how to do the surgery well and safely. Many training programs use special virtual reality (VR) tools to help. VR training lets doctors practice without real patients.\\n\\nWe wanted to see if VR training truly helps new eye doctors perform better. We looked at how fast they did surgery and if they had fewer problems. We also checked what their teachers thought of their skills. We think VR training could be a good way to teach new doctors. It gives them a safe place to learn and get better.\\n\\n### Trial Design\\n\\nThis study looked at how different studies were set up. It was a review of studies where people were put into groups by chance. This is called a \\\"randomized controlled trial.\\\"\\n\\nThese studies looked at new eye doctors after medical school. They were learning to do cataract surgery. The studies compared VR training to other ways of learning. This included practicing on models, learning from books, or having no extra training.\\n\\nDoctors in these studies ranged in age, but no specific ages were given. Both male and female doctors were included. The studies came from different parts of the world. We looked at how long it took doctors to do surgery and if they had problems during or after surgery. Teachers also rated their skills. The time a person was in any one study varied.\\n\\n### Results\\n\\nWe looked at six studies that included 151 new eye doctors. These doctors were training to do cataract surgery. The studies came from different countries like the US, China, and Germany.\\n\\nSome studies compared VR training to practicing on models. Other studies compared VR training to no extra training.\\n\\nThe results were not always clear. It was hard to be sure about the benefits of VR training. This is because the studies were set up in different ways.\\n\\nOne study showed that doctors with VR training, compared to those with no extra training, did surgery faster. They took about 17 minutes less. One study also found that doctors with VR training had fewer problems during surgery.\\n\\nWhen comparing VR training to practicing on models, the results were mixed. Some studies found similar times for both groups. One study even found VR training took longer.\\n\\nFor practice in a VR setting, doctors with VR training did surgery faster than those with no extra training. They also did better on VR tasks.\\n\\nTeachers' ratings of doctors in real surgery were not always clear. Some studies found similar ratings for VR training and model practice. One study found that teachers gave better ratings to VR-trained doctors compared to those with no extra training.\\n\\nOverall, the studies suggest that VR training might help new eye doctors. It might make them faster and have fewer problems, especially when compared to no extra training. But we need more clear studies to be sure.\",\n          \"## Plain Language Summary\\n\\n### Plain Title\\nVitamin D for Pregnant Women: How Much is Best?\\n\\n### Rationale\\nDuring pregnancy, some women do not have enough vitamin D. This is called vitamin D deficiency. This can lead to serious health problems for both mom and baby. These problems include:\\n\\n*   **Pre-eclampsia:** This is high blood pressure during pregnancy. It can harm the mother and baby.\\n*   **Gestational diabetes:** This is high blood sugar that starts during pregnancy.\\n*   **Preterm birth:** This is when a baby is born too early.\\n*   **Low birthweight:** This is when a baby weighs too little at birth.\\n\\nWe know that taking vitamin D may help reduce some of these risks. But we are not sure what amount of vitamin D is best. We also want to know if certain amounts are safe. This study looked at different amounts of vitamin D. It compared them to see what worked best and was safest.\\n\\n### Trial Design\\nThis study was a large review of many other studies. It gathered information from 30 studies. These studies included 7,289 pregnant women. All women in these studies took some amount of vitamin D. Some women also took calcium or other vitamins.\\n\\nWe looked at two main things:\\n1.  Did taking more than 600 units of vitamin D each day make a difference?\\n2.  Did taking more than 3,999 units of vitamin D each day make a difference?\\n\\nWe wanted to see how these amounts affected pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and low birthweight. We also looked for any bad side effects. The studies lasted for the full term of the pregnancy.\\n\\n### Results\\nWe found some important things:\\n\\n**Taking more than 600 units of vitamin D each day:**\\n*   It may help lower the risk of gestational diabetes. This is a good benefit for moms.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of pre-eclampsia.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of preterm birth.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of low birthweight.\\n\\n**Taking more than 3,999 units of vitamin D each day:**\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of pre-eclampsia.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of gestational diabetes.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of preterm birth.\\n*   It did not seem to change the risk of low birthweight.\\n\\nOverall, vitamin D seems safe for pregnant women. There were few or no bad side effects reported. When side effects did happen, they were similar in all groups.\\n\\n**What we learned:**\\nTaking more vitamin D than what is usually suggested may lower the risk of gestational diabetes. But it did not seem to help with other problems like pre-eclampsia or early birth. Even taking high amounts of vitamin D did not seem to cause more problems. More studies are ongoing. They will give us more clear answers in the future.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pls_text_content\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Methotrexate for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease\\nAlthough corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission of Crohn's disease, many patients relapse when steroids are withdrawn or become steroid dependent. Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant side effects. Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug that is used to treat active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. This review includes seven randomized trials with a total of 495 participants. There is evidence from one large study which suggests that methotrexate (25 mg/week) injected intramuscularly for 16 weeks among patients with active treatment resistant Crohn's disease may provide a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids. This reduction in steroid use could reduce steroid\\u2010induced side effects for people with chronic Crohn's disease. Although side effects are more common with high dose methotrexate therapy, no serious side effects have been observed. Common side effects associated with methotrexate therapy include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash and headache. Studies comparing lower dose oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) to placebo (e.g. sugar pill) or other active drugs (e.g. azathioprine or 6\\u2010mercaptopurine) indicate that lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any benefit for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. However, these trials were small in size and further studies of oral methotrexate may be justified. Two studies looked at the combination of methotrexate and infliximab (a biological drug) compared to infliximab therapy alone. These studies indicated that the addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infiximab. However these studies were relatively small and further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies. \\n\",\n          \"Can virtual reality training for cataract surgery supplement or replace other training methods for ophthalmology trainees? \\nKey messagesWe did not find enough evidence to show that virtual reality (VR) training improves cataract surgery performance among ophthalmology trainees compared to wet lab or conventional training. \\nWhat is virtual reality training?VR training uses computer technology to simulate a three\\u2010dimensional interactive environment. \\nHow does cataract surgery training work in ophthalmology trainees?Most postgraduate ophthalmology trainees in the United States (US) transition gradually from performing specific cataract surgery (replacing the cloudy lens inside the eye with an artificial one) steps in a wet laboratory (practicing on cadaver or artificial tissues) or using VR simulators to performing cataract surgery in the operating room. \\nWhy is this question important?VR training is becoming increasingly common in postgraduate ophthalmology training, but comprehensive reviews of the impact of VR training on trainees\\u2019\\u00a0cataract surgery performance are lacking. \\nWhat did we want to find out?The primary aim of this review was to determine whether VR training improved operating room performance (measured by operating time in the operating room, intraoperative [during the operation] complications, or postoperative [after the operation] complications) in cataract surgery for postgraduate ophthalmology trainees. The secondary aim was to identify the impact of VR training on operating time in simulated settings, supervising physician ratings in the operating room or simulator settings, or VR simulation task ratings. \\nHow did we identify and evaluate the evidence?We searched for studies that compared VR training to other training methods such as traditional wet laboratory training or no supplementary training in a postgraduate\\u00a0ophthalmology trainee population. \\nWhat did we find?VR relative to conventional or wet laboratory training did not impact operating times, the rate of intraoperative complications, or supervising physician ratings in the operating room. However, compared to trainees without supplementary training, VR\\u2010trained trainees received higher supervising physician ratings in the operating room. The quality of evidence for all outcomes was very low. \\nWhat does this mean?VR training is a promising intervention for teaching cataract surgery, but more rigorous, evidence\\u2010based studies are needed to gauge its impact on key outcomes such as intraoperative and postoperative complications.\\u00a0 \\nHow up\\u2010to\\u2010date is the evidence?The evidence is current up to 14 June 2021. \\n\",\n          \"Regimens of vitamin D supplementation for women during pregnancy\\nWhat is the issue? \\nThis review evaluated if there are beneficial effects of supplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation (200 international units/day (IU/d) to 600 IU/d) on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes and to evaluate if there are negative health effects when using more than the current upper limit recommendation (4000 IU/d). \\nWhy is this important? \\nVitamin D supplementation in pregnancy compared to no supplementation appears to decrease the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birthweight and may reduce the risk of severe postpartum haemorrhage. However, it is not clear if doses greater than the currently recommended level are needed to observe these health benefits, and if giving more than the upper limit is related to adverse events. \\nWhat was studied in the review? \\nThis review included trials evaluating the effect of different vitamin D regimens (doses, frequencies, duration, and times of commencement) to compare the effects of 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less, of vitamin D alone or with any other nutrient on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes. \\nWhat evidence did we find? \\nEvidence from 19 trials involving 5214 women suggest that supplementation with 601 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes but may make little or no difference to the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, preterm birth or low birthweight compared to women receiving 600 IU/d or less. \\nEvidence from 15 trials involving 4763 women suggests that supplementation with 4000 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of pre\\u2010eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth or low birthweight compared to women receiving 3999 IU/d or less. \\nAdverse events were reported differently in most trials; in general, there was little to no side effects reported or similar cases between groups. \\nWhat does this mean? \\nSupplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes; however, it may make little or no difference in the risk of the other outcomes. Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current upper limit for vitamin D seems not to increase the risk of the outcomes evaluated. Vitamin D supplementation appears to be safe. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertscore\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.01021543258078406,\n        \"min\": 0.8163706660270691,\n        \"max\": 0.8387226462364197,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8387226462364197,\n          0.8167865872383118,\n          0.8343364596366882\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"alignscore\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.10150941008369728,\n        \"min\": 0.3701719641685486,\n        \"max\": 0.6205008625984192,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.6205008625984192,\n          0.3701719641685486,\n          0.5978964567184448\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"flesch_kincaid_grade\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.3545327998942411,\n        \"min\": 3.39843670348343,\n        \"max\": 6.376857549632209,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3.39843670348343,\n          6.376857549632209,\n          5.721094224924013\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"coleman_liau_index\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.384465834813746,\n        \"min\": 5.5012345679012356,\n        \"max\": 8.975464684014874,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          6.846728971962619,\n          8.975464684014874,\n          7.259999999999998\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"flesch_reading_ease\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 6.63041182406559,\n        \"min\": 69.73173099738989,\n        \"max\": 85.04273437500004,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          82.2477386009629,\n          69.73173099738989,\n          73.97666666666669\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"gunning_fog_index\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.9272479266711435,\n        \"min\": 4.369640328518833,\n        \"max\": 8.220871327254306,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4.369640328518833,\n          7.627050541801788,\n          8.220871327254306\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"smog_index\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.5766794348518487,\n        \"min\": 5.894771397915884,\n        \"max\": 9.236282656511921,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          6.351523495107088,\n          8.780745627414403,\n          9.236282656511921\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"dale_chall_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.1200277304363675,\n        \"min\": 7.222785670194003,\n        \"max\": 10.220897389860003,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          9.602704559614839,\n          10.220897389860003,\n          9.096526342451874\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
