This review identified two randomised controlled trials including a total of 90 participants. One study compared twice weekly treatment with helminths (an 0.8 mL solution containing 2500 live eggs of the helminth Trichuris suis) for 12 weeks to a matching placebo (an 0.8 ml identical looking solution with no Trichuris suis eggs) in 54 patients with active ulcerative colitis. Few remissions occurred during the trial and helminth treatment had no detectable effect on these remissions. Ten per cent (3/30) of patients in the helminth group achieved remission compared to four per cent (1/24) of placebo patients. A higher proportion of patients in the helminth group (43% or 13/30) improved clinically compared to the placebo group (17% or 4/24). However, this difference could be a chance effect. We could not determine whether the proportion of patients who had a side effect was higher in either group. No observed side effects were thought to be related to treatment were reported in this study. The other study compared one treatment with various doses of helminths (a solution of 500, 2500 or 7500 Trichuris suis eggs) to a matching placebo in 36 patients with Crohn's disease. This study was designed to assess side effects and did not measure clinical remission or improvement. There amount of information available on side\\u2010effects at two weeks was limited and the results were uncertain due to the small number of participants in the study. The only side effect that was judged to be possibly related to the study treatment was dysgeusia (a distortion of the sense of taste). This was reported in one patient in the helminth group and in one patient in the placebo group. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to allow any firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness and safety of helminths used to treat patients with IBD. The only information available relating to clinical improvement in patients with active ulcerative colitis comes from one small study. We do not know how safe helminths are when used in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Further randomised controlled trials are required to assess the efficacy and safety of helminth therapy in IBD.\",\n          \"Benzodiazepines alone or in combination with antipsychotic drugs for acute psychosis\\nReview question \\nThe aim of this review was to compare the tranquillising (calming) or sedative (sleepiness) effects of benzodiazepines, given alone or combined with other drugs compared with the effect of placebo (a pretend treatment), other drugs or non\\u2010drug treatments for people who are aggressive or agitated because they are experiencing psychoses. \\nBackground \\nAcute psychosis is a rapid worsening of a person\\u2019s mental state where touch with reality is often lost. People may experience frightening delusions or hallucinations which are distressing and may cause agitated or aggressive behaviour. In urgent cases, this agitation or aggression may cause harm to the person experiencing the psychoses or others around them. To avoid such harm, rapid tranquillisation or sedation with medicines may be required. The most common medicines used to achieve a state of calmness or sedation are benzodiazepines and these can be given either alone or in combination with antipsychotics. \\nSearching \\nThe original search for this review was carried out in January 2012 and subsequently two further update searches were run in August 2015 and August 2016. In total, these searches found 2497 records, which the review authors checked for inclusion or exclusion from the review. Authors included records only if they were randomised trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that allocated people with acute psychosis who presented with agitation, violence aggressive behaviour (or a combination of these) to receive benzodiazepines either given alone or combined with any antipsychotics, versus placebo, antipsychotics alone or in combination with other antipsychotics/benzodiazepines/antihistamines or non\\u2010drug treatments. \\nEvidence found \\nIn total, 20 trials were included. Overall, the quality of evidence was low or very low due to serious risk of bias and very small size of included trials. There was no clear difference in improvement between benzodiazepines and placebo, benzodiazepines and antipsychotics or benzodiazepines plus antipsychotics and benzodiazepines alone or antipsychotic alone. When benzodiazepines were compared with combined antipsychotics/antihistamines, there was a higher risk of no improvement in people receiving benzodiazepine alone but the evidence was of low quality. Only one study showed lower effect of combined benzodiazepines/antipsychotics versus combined antihistamines/antipsychotics. However, the evidence was of very low quality. In terms of side effects, people receiving benzodiazepines compared to antipsychotics had lower risk of presenting with symptoms such as shaking, tremors and slurred speech whereas the results for the sedation caused were unclear. \\nConclusions \\nThe existing trials are not informative enough to support or refute the use of benzodiazepines alone or in additional to other medicines when urgent tranquillisation or sedation with medicines is required. Although benzodiazepines alone may cause fewer side effects compared to older antipsychotics, when they are added on to other medicines this may lead to unnecessary side effects. Further studies are needed to provide good\\u2010quality evidence with robust conclusions to inform clinical practice and policies around rapid tranquillisation for people with psychoses who are aggressive or agitated.\",\n          \"Effectiveness of angioplasty compared with stenting in atherosclerotic disease of the iliac arteries \\nBackground \\nAtherosclerosis in the iliac artery (main pelvic artery towards the leg) may result in narrowing or obstruction (occlusion), leading to reduced blood flow to the leg. This is called iliac artery occlusive disease. Iliac artery occlusive disease may lead to symptoms of pain in the legs when walking (intermittent claudication), pain at rest, or ulcers of the foot or leg. A range of surgical and endovascular (from inside the artery, e.g. angioplasty) treatment options are available. Open surgical procedures have excellent patency rates (percentage of the vessels that remain open) but at the cost of substantial illness and death. Endovascular treatment has good safety and short\\u2010term effectiveness with decreased illness, complications and costs compared with open surgical procedures. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA; dilation of the artery with a balloon) and stenting (insertion of a small mesh tube) are widely used endovascular treatment options for iliac artery occlusive disease. A narrowing or obstruction of the iliac artery can be treated successfully by PTA alone. If PTA alone is not successful, an additional stent can be placed. Alternatively, a stent could be placed on its own to treat an iliac narrowing or obstruction (this is called primary stenting (PS)). However, there is limited evidence to prove which endovascular treatment strategy is better for lesions that restrict the iliac arteries. This review investigates whether it is better to place a stent in the first instance, or only under particular circumstances. \\nStudy characteristics and key results \\nWe found no new studies for this update. Previously, we had identified two studies with a combined total of 397 participants relevant to this topic. Combining the data was not possible due to the differences between the two included studies. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to 24 September 2019. \\nFor the following outcomes of interest, no clear differences emerged between the two types of treatment: technical success of the procedure, improvement in the severity of the arterial occlusive disease, or patency of the treated vessel. However, in one study, which only included iliac artery occlusions, fewer complications were observed in the group of participants treated with PS. Neither study reported on delayed complications. One study reported on reintervention, and resolution of symptoms and signs, with no evidence of a difference detected between the PS group and the PTA group. Neither study reported on improvement in walking distance. More research on this subject is necessary. \\nReliability of the evidence \\nBoth studies had some risk of bias relating to selective reporting and non\\u2010blinding of participants and personnel. Both studies occurred in the 1990s and techniques have since evolved. We considered the overall certainty of the evidence to be low due to this risk of bias, the small number of included studies and the differences in the types of patients that were included.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"non_pls\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Two RCTs (90 participants) were included. One trial assessed the efficacy and safety of Trichuris suis (T. suis) ova in patients with UC (n = 54). The other RCT was a phase one that assessed the safety and tolerability of T. suis ova in patients with CD (n = 36). The risk of bias in both studies was judged to be low. In the UC study, during the 12\\u2010week study period, participants in the active arm received 2\\u2010weekly aliquots of 2500 T. suis eggs, added to 0.8 mL of saline; those in the placebo arm received 0.8 mL saline only. There were sparse data available for the outcomes clinical remission and clinical improvement. Ten per cent (3/30) of patients in the T. suis arm entered remission compared to 4% (1/24) of patients in the placebo arm (RR 2.40, 95% CI 0.27 to 21.63). Forty\\u2010three per cent (13/30) of patients in the T. suis group achieved clinical improvement compared to 17% (4/24) of placebo patients (RR 2.60, 95% CI 0.97 to 6.95). The mean ulcerative colitis disease activity index (UCDAI) score was lower in the T. suis group (6.1 +/\\u2010 0.61) compared to the placebo group (7.5 +/\\u2010 0.66) after 12 weeks of treatment (MD \\u20101.40, 95% CI \\u20101.75 to \\u20101.05). There was only limited evidence relating to the proportion of patients who experienced an adverse event. Three per cent (1/30) of patients in the T. suis group experienced at least one adverse event compared to 12% (3/24) of placebo patients (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.40). None of the adverse events reported in this study were judged to be related to the study treatment. GRADE analyses rated the overall quality of the evidence for the primary and secondary outcomes (i.e. clinical remission and improvement) as low due to serious imprecision. In the CD study, participants received a single treatment of T. suis ova at a dosage of 500 (n = 9), 2500 (n = 9), or 7500 (n = 9) embryonated eggs or matching placebo (n = 9). The CD study did not assess clinical remission or improvement as outcomes. There were sparse data on adverse events at two weeks. Thirty\\u2010seven per cent (10/27) of patients in the T. suis group experienced at least one adverse event compared to 44% (4/9) of placebo patients (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.01). Only one adverse event (dysgeusia) was judged to be possibly related to treatment in this study. Dysgeusia was reported in one patient in the T. suis group and in one patient in the placebo group.\",\n          \"Background\\nAcute psychotic illness, especially when associated with agitated or violent behaviour, can require urgent pharmacological tranquillisation or sedation. In several countries, clinicians often use benzodiazepines (either alone or in combination with antipsychotics) for this outcome. \\nObjectives\\nTo examine whether benzodiazepines, alone or in combination with other pharmacological agents, is an effective treatment for psychosis\\u2010induced aggression or agitation when compared with placebo, other pharmacological agents (alone or in combination) or non\\u2010pharmacological approaches. \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register (January 2012, 20 August 2015 and 3 August 2016), inspected reference lists of included and excluded studies, and contacted authors of relevant studies. \\nSelection criteria\\nWe included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing benzodiazepines alone or in combination with any antipsychotics, versus antipsychotics alone or in combination with any other antipsychotics, benzodiazepines or antihistamines, for people who were aggressive or agitated due to psychosis. \\nData collection and analysis\\nWe reliably selected studies, quality assessed them and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated standard estimates of risk ratio (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed\\u2010effect model. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) between groups. If there was heterogeneity, this was explored using a random\\u2010effects model. We assessed risk of bias and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. \\nMain results\\nTwenty trials including 695 participants are now included in the review. The trials compared benzodiazepines or benzodiazepines plus an antipsychotic with placebo, antipsychotics, antihistamines, or a combination of these. The quality of evidence for the main outcomes was low or very low due to very small sample size of included studies and serious risk of bias (randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding were not well conducted in the included trials, 30% of trials (six out of 20) were supported by pharmaceutical institutes). There was no clear effect for most outcomes. \\nBenzodiazepines versus placebo\\nOne trial compared benzodiazepines with placebo. There was no difference in the number of participants sedated at 24 hours (very low quality evidence). However, for the outcome of global state, clearly more people receiving placebo showed no improvement in the medium term (one to\\u00a048 hours) (n = 102, 1 RCT, RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.97, very low quality evidence).  Benzodiazepines versus antipsychotics \\nWhen compared with haloperidol, there was no observed effect for benzodiazepines for sedation by 16 hours (n = 434, 8 RCTs, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.54, low quality evidence). There was no difference in the number of participants who had not improved in the medium term (n = 188, 5 RCTs, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.11, low quality evidence). However, one small study found fewer participants improved when receiving benzodiazepines compared with olanzapine (n = 150, 1 RCT, RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.18, very low quality evidence). People receiving benzodiazepines were less likely to experience\\u00a0extrapyramidal\\u00a0effects in the medium term compared to people receiving haloperidol (n = 233, 6 RCTs, RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.41, low quality evidence). \\nBenzodiazepines versus combined antipsychotics/antihistamines\\nWhen benzodiazepine was compared with combined antipsychotics/antihistamines (haloperidol plus promethazine), there was a higher risk of no improvement in people receiving benzodiazepines in the medium term (n = 200, 1 RCT, RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.05, low quality evidence). However, for sedation, the results were controversial between two groups: lorazepam may lead to lower risk of sedation than combined antipsychotics/antihistamines (n = 200, 1 RCT, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.98, low quality evidence); while, midazolam may lead to higher risk of sedation than combined antipsychotics/antihistamines (n = 200, 1 RCT, RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.23, low quality evidence). \\nOther combinations\\nData comparing benzodiazepines plus antipsychotics versus benzodiazepines alone did not yield any results with clear differences; all were very low quality evidence. When comparing combined benzodiazepines/antipsychotics (all studies compared haloperidol) with the same antipsychotics alone (haloperidol), there was no difference between groups in improvement in the medium term (n = 185, 4\\u00a0RCTs, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.46, low quality evidence), but sedation was more likely in people who received the combination therapy (n = 172, 3\\u00a0RCTs, RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.67,very low quality evidence). Only one study compared combined benzodiazepine/antipsychotics with antipsychotics; however, this study did not report our primary outcomes. One small study compared combined benzodiazepines/antipsychotics with combined antihistamines/antipsychotics. Results showed a higher risk of no clinical improvement (n = 60, 1 RCT, RR 25.00, 95% CI 1.55 to 403.99, very low quality evidence) and sedation status (n = 60, 1 RCT, RR 12.00, 95% CI 1.66 to 86.59, very low quality evidence) in the combined benzodiazepines/antipsychotics group. \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nThe evidence from RCTs for the use of benzodiazepines alone is not good. There were relatively few good data. Most trials were too small to highlight differences in either positive or negative effects. Adding a benzodiazepine to other drugs does not seem to confer clear advantage and has potential for adding unnecessary adverse effects. Sole use of older antipsychotics unaccompanied by anticholinergic drugs seems difficult to justify. Much more high\\u2010quality research is still needed in this area.\",\n          \"There was no evidence of a difference following percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with selective stenting compared to primary stenting (PS) in technical success rates in either the study involving stenotic lesions (odds ratio (OR) 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 2.99; 279 participants; low certainty evidence); or the study involving iliac artery occlusions (OR 2.95, 95% CI 0.12 to 73.90; 112 participants; low certainty evidence). In one trial, PTA of iliac artery occlusions resulted in a higher rate of major complications, especially distal embolisation (OR 4.50 95% CI 1.18 to 17.14; 1 study, 112 participants; low certainty evidence). Immediate complications were similar in the second study (OR 1.81, 95% CI 0.64 to 5.13; 1 study, 279 participants; low certainty evidence). Neither study reported on delayed complications. No evidence of a difference was seen in symptomatic improvement (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.27; 1 study, 157 participants; low certainty evidence). The second study did not provide data but reported no differences. For the outcome of patency, no evidence of a difference was seen in the study involving iliac occlusion at two years (OR 1.60, 95% CI 0.34 to 7.44; 1 study, 57 participants; low certainty evidence); or the study involving stenotic lesions at two years (71.3% in the PS group versus 69.9% in the PTA group). Only one study reported on reintervention (six to eight years, OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.23; 1 study, 279 participants; low certainty evidence); and resolution of symptoms and signs (12 months, OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.00; 1 study, 219 participants; low certainty evidence), with no evidence of a difference detected in either outcome.

      "Background\n",
      "Infection with the protozoan Entamoeba histolytica is common in low‐ and middle‐income countries, and up to 100,000 people with severe disease die every year. Adequate therapy for amoebic colitis is necessary to reduce illness, prevent development of complicated disease and extraintestinal spread, and decrease transmission. \n",
      "Objectives\n",
      "To evaluate antiamoebic drugs for treating amoebic colitis.\n",
      "Search methods\n",
      "We searched the available literature up to 22 March 2018. We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, mRCT, and conference proceedings. We contacted individual researchers, organizations, and pharmaceutical companies, and we checked reference lists. \n",
      "Selection criteria\n",
      "Randomized controlled trials of antiamoebic drugs given alone or in combination, compared with placebo or another antiamoebic drug, for treating adults and children with a diagnosis of amoebic colitis. \n",
      "Data collection and analysis\n",
      "Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and methodological quality of trials and extracted and analysed the data. We calculated clinical and parasitological failure rates and rates of relapse and adverse events as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using a random‐effects model. We determined statistical heterogeneity and explored possible sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analyses. We carried out sensitivity analysis by using trial quality to assess the robustness of reported results. \n",
      "Main results\n",
      "In total, 41 trials (4999 participants) met the inclusion criteria of this review. In this update, we added four trials to the 37 trials included in the first published review version. Thirty trials were published over 20 years ago. Only one trial used adequate methods of randomization and allocation concealment, was blinded, and analysed all randomized participants. Only one trial used an E histolytica stool antigen test, and two trials used amoebic culture. \n",
      "Tinidazole may be more effective than metronidazole for reducing clinical failure (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.51; 477 participants, eight trials; low‐certainty evidence) and is probably associated with fewer adverse events (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.92; 477 participants, 8 trials; moderate‐certainty evidence). Compared with metronidazole, combination therapy may result in fewer parasitological failures (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.86; 720 participants, 3 trials; low‐certainty evidence), but we are uncertain which combination is more effective than another. Evidence is insufficient to allow conclusions regarding the efficacy of other antiamoebic drugs. \n",
      "Authors' conclusions\n",
      "Compared with metronidazole, tinidazole may be more effective in reducing clinical failure and may be associated with fewer adverse events. Combination drug therapy may be more effective for reducing parasitological failure compared with metronidazole alone. However, these results are based mostly on small trials conducted over 20 years ago with a variety of poorly defined outcomes. Tests that detect E histolytica more accurately are needed, particularly in countries where concomitant infection with other bacteria and parasites is common.\n",

Atherectomy is an alternative procedure, in which atheroma is cut or ground away within the artery. This is the first update of a Cochrane Review published in 2014. \\nObjectives\\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of atherectomy for peripheral arterial disease compared to other established treatments. \\nSearch methods\\nThe Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED) databases, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 12 August 2019. \\nSelection criteria\\nWe included all randomised controlled trials that compared atherectomy with other established treatments. All participants had symptomatic PAD with either claudication or critical limb ischaemia and evidence of lower limb arterial disease. \\nData collection and analysis\\nTwo review authors screened studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and used GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence. We resolved any disagreements through discussion. Outcomes of interest were: primary patency (at six and 12 months), all\\u2010cause mortality, fatal and non\\u2010fatal cardiovascular events, initial technical failure rates, target vessel revascularisation rates (TVR; at six and 12 months); and complications. \\nMain results\\nWe included seven studies, with a total of 527 participants and 581 treated lesions. We found two comparisons: atherectomy versus balloon angioplasty (BA) and atherectomy versus BA with primary stenting. No studies compared atherectomy with bypass surgery. Overall, the evidence from this review was of very low certainty, due to a high risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency. \\nSix studies (372 participants, 427 treated lesions) compared atherectomy versus BA. We found no clear difference between atherectomy and BA for the primary outcomes: six\\u2010month primary patency rates (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 1.20; 3 studies, 186 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence); 12\\u2010month primary patency rates (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.84; 2 studies, 149 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) or mortality rates (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.66, 3 studies, 210 participants, very low\\u2010certainty evidence). One study reported cardiac failure and acute coronary syndrome as causes of death at 24 months but it was unclear which arm the participants belonged to, and one study reported no cardiovascular events. \\nThere was no clear difference when examining: initial technical failure rates (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.08; 6 studies, 425 treated vessels; very low\\u2010certainty evidence), six\\u2010month TVR (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.06 to 4.42; 2 studies, 136 treated vessels; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) or 12\\u2010month TVR (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.42; 3 studies, 176 treated vessels; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). All six studies reported complication rates (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.68; 6 studies, 387 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) and embolisation events (RR 2.51, 95% CI 0.64 to 9.80; 6 studies, 387 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). Atherectomy may be less likely to cause dissection (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.54; 4 studies, 290 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) and may be associated with a reduction in bailout stenting (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.74; 4 studies, 315 treated vessels; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). Four studies reported amputation rates, with only one amputation event recorded in a BA participant. We used subgroup analysis to compare the effect of plain balloons/stents and drug\\u2010eluting balloons/stents, but did not detect any differences between the subgroups. \\nOne study (155 participants, 155 treated lesions) compared atherectomy versus BA and primary stenting, so comparison was extremely limited and subject to imprecision. This study did not report primary patency. The study reported one death (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.23; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) and three complication events (RR 7.04, 95% CI 0.80 to 62.23; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) in a very small data set, making conclusions unreliable. We found no clear difference between the treatment arms in cardiovascular events (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.23; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). This study found no initial technical failure events, and TVR rates at six and 24 months showed little difference between treatment arms (RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.95 to 5.46; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence and RR 2.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 4.37; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence, respectively). \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nThis review update shows that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of atherectomy on patency, mortality and cardiovascular event rates compared to plain balloon angioplasty, with or without stenting. We detected no clear differences in initial technical failure rates or TVR, but there may be reduced dissection and bailout stenting after atherectomy although this is uncertain. Included studies were small, heterogenous and at high risk of bias. Larger studies powered to detect clinically meaningful, patient\\u2010centred outcomes are required.\",\n          \"The review included one trial involving 200 women and was at moderate to high risk of bias.The trial compared a daily dose of nitrofurantoin and close surveillance (regular clinic visit, urine cultures and antibiotics when a positive culture was found) with close surveillance only. No significant differences were found for the primary outcomes: recurrent pyelonephritis (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 2.53; one study, 167 women), RUTI before birth (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.38; one study, 167 women), and preterm birth (before 37 weeks) (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.35; one study, 147 women). The overall quality of evidence for these outcomes as assessed using GRADE was very low. There were no significant differences between the two comparison groups for any of the following secondary outcomes, birthweight less than 2500 (g) (RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.53 to 7.80; one study, 147 infants), birthweight (mean difference (MD) \\u2010113.00, 95% CI \\u2010327.20 to 101.20; one study, 147 infants), five\\u2010minute Apgar score less than seven (RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.87; one study, 147 infants) and miscarriages (RR 3.11, 95% CI 0.33 to 29.29; one study, 167 women). The evidence for these secondary outcomes was also of very low quality. The incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) (at least 103 colonies per mL) (secondary outcome), only reported in women with a clinic attendance rate of more than 90% (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.89; one study, 102 women), was significantly reduced in women who received nitrofurantoin and close surveillance. Data on total mortality and small\\u2010for\\u2010gestational\\u2010age babies were not reported.\",\n          \"Background\\nCancer increases the risk of thromboembolic events, especially in people receiving anticoagulation treatments. \\nObjectives\\nTo compare the efficacy and safety of low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), and other anticoagulants for the long\\u2010term treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in people with cancer. \\nSearch methods\\nWe conducted a literature search including a comprehensive electronic search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ), MEDLINE (Ovid), and Embase (Ovid); handsearching conference proceedings; checking references of included studies; and a search for ongoing studies in trial registries. As part of the living systematic review approach, we run searches continually, incorporating new evidence after it is identified. Last search date 14 May 2021. \\nSelection criteria\\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the benefits and harms of long\\u2010term treatment with LMWHs, DOACs, VKAs, or other anticoagulants in people with cancer and symptomatic VTE. \\nData collection and analysis\\nWe extracted data in duplicate on study characteristics and risk of bias. Outcomes included: all\\u2010cause mortality, recurrent VTE, major bleeding, minor bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and health\\u2010related quality of life (QoL). We assessed the certainty of the evidence at the outcome level following the GRADE approach (GRADE handbook). \\nMain results\\nOf 3583 citations,19 RCTs fulfilled the eligibility criteria.\\nLow molecular weight heparins versus vitamin K antagonistsEight studies enrolling 2327 participants compared LMWHs with VKAs. Meta\\u2010analysis of five studies probably did not rule out a beneficial or harmful effect of LMWHs compared to VKAs on mortality up to 12 months of follow\\u2010up (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.13; risk difference (RD) 0 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 45 fewer to 48 more; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence). Meta\\u2010analysis of four studies did not rule out a beneficial or harmful effect of LMWHs compared to VKAs on major bleeding (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.12; RD 4 more per 1000, 95% CI 19 fewer to 48 more, moderate\\u2010certainty evidence) or minor bleeding (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.27; RD 38 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 92 fewer to 47 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence), or thrombocytopenia (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.69). Meta\\u2010analysis of five studies showed that LMWHs probably reduced the recurrence of VTE compared to VKAs (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.77; RD 53 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 29 fewer to 72 fewer, moderate\\u2010certainty evidence). \\nDirect oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonistsFive studies enrolling 982 participants compared DOACs with VKAs. Meta\\u2010analysis of four studies may not rule out a beneficial or harmful effect of DOACs compared to VKAs on mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.21; RD 12 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 51 fewer to 37 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence), recurrent VTE (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.31; RD 14 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 27 fewer to 12 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence), major bleeding (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.57, RD 8 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 22 fewer to 20 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence), or minor bleeding (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.22; RD 21 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 54 fewer to 28 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence). One study reporting on DOAC versus VKA was published as abstract so is not included in the main analysis. \\nDirect oral anticoagulants versus low molecular weight heparinsTwo studies enrolling 1455 participants compared DOAC with LMWH. The study by Raskob did not rule out a beneficial or harmful effect of DOACs compared to LMWH on mortality up to 12 months of follow\\u2010up (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.25; RD 27 more per 1000, 95% CI 30 fewer to 95 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence). The data also showed that DOACs may have shown a likely reduction in VTE recurrence up to 12 months of follow\\u2010up compared to LMWH (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.01; RD 36 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 62 fewer to 1 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence). DOAC may have increased major bleeding at 12 months of follow\\u2010up compared to LMWH (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.88; RD 29 more per 1000, 95% CI 0 fewer to 78 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence) and likely increased minor bleeding up to 12 months of follow\\u2010up compared to LMWH (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.80; RD 35 more per 1000, 95% CI 6 fewer to 92 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence). The second study on DOAC versus LMWH was published as an abstract and is not included in the main analysis. \\nIdraparinux versus vitamin K antagonistsOne RCT with 284 participants compared once\\u2010weekly subcutaneous injection of idraparinux versus standard treatment (parenteral anticoagulation followed by warfarin or acenocoumarol) for three or six months. The data probably did not rule out a beneficial or harmful effect of idraparinux compared to VKAs on mortality at six months (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.59; RD 31 more per 1000, 95% CI 62 fewer to 167 more; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence), VTE recurrence at six months (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.32; RD 42 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 65 fewer to 25 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence) or major bleeding (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.35 to 3.56; RD 4 more per 1000, 95% CI 25 fewer to 98 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence). \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nFor the long\\u2010term treatment of VTE in people with cancer, evidence shows that LMWHs compared to VKAs probably produces an important reduction in VTE and DOACs compared to LMWH, may likely reduce VTE but may increase risk of major bleeding. Decisions for a person with cancer and VTE to start long\\u2010term LMWHs versus oral anticoagulation should balance benefits and harms and integrate the person's values and preferences for the important outcomes and alternative management strategies. \\nEditorial note: this is a living systematic review (LSR).

People with this condition can experience pain on walking, pain at rest, or leg ulceration due to poor blood supply. Treatment options are: surgery, using a blood vessel or graft to bypass the narrowed or blocked section of the artery; balloon angioplasty, when a deflated balloon is passed into the narrowing at the end of a wire, then blown up to stretch the artery; and stenting (used in addition to balloon angioplasty), which holds open the balloon\\u2010stretched section for extra support. A final option, less commonly used, is a technique called atherectomy. This treatment cuts or grinds away the fatty deposition (atheroma) within the artery that is causing the narrowing or occlusion. \\nKey results \\nIn this review, we compared atherectomy with the other treatment options described above. We also looked within the two groups to assess whether using drug\\u2010releasing balloons or stents impacted on participants' outcomes. We identified seven studies with a total of 527 participants. \\nSix trials compared atherectomy against balloon angioplasty (372 participants, 427 treated lesions). We found no clear difference between the procedures when examining artery patency at six and 12 months, risk of death, initial procedure failure rates, need to re\\u2010treat the artery, risk of forming clots (embolisation), complication rates or risk of amputation. We found that atherectomy was associated with lower rates of emergency stenting during the procedure and lower balloon inflation pressures when compared with balloon angioplasty alone. We found no difference in results depending on whether the balloons were drug\\u2010releasing or not. \\nOne study compared atherectomy against balloon angioplasty and primary stenting (155 participants and 155 treated lesions). This study did not report primary patency. We found no clear difference between the treatment arms in risk of death, complication rates, cardiovascular events and the need to re\\u2010treat the artery. This study found no initial procedure failure events, \\nWe did not find any studies that compared bypass surgery against atherectomy.\\nCertainty of the evidence \\nOverall, our certainty in the evidence is very low, which means we do not have confidence that our results show the true effect of the treatments. We downgraded our certainty in the evidence because the studies were at high risk of bias (lack of blinding of participants or assessors, several outcomes were not reported and a number of the participants did not complete the studies); the trials were all small; and their results were inconsistent. \\nConclusions \\nIn conclusion, we have found no clear difference in effect on patency, mortality or cardiovascular event rates when comparing atherectomy against balloon angioplasty with or without stenting. The limited evidence available does not support a significant advantage of atherectomy over conventional balloon angioplasty or stenting.\",\n          \"Interventions for preventing recurrent urinary tract infections during pregnancy\\nRecurrent urinary tract infections (RUTI) are common in women generally, and particularly in pregnant women. A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection of the urinary tract (bladder, kidneys) due to the presence of bacteria in the urine (bacteriuria). During pregnancy, UTI may be a serious complication that is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes for both mother and child including preterm birth and small\\u2010for\\u2010gestational\\u2010age babies. Therefore, it is important to define the optimal intervention for preventing RUTI during pregnancy to improve pregnancy outcomes. Interventions used to prevent RUTI in pregnant women can be pharmacological (antibiotics) or non\\u2010pharmacological (cranberry products, acupuncture, probiotics and behavioural modifications). So far, little is known about the best way to prevent RUTI in pregnant women. \\nThis review identified one study involving 200 pregnant women who received nitrofurantoin (antibiotics) and close surveillance (regular clinic visit, urine cultures and antibiotics when a positive culture was found) or close surveillance alone. Suppressive therapy with daily dose of nitrofurantoin and close surveillance was not shown to prevent RUTI compared with close surveillance alone but the evidence was of very low quality. A significant reduction of asymptomatic bacteriuria (presence of bacteria in the urine without the symptoms of a UTI) was found in women with a high clinic attendance rate who received nitrofurantoin and close surveillance. Due to lack of evidence no conclusions can be drawn. Future randomised controlled trials comparing different pharmacological and non\\u2010pharmacological interventions are necessary to assess the optimal intervention to prevent RUTI in women who are pregnant. Such trials should report on a comprehensive range of outcomes for both women and infants.\",\n          \"Blood thinners for the long\\u2010term treatment of blood clots in people with cancer\\nBackgroundPeople with cancer are at an increased risk of developing blood clots and might respond differently to different types of blood thinners (anticoagulants). \\nStudy characteristicsWe searched scientific databases for clinical trials looking at the effects of long\\u2010term treatment with different blood thinners on blood clot recurrence in people with cancer with a confirmed diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (a blood clot in the limbs) or pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in the lungs). We included trials with any type of cancer, and irrespective of the type of cancer treatment. The trials looked at survival, recurrent blood clot, bleeding and blood platelet levels (which are involved in blood clotting). The evidence was current to May 2021. \\nKey resultsWe found 18trials enrollingparticipants with cancer and blood clots. The studies found that low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs; a type of blood thinner that is injected into a vein) were superior to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; a type of blood thinner taken by mouth (oral)) in reducing the recurrence of blood clots. The available data did not provide a clear answer about the effects of these drugs on death and the side effect of bleeding. The studies also found that direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs; another type of blood thinner taken by mouth) might decrease the recurrence of blood clots compared to LMWH while increasing the risk of bleeding. There was no clear answer when comparing DOACs (a newer type of oral blood thinner) and VKAs (an older type of oral blood thinner) for death, blood clot recurrence and bleeding. \\nReliability of the evidenceWhen comparing LMWHs to VKAs, we judged the certainty of the evidence to be moderate for recurrent blood clots, death at one year and major bleeding, and low for minor bleeding. \\nWhen comparing DOACs to VKAs, we judged the certainty of the evidence to be low for death, recurrent blood clots and bleeding complications. \\nEditorial note: this is a living systematic review.

This is the first update of a Cochrane Review published in 2014. \\nObjectives\\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of atherectomy for peripheral arterial disease compared to other established treatments. \\nSearch methods\\nThe Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED) databases, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 12 August 2019. \\nSelection criteria\\nWe included all randomised controlled trials that compared atherectomy with other established treatments. All participants had symptomatic PAD with either claudication or critical limb ischaemia and evidence of lower limb arterial disease. \\nData collection and analysis\\nTwo review authors screened studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and used GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence. We resolved any disagreements through discussion. Outcomes of interest were: primary patency (at six and 12 months), all\\u2010cause mortality, fatal and non\\u2010fatal cardiovascular events, initial technical failure rates, target vessel revascularisation rates (TVR; at six and 12 months); and complications. \\nMain results\\nWe included seven studies, with a total of 527 participants and 581 treated lesions. We found two comparisons: atherectomy versus balloon angioplasty (BA) and atherectomy versus BA with primary stenting. No studies compared atherectomy with bypass surgery. Overall, the evidence from this review was of very low certainty, due to a high risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency. \\nSix studies (372 participants, 427 treated lesions) compared atherectomy versus BA. We found no clear difference between atherectomy and BA for the primary outcomes: six\\u2010month primary patency rates (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 1.20; 3 studies, 186 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence); 12\\u2010month primary patency rates (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.84; 2 studies, 149 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) or mortality rates (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.66, 3 studies, 210 participants, very low\\u2010certainty evidence). One study reported cardiac failure and acute coronary syndrome as causes of death at 24 months but it was unclear which arm the participants belonged to, and one study reported no cardiovascular events. \\nThere was no clear difference when examining: initial technical failure rates (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.08; 6 studies, 425 treated vessels; very low\\u2010certainty evidence), six\\u2010month TVR (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.06 to 4.42; 2 studies, 136 treated vessels; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) or 12\\u2010month TVR (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.42; 3 studies, 176 treated vessels; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). All six studies reported complication rates (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.68; 6 studies, 387 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) and embolisation events (RR 2.51, 95% CI 0.64 to 9.80; 6 studies, 387 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). Atherectomy may be less likely to cause dissection (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.54; 4 studies, 290 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) and may be associated with a reduction in bailout stenting (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.74; 4 studies, 315 treated vessels; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). Four studies reported amputation rates, with only one amputation event recorded in a BA participant. We used subgroup analysis to compare the effect of plain balloons/stents and drug\\u2010eluting balloons/stents, but did not detect any differences between the subgroups. \\nOne study (155 participants, 155 treated lesions) compared atherectomy versus BA and primary stenting, so comparison was extremely limited and subject to imprecision. This study did not report primary patency. The study reported one death (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.23; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) and three complication events (RR 7.04, 95% CI 0.80 to 62.23; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) in a very small data set, making conclusions unreliable. We found no clear difference between the treatment arms in cardiovascular events (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.23; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). This study found no initial technical failure events, and TVR rates at six and 24 months showed little difference between treatment arms (RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.95 to 5.46; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence and RR 2.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 4.37; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence, respectively). \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nThis review update shows that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of atherectomy on patency, mortality and cardiovascular event rates compared to plain balloon angioplasty, with or without stenting. We detected no clear differences in initial technical failure rates or TVR, but there may be reduced dissection and bailout stenting after atherectomy although this is uncertain. Included studies were small, heterogenous and at high risk of bias. Larger studies powered to detect clinically meaningful, patient\\u2010centred outcomes are required.\",\n          \"The review included one trial involving 200 women and was at moderate to high risk of bias.The trial compared a daily dose of nitrofurantoin and close surveillance (regular clinic visit, urine cultures and antibiotics when a positive culture was found) with close surveillance only. No significant differences were found for the primary outcomes: recurrent pyelonephritis (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 2.53; one study, 167 women), RUTI before birth (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.38; one study, 167 women), and preterm birth (before 37 weeks) (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.35; one study, 147 women). The overall quality of evidence for these outcomes as assessed using GRADE was very low. There were no significant differences between the two comparison groups for any of the following secondary outcomes, birthweight less than 2500 (g) (RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.53 to 7.80; one study, 147 infants), birthweight (mean difference (MD) \\u2010113.00, 95% CI \\u2010327.20 to 101.20; one study, 147 infants), five\\u2010minute Apgar score less than seven (RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.87; one study, 147 infants) and miscarriages (RR 3.11, 95% CI 0.33 to 29.29; one study, 167 women). The evidence for these secondary outcomes was also of very low quality. The incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) (at least 103 colonies per mL) (secondary outcome), only reported in women with a clinic attendance rate of more than 90% (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.89; one study, 102 women), was significantly reduced in women who received nitrofurantoin and close surveillance. Data on total mortality and small\\u2010for\\u2010gestational\\u2010age babies were not reported.\",\n          \"Background\\nCancer increases the risk of thromboembolic events, especially in people receiving anticoagulation treatments. \\nObjectives\\nTo compare the efficacy and safety of low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), and other anticoagulants for the long\\u2010term treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in people with cancer. \\nSearch methods\\nWe conducted a literature search including a comprehensive electronic search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ), MEDLINE (Ovid), and Embase (Ovid); handsearching conference proceedings; checking references of included studies; and a search for ongoing studies in trial registries. As part of the living systematic review approach, we run searches continually, incorporating new evidence after it is identified. Last search date 14 May 2021. \\nSelection criteria\\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the benefits and harms of long\\u2010term treatment with LMWHs, DOACs, VKAs, or other anticoagulants in people with cancer and symptomatic VTE. \\nData collection and analysis\\nWe extracted data in duplicate on study characteristics and risk of bias. Outcomes included: all\\u2010cause mortality, recurrent VTE, major bleeding, minor bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and health\\u2010related quality of life (QoL). We assessed the certainty of the evidence at the outcome level following the GRADE approach (GRADE handbook). \\nMain results\\nOf 3583 citations,19 RCTs fulfilled the eligibility criteria.\\nLow molecular weight heparins versus vitamin K antagonistsEight studies enrolling 2327 participants compared LMWHs with VKAs. Meta\\u2010analysis of five studies probably did not rule out a beneficial or harmful effect of LMWHs compared to VKAs on mortality up to 12 months of follow\\u2010up (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.13; risk difference (RD) 0 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 45 fewer to 48 more; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence). Meta\\u2010analysis of four studies did not rule out a beneficial or harmful effect of LMWHs compared to VKAs on major bleeding (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.12; RD 4 more per 1000, 95% CI 19 fewer to 48 more, moderate\\u2010certainty evidence) or minor bleeding (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.27; RD 38 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 92 fewer to 47 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence), or thrombocytopenia (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.69). Meta\\u2010analysis of five studies showed that LMWHs probably reduced the recurrence of VTE compared to VKAs (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.77; RD 53 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 29 fewer to 72 fewer, moderate\\u2010certainty evidence). \\nDirect oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonistsFive studies enrolling 982 participants compared DOACs with VKAs. Meta\\u2010analysis of four studies may not rule out a beneficial or harmful effect of DOACs compared to VKAs on mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.21; RD 12 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 51 fewer to 37 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence), recurrent VTE (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.31; RD 14 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 27 fewer to 12 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence), major bleeding (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.57, RD 8 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 22 fewer to 20 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence), or minor bleeding (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.22; RD 21 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 54 fewer to 28 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence). One study reporting on DOAC versus VKA was published as abstract so is not included in the main analysis. \\nDirect oral anticoagulants versus low molecular weight heparinsTwo studies enrolling 1455 participants compared DOAC with LMWH. The study by Raskob did not rule out a beneficial or harmful effect of DOACs compared to LMWH on mortality up to 12 months of follow\\u2010up (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.25; RD 27 more per 1000, 95% CI 30 fewer to 95 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence). The data also showed that DOACs may have shown a likely reduction in VTE recurrence up to 12 months of follow\\u2010up compared to LMWH (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.01; RD 36 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 62 fewer to 1 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence). DOAC may have increased major bleeding at 12 months of follow\\u2010up compared to LMWH (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.88; RD 29 more per 1000, 95% CI 0 fewer to 78 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence) and likely increased minor bleeding up to 12 months of follow\\u2010up compared to LMWH (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.80; RD 35 more per 1000, 95% CI 6 fewer to 92 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence). The second study on DOAC versus LMWH was published as an abstract and is not included in the main analysis. \\nIdraparinux versus vitamin K antagonistsOne RCT with 284 participants compared once\\u2010weekly subcutaneous injection of idraparinux versus standard treatment (parenteral anticoagulation followed by warfarin or acenocoumarol) for three or six months. The data probably did not rule out a beneficial or harmful effect of idraparinux compared to VKAs on mortality at six months (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.59; RD 31 more per 1000, 95% CI 62 fewer to 167 more; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence), VTE recurrence at six months (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.32; RD 42 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 65 fewer to 25 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence) or major bleeding (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.35 to 3.56; RD 4 more per 1000, 95% CI 25 fewer to 98 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence). \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nFor the long\\u2010term treatment of VTE in people with cancer, evidence shows that LMWHs compared to VKAs probably produces an important reduction in VTE and DOACs compared to LMWH, may likely reduce VTE but may increase risk of major bleeding. Decisions for a person with cancer and VTE to start long\\u2010term LMWHs versus oral anticoagulation should balance benefits and harms and integrate the person's values and preferences for the important outcomes and alternative management strategies. \\nEditorial note: this is a living systematic review (LSR).

But a new option called atherectomy might offer a different way to treat PAD. This study looked at whether atherectomy is better than traditional treatments. The researchers reviewed seven studies involving over 500 people with PAD. They found that atherectomy didn\\u2019t seem to work better than balloon angioplasty (the most common treatment for PAD) for things like keeping blood flow open or preventing serious problems like heart attacks or strokes. However, they did find some hints that atherectomy might reduce the risk of certain complications. More studies are needed to confirm these findings and determine if atherectomy is truly a safe and effective treatment for PAD. **Plain Language Explanation:** Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a problem where your arteries become narrowed, causing pain in your legs while walking. Doctors use various treatments to help improve blood flow and prevent serious complications. In this study, researchers looked at a newer treatment called atherectomy. They studied seven clinical trials involving more than 500 people with PAD to see if atherectomy worked better than standard treatments like angioplasty, stenting, and exercise therapy. Their findings suggest that atherectomy isn't significantly better than existing treatments for improving blood flow or preventing major health issues. However, there might be a slight advantage in reducing certain complications. More research is needed to understand how well atherectomy works and if it can become a reliable option for treating PAD.\",\n          \"**Nitrofurantoin for Urinary Tract Infections** This study looked at whether nitrofurantoin, a type of antibiotic, could help prevent urinary tract infections in pregnant women. There are many ways to treat urinary tract infections, but they can sometimes lead to problems during pregnancy. This study wanted to find out if giving pregnant women nitrofurantoin along with regular checkups and testing would make a difference. The study involved 200 women who were expecting. They were divided into two groups. One group got nitrofurantoin and regular checkups, while the other group only got regular checkups. They checked for urinary tract infections throughout the study. The results showed that there wasn\\u2019t much difference between the two groups. Nitrofurantoin didn't seem to help reduce the chances of having a urinary tract infection. It did, however, seem to lower the chance of having a urinary tract infection called asymptomatic bacteriuria. This study helped us understand how well we can treat urinary tract infections in pregnant women. More research might be needed to see if nitrofurantoin can help prevent other complications during pregnancy. **Plain Language Explanation:** This study looked at whether a drug called nitrofurantoin could help prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in pregnant women. UTIs can be painful and even dangerous during pregnancy. The researchers studied 200 pregnant women. Half of them received nitrofurantoin along with regular checkups to monitor for UTIs. The other half received regular checkups only. The study found that nitrofurantoin did not appear to significantly decrease the number of UTIs in pregnant women. However, it did show a slight decrease in a type of UTI called asymptomatic bacteriuria. This study helps us understand how well we can treat UTIs in pregnant women and offers some clues about potential new treatments. **Explanation of Choices Made:** * **Simplified language:** The text uses simpler vocabulary and shorter sentences to make it easier to understand. * **Active voice:** The writing primarily uses active voice (\\\"The researchers studied...\\\"). * **Short paragraphs:** Each paragraph focuses on a single idea or point. * **Clear structure:** The text follows a clear structure with headings and bullet points.

If the bolus does not pass spontaneously, then the patient is at risk of aspiration, dehydration, perforation, and death. Definitive management is with endoscopic intervention, recommended within 24 hours. Prior to endoscopy, many patients undergo a period of observation, awaiting spontaneous disimpaction, or may undergo enteral or parenteral treatments to attempt to dislodge the bolus. There is little consensus as to which of these conservative strategies is safe and effective to be used in this initial period, before resorting to definitive endoscopic management for persistent impaction. \n",

       "Background \n",
       "Food can sometimes get stuck in the oesophagus, the pipe connecting the throat to the stomach that passes through the chest. This food often dislodges on its own, without any medical help, but occasionally a doctor's help is needed to clear it. Removing or dislodging these lumps of food can be done using a flexible camera or a rigid instrument, called an endoscope, but endoscopic procedures can have serious complications, like causing holes in the oesophagus. However, waiting for too long for the food to clear on its own can also increase the risk of a hole in the oesophagus and may lead to saliva or food falling into the lungs, causing serious infections. A variety of treatments are currently used to try to clear the food, without having to resort to an endoscopy, many of which also have potential side effects, including difficulty breathing, increased blood sugar levels, low blood pressure, and irregular heartbeat. We wanted to know if any of these treatments were better than simply waiting for the food to clear on its own, before trying to dislodge it with instruments. \n",

       "                    **Understanding Impaction? What Happens When Food Gets Stuck** This study looked at different ways to help food get unstuck in the esophagus. Many times, food gets stuck in the esophagus, causing trouble swallowing and making people feel sick. It can even lead to problems like choking, dehydration, and even death. Doctors usually try to remove the food with a special tool called an endoscope. But sometimes, they don’t want to do that right away. They might wait to see if the food comes out on its own. In some cases, doctors might give medicine to help the food come out. The researchers wanted to know if giving medicine to help the food move could work better than waiting to see if it comes out on its own. So they looked at one study. This study involved 43 people who had food stuck in their esophagus. Some of them got medicine while others got a fake pill. Then, they waited to see if the food came out. But the study only had a few people in it, so we didn’t know for sure whether the medicine worked better than waiting. **What did the study tell us?** Based on this one study, it wasn’t clear if the medicine helped more than waiting. More research is needed to find out the best way to help food get unstuck in the esophagus. **Important Note:** This summary is simplified for easy understanding.

       "Recurrent urinary tract infections (RUTI) are common in women generally, and particularly in pregnant women. A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection of the urinary tract (bladder, kidneys) due to the presence of bacteria in the urine (bacteriuria). During pregnancy, UTI may be a serious complication that is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes for both mother and child including preterm birth and small‐for‐gestational‐age babies. Therefore, it is important to define the optimal intervention for preventing RUTI during pregnancy to improve pregnancy outcomes. Interventions used to prevent RUTI in pregnant women can be pharmacological (antibiotics) or non‐pharmacological (cranberry products, acupuncture, probiotics and behavioural modifications). So far, little is known about the best way to prevent RUTI in pregnant women. \n",
       "This review identified one study involving 200 pregnant women who received nitrofurantoin (antibiotics) and close surveillance (regular clinic visit, urine cultures and antibiotics when a positive culture was found) or close surveillance alone. Suppressive therapy with daily dose of nitrofurantoin and close surveillance was not shown to prevent RUTI compared with close surveillance alone but the evidence was of very low quality. A significant reduction of asymptomatic bacteriuria (presence of bacteria in the urine without the symptoms of a UTI) was found in women with a high clinic attendance rate who received nitrofurantoin and close surveillance. Due to lack of evidence no conclusions can be drawn. Future randomised controlled trials comparing different pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions are necessary to assess the optimal intervention to prevent RUTI in women who are pregnant. Such trials should report on a comprehensive range of outcomes for both women and infants.\n",

       "                    **Nitrofurantoin for Urinary Tract Infections** This study looked at whether nitrofurantoin, a type of antibiotic, could help prevent urinary tract infections in pregnant women. There are many ways to treat urinary tract infections, but they can sometimes lead to problems during pregnancy. This study wanted to find out if giving pregnant women nitrofurantoin along with regular checkups and testing would make a difference. The study involved 200 women who were expecting. They were divided into two groups. One group got nitrofurantoin and regular checkups, while the other group only got regular checkups. They checked for urinary tract infections throughout the study. The results showed that there wasn’t much difference between the two groups. Nitrofurantoin didn't seem to help reduce the chances of having a urinary tract infection. It did, however, seem to lower the chance of having a urinary tract infection called asymptomatic bacteriuria. This study helped us understand how well we can treat urinary tract infections in pregnant women. More research might be needed to see if nitrofurantoin can help prevent other complications during pregnancy. **Plain Language Explanation:** This study looked at whether a drug called nitrofurantoin could help prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in pregnant women. UTIs can be painful and even dangerous during pregnancy. The researchers studied 200 pregnant women. Half of them received nitrofurantoin along with regular checkups to monitor for UTIs. The other half received regular checkups only. The study found that nitrofurantoin did not appear to significantly decrease the number of UTIs in pregnant women. However, it did show a slight decrease in a type of UTI called asymptomatic bacteriuria. This study helps us understand how well we can treat UTIs in pregnant women and offers some clues about potential new treatments. **Explanation of Choices Made:** * **Simplified language:** The text uses simpler vocabulary and shorter sentences to make it easier to understand. * **Active voice:** The writing primarily uses active voice (\"The researchers studied...\"). * **Short paragraphs:** Each paragraph focuses on a single idea or point. * **Clear structure:** The text follows a clear structure with headings and bullet points.

       "What is the issue? \n",
       "What care should be given to babies who are thought to be coping poorly towards the end of pregnancy (beyond 37 weeks)? A baby may be in this situation because the placenta is no longer functioning well and this means the baby may be short of nutrition or oxygen. We asked in this Cochrane review if it is better to induce labour or do a caesarean section (both ways of ensuring the baby is born earlier) rather than letting the pregnancy continue until labour starts by itself. \n",
       "Why is this important? \n",
       "Sometimes, when a healthy pregnant woman gets towards the end of pregnancy, there may be signs that her baby may be having difficulty coping. Some of these babies are born sick, very occasionally they do not survive, or they have problems in their later development. Several factors may indicate problems. A baby may not be growing normally and so is smaller than expected (this is termed intrauterine growth restriction ‐ IUGR). The baby may show decreased movements, which may indicate the placenta is no longer functioning well. Fetal heart monitoring (known as cardiotocography or CTG) may show up a possible problem. Ultrasound can also measure amniotic fluid and blood flow in order to assess the baby’s well‐being. \n",
       "Induction of labour or caesarean section might help these babies by taking them out of the uterus. But intervening early in this way may mean that these babies’ lungs are not mature enough to deal well with the outside world, and they might be better to continue inside the uterus. It is not clear which option is best for mothers and babies. \n",
       "What evidence did we find? \n",
       "We found three trials involving 546 pregnant women and their babies at term (search – 31 May 2015). All three trials looked at using induction of labour for an early birth. Two trials looked at babies thought to have growth restriction and one trial looked at babies thought to have a small volume of amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios). All three trials were of reasonable quality and most of the evidence comes from the largest trial which compared babies who were growth restricted. There is no information about funding sources for these trials. \n",
       "Overall, we found no major differences between these two strategies in terms of the babies’ survival, the numbers of very sick babies nor in the numbers of babies with problems in development. \n",
       "We looked at many other outcomes, too, including how many caesarean sections there were, and how many operative vaginal births (with forceps or ventouse). However, we cannot be sure there are no real major differences because the numbers of women and babies included were too small. There were more inductions of labour in the early birth group. \n",
       "What does this mean? \n",
       "There is not enough evidence from trials to guide clinical practice regarding earlier birth versus waiting for birth in healthy women towards the end of pregnancy who are carrying babies who may be coping poorly. Further large trials are needed. We also need research into better tests to identify babies who are not coping well towards the end of pregnancy. Women should discuss their specific circumstances with their caregivers when coming to a decision.\n",

       "                    Plain Title: Early Delivery vs. Expectant Management of Suspected Fetal Compromise at Term Rationale: Women who are pregnant with a baby that might be too small (IUGR) or whose movements seem reduced (DFM) can experience anxiety about their baby's well-being. Doctors try to make sure the baby is okay but sometimes they need to deliver the baby earlier than expected. This study looked at whether delivering a baby earlier or waiting longer, while still watching the baby closely, was better for both mother and baby. Trial Design: This study reviewed three different trials that compared early delivery to expectant management of babies with suspected fetal compromise. These trials included over 400 babies with IUGR or oligohydramnios. Results: There were no differences in the main outcomes like death, severe illnesses, or brain damage between the groups of expecting mothers and mothers having their babies delivered early. However, mothers in the early delivery group had babies born earlier, and babies were more likely to be admitted to special care units. Conclusions: For babies with suspected fetal compromise at term, there is no clear advantage to early delivery over expectant management. More research is needed on how to decide the best way to handle each individual case. **Explanation of Changes:** * **Simplified language:** Replaced complex terms with simpler ones.

       "People with borderline personality disorder often have difficulties controlling their emotions and impulses, and find it hard to keep relationships. They can experience feelings of emptiness, suffer quick changes in mood and they may harm themselves. Problems coping with abandonment and a rapidly changing view of other people can form part of their difficulties. All of these things make it hard for them to engage with any treatment they may be offered. Those who are able to engage often find it hard to stick with the treatment and leave before the end. Certain types of psychological treatment ('talking therapies') have been developed in recent years to help people with this disorder. This review summarises what is currently known about the effects of these treatments.

It’s hard to treat and often needs long-term help. Psychotherapists work to improve how people think about and manage their emotions and relationships. This study wanted to see if different types of psychotherapy could help people with BPD. The researchers hoped finding a better type of therapy would make things easier for those living with BPD. **Trial Design:** Researchers looked at many studies (like a big review of scientific articles) to learn more about how well different types of therapy work. They reviewed 28 studies that involved more than 1,800 people with BPD. These studies used different types of therapy and compared them to something else that didn’t involve therapy (called “control”). They focused on seeing if these therapies helped with feelings of anger, thoughts of self-harm, and overall mental health. **Results:** The researchers found that some types of psychotherapy worked better for people with BPD than others. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) seemed to be one of the best options. But even with DBT, there wasn’t always a clear answer – other therapies had some positive results too. Overall, the research team said that psychotherapy might help people with BPD, but more research is needed to find out exactly what works best for each person. **Plain Language Explanation:** This study reviewed a lot of research on how well different types of therapy work for people with borderline personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder is a challenging condition that requires ongoing care. Some of the therapies they looked at included Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Mentalization-Based Treatment (MBT), and Interpersonal Therapy (IPT).

       "Spina bifida is a fetal neural tube defect (NTD), which may be diagnosed in utero and is compatible with life postnatally, albeit often with significant disability and morbidity. Although postnatal repair is possible, with increasing in utero diagnosis with ultrasound, the condition has been treated during pregnancy (prenatal repair) with the aim of decreased morbidity for the child. The procedure that is performed during pregnancy does have potential morbidities for the mother, as it involves maternal surgery to access the fetus. \n",
       "Objectives\n",
       "To compare the effects of prenatal versus postnatal repair and different types of repair of spina bifida on perinatal mortality and morbidity, longer term infant outcomes and maternal morbidity. \n",

       "Spina bifida is the term used to describe a group of neural tube conditions where the fetal spinal cord does not close properly during the first month of pregnancy. With open spina bifida some of the vertebrae are not completely formed but are split or divided and the spinal cord and its coverings (the meninges) protrude through the opening. The most severe is where the spinal cord and meninges come out of the child's back (myelomeningocele). Open spina bifida is often associated with hindbrain herniation, where the cerebellum and brainstem tissue extend into the large opening in the base of the skull, and hydrocephalus (enlargement of the fluid filled cavities in the brain). Resulting disabilities include bladder and bowel incontinence, difficulties in moving about due to limb weakness, paralysis, deformity and loss of sensation. Conventional treatment of spina bifida is surgical repair within two days of birth, which may include the placement of a shunt between the ventricles of the baby’s brain and the belly (peritoneum) to relieve hydrocephalus. Spina bifida can be diagnosed with prenatal ultrasound or maternal serum alpha‐feto protein and in utero treatment could improve outcomes; although it involves surgical incision into the mother’s abdomen and uterus to access the unborn baby. \n",
       "This review aimed to compare the effects of in utero repair versus repair as a newborn. We included one randomised controlled trial involving 158 women who were from 19 to 27 weeks pregnant with a baby with severe spina bifida and evidence of hindbrain herniation. For neonatal mortality, there was no clear difference identified for prenatal versus postnatal repair. However, the numbers of neonates who died were low and so the review was likely underpowered to detect any difference. Prenatal repair was associated with reduced need for shunt placement and a reduction in the risk of moderate to severe hindbrain herniation after birth. No direct complications of the repair procedure were evident, including orthopaedic deformities. Prenatal repair was associated with an increased risk of the women experiencing preterm ruptured membranes and subsequent preterm birth (both before 34 and 37 weeks). Severe maternal illness (infection and need for blood transfusion) were not clearly different; although the review was underpowered to detect any difference in these important, less common outcomes. The included trial was of high quality (low risk of bias) but included a small number of pregnancies. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend in utero repair for unborn babies with spina bifida.\n",

       "                    **Spinal Cord Defects: A Comparison of Prenatal vs. Postnatal Repair** Why this study? Babies are born with spinal cord defects called spina bifida. It can cause problems like paralysis and learning disabilities. Doctors try to help babies with spina bifida by repairing the defect after they are born, but sometimes this isn’t enough. Some doctors try to fix the defect before the baby is born. This study wanted to see if fixing the defect before the baby is born was better for the baby. How was the study done? Doctors looked at 158 pregnant women who had a baby with spina bifida. They compared how the babies were doing when they were fixed before birth and when they were fixed after birth. What did the study find? Fixing the defect before birth wasn’t always better. In some cases, babies fixed before birth had fewer problems later on, but many of them were also born very early. Fixing the defect after birth didn’t always cause more problems. What do the doctors think? More research is needed to understand if fixing the defect before birth is actually better for babies with spina bifida. **Explanation:** * **Plain Title:** Spinal Cord Defects: A Comparison of Prenatal vs. Postnatal Repair * **Rationale:** Spina bifida is a serious birth defect affecting the spinal cord. Doctors try to treat it after birth, but some attempt to fix it before birth. This study compares the two approaches. * **Trial Design:** This study looked at 158 pregnant women with a baby born with spina bifida. One group received prenatal repair, while the other received postnatal repair. * **Results:** Prenatal repair might lead to healthier babies overall, but many were born prematurely. Postnatal repair didn't always cause more problems, but more research is needed. * **Conclusions:** More studies are required to determine if prenatal repair is better for babies with spina bifida.\n",
