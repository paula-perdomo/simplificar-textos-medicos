Recently vegan diets have gained popularity and there is a need to synthesise existing clinical trial evidence for their potential in CVD prevention. \\nObjectives\\nTo determine the effectiveness of following a vegan dietary pattern for the primary and secondary prevention of CVD. \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched the following electronic databases on 4 February 2020: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),\\u00a0MEDLINE,\\u00a0Embase and\\u00a0Web of Science Core Collection. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov in January 2021. We applied no\\u00a0language restrictions. \\nSelection criteria\\nWe selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in healthy adults and adults at high risk of CVD (primary prevention) and those with established CVD (secondary prevention). A vegan dietary pattern excludes meat, fish, eggs, dairy and honey; the intervention could be dietary advice, provision of relevant foods, or both. The comparison group received either no intervention, minimal intervention, or another dietary intervention. Outcomes included clinical events and CVD risk factors. We included only studies with follow\\u2010up periods of 12 weeks or more, defined as the intervention period plus post\\u2010intervention follow\\u2010up. \\nData collection and analysis\\nTwo review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risks of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We conducted three main comparisons: \\n1. Vegan dietary intervention versus no intervention or minimal intervention for primary prevention;2. Vegan dietary intervention versus another dietary intervention for primary prevention;3. Vegan dietary intervention versus another dietary intervention for secondary prevention. \\nMain results\\nThirteen RCTs (38 papers, 7 trial registrations) and eight ongoing trials met our inclusion criteria. Most trials contributed to primary prevention: comparisons 1 (four trials, 466 participants randomised) and comparison 2 (eight trials, 409 participants randomised). We included only one secondary prevention trial for comparison 3 (63 participants randomised). \\nNone of the trials reported on clinical endpoints. Other primary outcomes included lipid levels and blood pressure. \\nFor comparison 1 there was moderate\\u2010certainty evidence from four trials with 449 participants that a vegan diet probably led to a small reduction in total cholesterol (mean difference (MD) \\u22120.24 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) \\u22120.36 to \\u22120.12) and low\\u2010density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (MD \\u22120.22 mmol/L, 95% CI \\u22120.32 to \\u22120.11), a very small decrease in high\\u2010density lipoprotein (HDL) levels (MD \\u22120.08 mmol/L, 95% CI \\u22120.11 to \\u22120.04) and a very small increase in triglyceride levels (MD 0.11 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.21). The very small changes in HDL and triglyceride levels are in the opposite direction to that expected. There was a lack of evidence for an effect with the vegan dietary intervention on systolic blood pressure (MD 0.94 mmHg, 95% CI \\u22121.18 to 3.06; 3 trials, 374 participants) and\\u00a0diastolic blood pressure (MD \\u22120.27 mmHg, 95% CI \\u22121.67 to 1.12;\\u00a03 trials, 372\\u00a0participants) (low\\u2010certainty evidence). \\nFor comparison 2 there was a lack of evidence for an effect of the vegan dietary intervention on total cholesterol levels (MD \\u22120.04 mmol/L, 95% CI \\u22120.28 to 0.20;\\u00a04 trials, 163 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence). There was probably little or no effect of the vegan dietary intervention on LDL (MD \\u22120.05 mmol/L, 95% CI \\u22120.21 to 0.11; 4 trials,\\u00a0244 participants) or HDL cholesterol levels (MD \\u22120.01 mmol/L, 95% CI \\u22120.08 to 0.05; 5 trials, 256 participants) or triglycerides (MD 0.21 mmol/L, 95% CI \\u22120.07 to 0.49; 5 trials, 256 participants) compared to other dietary interventions (moderate\\u2010certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about any effect of the vegan dietary intervention on systolic blood pressure\\u00a0(MD 0.02 mmHg, 95% CI \\u22123.59 to 3.62)\\u00a0 or diastolic blood pressure\\u00a0(MD 0.63 mmHg, 95% CI \\u22121.54 to 2.80; 5 trials, 247 participants (very low\\u2010certainty evidence)). \\nOnly one trial (63 participants) contributed to comparison 3, where there was a lack of evidence for an effect of the vegan dietary intervention on lipid levels or blood pressure compared to other dietary interventions (low\\u2010 or very low\\u2010certainty evidence). \\nFour trials reported on adverse events, which were absent or minor.\\nAuthors' conclusions\\nStudies were generally small with few participants contributing to each comparison group. None of the included studies report on CVD clinical events. There is currently insufficient information to draw conclusions about the effects of vegan dietary interventions on CVD risk factors. The eight ongoing studies identified will add to the evidence base, with all eight reporting on primary prevention. There is a paucity of evidence for secondary prevention. \\n\",\n          \"Background\\nIvermectin, an antiparasitic agent, inhibits the replication of viruses in vitro. The molecular hypothesis of ivermectin's antiviral mode of action suggests an inhibitory effect on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\u2010CoV\\u20102) replication in early stages of infection.\\u00a0Currently, evidence on ivermectin for prevention of SARS\\u2010CoV\\u20102 infection and COVID\\u201019 treatment is conflicting. \\nObjectives\\nTo assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo, or any other proven intervention for people with COVID\\u201019 receiving treatment as inpatients or outpatients, and for prevention of an infection with SARS\\u2010CoV\\u20102 (postexposure prophylaxis). \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched the Cochrane COVID\\u201019 Study Register, Web of Science (Emerging Citation Index and Science Citation Index), WHO COVID\\u201019 Global literature on coronavirus disease, and HTA database weekly to identify completed and ongoing trials without language restrictions to 16 December 2021. Additionally, we included trials with > 1000 participants up to April 2022. \\nSelection criteria\\nWe included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ivermectin to standard of care, placebo, or another proven intervention for treatment of people with confirmed COVID\\u201019 diagnosis, irrespective of disease severity or treatment setting, and for prevention of SARS\\u2010CoV\\u20102 infection. Co\\u2010interventions had to be the same in both study arms.\\u00a0 \\nFor this review update, we reappraised eligible trials for research integrity: only RCTs prospectively registered in a trial registry according to WHO guidelines for clinical trial registration were eligible for inclusion. \\nData collection and analysis\\nWe assessed RCTs for bias, using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We used GRADE to rate the certainty of evidence for outcomes in the following settings and populations: 1) to treat inpatients with moderate\\u2010to\\u2010severe COVID\\u201019, 2) to treat outpatients with mild COVID\\u201019 (outcomes: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, (serious) adverse events,\\u00a0quality of life, and viral clearance), and 3) to prevent SARS\\u2010CoV\\u20102 infection (outcomes: SARS\\u2010CoV\\u20102 infection, development of COVID\\u201019 symptoms, admission to hospital, mortality, adverse events and quality of life). \\nMain results\\nWe excluded seven of the 14 trials included in the previous review version; six were not prospectively registered and one was non\\u2010randomized. This updated review includes 11 trials with 3409 participants investigating ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo. No trial investigated ivermectin for prevention of infection or compared ivermectin to an intervention with proven efficacy. Five trials treated participants with moderate COVID\\u201019 (inpatient settings); six treated mild COVID\\u201019 (outpatient settings). Eight trials were double\\u2010blind and placebo\\u2010controlled, and three were open\\u2010label.\\u00a0We assessed around 50% of the trial results as low risk of bias. \\nWe identified 31 ongoing trials. In addition, there are 28 potentially eligible trials without publication of results, or with disparities in the reporting of the methods and results, held in \\u2018awaiting classification\\u2019 until the trial authors clarify questions upon request. \\nIvermectin for\\u00a0treating\\u00a0COVID\\u201019 in inpatient settings with moderate\\u2010to\\u2010severe disease \\nWe are uncertain whether ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo reduces or increases all\\u2010cause mortality at 28 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 2.51; 3 trials, 230 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence); or clinical worsening, assessed by participants with new need for invasive mechanical ventilation or death at day 28 (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.04; 2 trials, 118 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence); or serious adverse events during the trial period (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.07 to 35.89; 2 trials, 197 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). Ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus placebo may have little or no effect on clinical improvement, assessed by the number of participants discharged alive at day 28 (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.35; 1 trial, 73 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence); on any adverse events during the trial period (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.79; 3 trials, 228 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence); and on viral clearance at 7 days (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.58; 3 trials, 231 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence). No trial investigated quality of life at any time point. \\nIvermectin for\\u00a0treating\\u00a0COVID\\u201019 in outpatient settings with asymptomatic or mild disease \\nIvermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo probably has little or no effect on all\\u2010cause mortality at day 28 (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.25; 6 trials, 2860 participants; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence) and little or no effect on quality of life, measured with the PROMIS Global\\u201010 scale (physical component mean difference (MD) 0.00, 95% CI \\u20100.98 to 0.98; and mental component MD 0.00, 95% CI \\u20101.08 to 1.08; 1358 participants; high\\u2010certainty evidence). Ivermectin may have little or no effect on clinical worsening, assessed by admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.20 to 6.02; 2 trials, 590 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence); on clinical improvement, assessed by the number of participants with all initial symptoms resolved up to 14 days (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.36; 2 trials, 478 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence); on serious adverse events (RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.62 to 8.31; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence); on any adverse events during the trial period (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.76; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence); and on viral clearance at day 7 compared to placebo (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.48; 2 trials, 331 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence). None of the trials reporting duration of symptoms were eligible for meta\\u2010analysis. \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nFor outpatients, there is currently low\\u2010 to high\\u2010certainty evidence that ivermectin has no beneficial effect for people with COVID\\u201019. Based on the very low\\u2010certainty evidence for inpatients, we are still uncertain whether ivermectin prevents death or clinical worsening or increases serious adverse events, while there is low\\u2010certainty evidence that it has no beneficial effect regarding clinical improvement, viral clearance and adverse events. No evidence is available on ivermectin to prevent SARS\\u2010CoV\\u20102 infection. In this update, certainty of evidence increased through higher quality trials including more participants. According to this review's living approach, we will continually update our search. \\n\",\n          \"Background\\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological cause of disability in young adults.

We used the Cochrane Collaboration\\u2019s tool for assessing risk of bias. We rated the certainty of evidence using GRADE for:\\u00a0disability worsening, relapse, serious adverse events (SAEs), health\\u2010related quality of life (HRQoL), common infections, cancer, and mortality. We conducted\\u00a0separate analyses\\u00a0for rituximab as 'first choice' or as 'switching', relapsing or progressive MS, comparison versus placebo or another DMT, and RCTs or NRSIs. \\nMain results\\nWe included 15 studies (5 RCTs, 10 NRSIs) with 16,429 participants of whom 13,143 were relapsing MS and 3286 progressive MS. The studies were\\u00a0one to two years long and compared rituximab as 'first choice' with placebo (1 RCT) or other DMTs (1 NRSI), rituximab as 'switching' against placebo (2 RCTs) or other DMTs (2 RCTs, 9 NRSIs). The studies were conducted worldwide; most originated from high\\u2010income countries, six from the Swedish MS register. Pharmaceutical companies funded two studies. We identified 14 ongoing studies. \\nRituximab as 'first choice' for relapsing MS \\nRituximab versus placebo: no studies met eligibility criteria for this comparison.\\nRituximab versus other DMTs: one NRSI compared rituximab with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate, dimethyl fumarate, natalizumab, or fingolimod in active relapsing MS at 24 months' follow\\u2010up.

The included studies did not measure SAEs, HRQoL, and cancer. \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nFor preventing relapses in relapsing MS, rituximab as 'first choice' and as 'switching' may compare favourably with a wide range of approved DMTs. A protective effect of rituximab against disability worsening is uncertain. There is limited information to determine the effect of rituximab for progressive MS.\\u00a0 \\nThe evidence is uncertain about the effect of rituximab on SAEs. They are relatively rare in people with MS, thus difficult to study, and they were not well reported in studies. There is an increased risk of common infections with rituximab, but absolute risk is small.\\u00a0 \\nRituximab is widely used as off\\u2010label treatment in people with MS; however, randomised evidence is weak. In the absence of randomised evidence, remaining uncertainties on beneficial and adverse effects of rituximab for MS might be clarified by making real\\u2010world data available. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Professional bodies recommend the use of clinical assessment protocols or evaluation tools, commonly referred to as physiological track\\u2010and\\u2010trigger systems (TTS) or early warning systems (EWS), as a means of helping maternity care providers recognise actual or potential clinical deterioration early. TTS/EWS are clinician\\u2010administered (midwife, obstetrician), bedside physiological assessment protocols, charts or tools designed to record routinely assessed clinical parameters; that is, blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, urine output and mental/neurological alertness. In general, these systems involve the application of scores or alert indicators to the observed physiological parameters based on their prespecified limits of normality. The overall system score or alert limit is then used to assist the maternity care provider identify a need to escalate care. This, in turn, may allow for earlier intervention(s) to alter the course of the emerging critical illness and ultimately reduce or avoid mortality and morbidity sequelae. \\nObjectives\\nTo evaluate the clinical\\u2010 and cost\\u2010effectiveness of maternal physiological TTS/EWS on pregnancy, labour and birth, postpartum (up to 42 days) and neonatal outcomes. \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (28 May 2021), ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (7 June 2021), OpenGrey, the ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database (7 June 2021), and reference lists of retrieved studies. \\nSelection criteria\\nWe included randomised and quasi\\u2010randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster\\u2010RCTs, comparing physiological TTS/EWS with no system or another system. Participants were women who were pregnant or had given birth within the previous 42 days, at high risk and low risk for pregnancy, labour and birth, and postpartum complications. \\nData collection and analysis\\nTwo review authors (VS and MN) independently assessed all identified papers for inclusion and performed risk of bias assessments. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion and consensus. Data extraction was also conducted independently by two review authors (VS and MN) and checked for accuracy. We used the summary odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to present the results for dichotomous data and the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI to present the results for continuous data. \\nMain results\\nWe included two studies, a parallel RCT involving 700 women and a stepped\\u2010wedge cluster trial involving 536,233 women. Both studies were published in 2019, and both were conducted in low\\u2010resource settings. The interventions were the 'Saving Mothers Score' (SMS) and the CRADLE Vital Sign Alert (VSA) device, and both interventions were compared with standard care. Both studies had low or unclear risk of bias on all seven risk of bias criteria. Evidence certainty, assessed using GRADE, ranged from very low to moderate certainty, mainly due to other bias as well as inconsistency and imprecision. \\nFor women randomised to TTS/EWS compared to standard care there is probably little to no difference in maternal death (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.11; 1 study, 536,233 participants; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence). Use of TTS/EWS compared to standard care may reduce total haemorrhage (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.69; 1 study, 700 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence). For women randomised to TTS/EWS compared to standard care there may be little to no difference in\\u00a0sepsis (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.80; 1 study, 700 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence), eclampsia (OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.74 to 3.03; 2 studies, 536,933 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence) and HELLP (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.40; 1 study, 700 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence), and probably little to no difference in maternal admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) (OR 0.78, 95% CI \\u00a00.53 to 1.15; 2 studies, 536,933 participants; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence). Use of TTS/EWS compared to standard care may reduce a woman's length of hospital stay (MD \\u20101.21, 95% CI \\u20101.78 to \\u20100.64; 1 study, 700 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence) but may result in little to no difference in neonatal death (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.84; 1 study, 700 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence). Cost\\u2010effectiveness measures were not measured in either of the two studies.\\u00a0 \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nUse of TTS/EWS in maternity care may be helpful in reducing some maternal outcomes such as haemorrhage and maternal length of hospital stay, possibly through early identification of clinical deterioration and escalation of care. The evidence suggests that the use of TTS/EWS compared to standard care probably results in little to no difference in maternal death and may result in little to no difference in neonatal death. Both of the included studies were conducted in low\\u2010resource settings where the use of TTS/EWS might potentially confer a different effect to TTS/EWS use in high\\u2010resource settings. Further high\\u2010quality trials in high\\u2010 and middle\\u2010resource settings, as well as in discrete populations of high\\u2010 and low\\u2010risk women, are required. \\n\",\n          \"Methotrexate for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease\\nAlthough corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission of Crohn's disease, many patients relapse when steroids are withdrawn or become steroid dependent. Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant side effects. Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug that is used to treat active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. This review includes seven randomized trials with a total of 495 participants. There is evidence from one large study which suggests that methotrexate (25 mg/week) injected intramuscularly for 16 weeks among patients with active treatment resistant Crohn's disease may provide a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids. This reduction in steroid use could reduce steroid\\u2010induced side effects for people with chronic Crohn's disease. Although side effects are more common with high dose methotrexate therapy, no serious side effects have been observed. Common side effects associated with methotrexate therapy include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash and headache. Studies comparing lower dose oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) to placebo (e.g. sugar pill) or other active drugs (e.g. azathioprine or 6\\u2010mercaptopurine) indicate that lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any benefit for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. However, these trials were small in size and further studies of oral methotrexate may be justified. Two studies looked at the combination of methotrexate and infliximab (a biological drug) compared to infliximab therapy alone. These studies indicated that the addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infiximab. However these studies were relatively small and further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies. \\n\",\n          \"Background\\nWith the emergence of SARS\\u2010CoV\\u20102 in late 2019, governments worldwide implemented a multitude of non\\u2010pharmaceutical interventions in order to control the spread of the virus. Most countries have implemented measures within the school setting in order to reopen schools or keep them open whilst aiming to contain the spread of SARS\\u2010CoV\\u20102. For informed decision\\u2010making on implementation, adaptation, or suspension of such measures, it is not only crucial to evaluate their effectiveness with regard to SARS\\u2010CoV\\u20102 transmission, but also to assess their unintended consequences. \\nObjectives\\nTo comprehensively identify and map the evidence on the unintended health and societal consequences of school\\u2010based measures to prevent and control the spread of SARS\\u2010CoV\\u20102. We aimed to generate a descriptive overview of the range of unintended (beneficial or harmful) consequences reported as well as the study designs that were employed to assess these outcomes. This review was designed to complement an existing Cochrane Review on the effectiveness of these measures by synthesising evidence on the implications of the broader system\\u2010level implications of school measures beyond their effects on SARS\\u2010CoV\\u20102 transmission. \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, four non\\u2010health databases, and two COVID\\u201019 reference collections on 26 March 2021, together with reference checking, citation searching, and Google searches. \\nSelection criteria\\nWe included quantitative (including mathematical modelling), qualitative, and mixed\\u2010methods studies of any design that provided evidence on any unintended consequences of measures implemented in the school setting to contain the SARS\\u2010CoV\\u20102 pandemic. Studies had to report on at least one unintended consequence, whether beneficial or harmful, of one or more relevant measures, as conceptualised in a logic model.\\u00a0 \\nData collection and analysis\\nWe screened the titles/abstracts and subsequently full texts in duplicate, with any discrepancies between review authors resolved through discussion. One review author extracted data for all included studies, with a second review author reviewing the data extraction for accuracy. The evidence was summarised narratively and graphically across four prespecified intervention categories and six prespecified categories of unintended consequences; findings were described as deriving from quantitative, qualitative, or mixed\\u2010method studies. \\nMain results\\nEighteen studies met our inclusion criteria. Of these, 13 used quantitative methods (3 experimental/quasi\\u2010experimental; 5 observational; 5 modelling); four used qualitative methods; and one used mixed methods. Studies looked at effects in different population groups, mainly in children and teachers. The identified interventions were assigned to four broad categories: 14 studies assessed measures to make contacts safer; four studies looked at measures to reduce contacts; six studies assessed surveillance and response measures; and one study examined multiple measures combined. Studies addressed a wide range of unintended consequences, most of them considered harmful. Eleven studies investigated educational consequences. Seven studies reported on psychosocial outcomes.\\u00a0Three studies each provided information on physical health and health behaviour outcomes beyond COVID\\u201019 and environmental consequences. Two studies reported on socio\\u2010economic consequences, and no studies reported on equity and equality consequences. \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nWe identified a heterogeneous evidence base on unintended consequences of measures implemented in the school setting to prevent and control the spread of SARS\\u2010CoV\\u20102, and summarised the available study data narratively and graphically. Primary research better focused on specific measures and various unintended outcomes is needed to fill knowledge gaps and give a broader picture of the diverse unintended consequences of school\\u2010based measures before a more thorough evidence synthesis is warranted. The most notable lack of evidence we found was regarding psychosocial, equity, and equality outcomes. We also found a lack of research on interventions that aim to reduce the opportunity for contacts. Additionally, study investigators should provide sufficient data on contextual factors and demographics in order to ensure analyses of such are feasible, thus assisting stakeholders in making appropriate, informed decisions for their specific circumstances. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"simplified_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"# Plain Language Summary: Using Early Warning Systems to Detect Health Problems in Pregnant Women\\n\\n## Plain Title\\n\\nCan special tracking tools help doctors and nurses spot health problems earlier in pregnant women?\\n\\n## Rationale\\n\\n**What is the problem?**\\n\\nPregnant women can become very sick very quickly. Doctors and nurses sometimes find it hard to notice when a pregnant woman's health is getting worse. Missing early warning signs can lead to serious problems for both mother and baby.\\n\\n**What are early warning systems?**\\n\\nEarly warning systems are special charts or tools that nurses and doctors use at the bedside. They check and write down important body signs like blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, how much urine a woman makes, and how alert she is. The system gives scores or alerts when these signs are not normal. This helps staff know when they need to get more help or start treatment quickly.\\n\\n**Why was this study needed?**\\n\\nHealth experts think these tracking tools might help save lives. By catching problems early, doctors can treat women sooner. This might prevent serious illness or death for mothers and babies. However, researchers needed to find out if these tools really work.\\n\\n## Trial Design\\n\\n**How was this study designed?**\\n\\nResearchers looked for all studies that tested early warning systems in pregnant women. They found two studies that met their standards. One study included 700 women. The other study was much larger with 536,233 women. Both studies were done in 2019 in countries with fewer medical resources.\\n\\n**Who was in the studies?**\\n\\nThe studies included women who were pregnant or had given birth within the past 42 days. The women had different levels of health risk. Some were healthy, while others had higher chances of problems.\\n\\n**What did the studies compare?**\\n\\nBoth studies tested special early warning tools. One tool was called the \\\"Saving Mothers Score.\\\" The other was called the \\\"CRADLE Vital Sign Alert device.\\\" Researchers compared these tools to regular care without special tracking systems.\\n\\n## Results\\n\\n**What did the researchers find?**\\n\\nThe studies showed mixed results:\\n\\n**Deaths:** Using early warning systems probably made little to no difference in how many mothers died. The tools also made little to no difference in how many babies died.\\n\\n**Bleeding:** The early warning systems may help reduce severe bleeding after birth. This was one clear benefit found in the research.\\n\\n**Hospital stays:** Women who were tracked with these systems may have spent less time in the hospital. On average, they left about one day earlier.\\n\\n**Other serious problems:** The tools may make little to no difference in other serious conditions. These include blood infections, seizures from high blood pressure, and liver problems. The tools probably made little to no difference in how many women needed intensive care.\\n\\n**What does this mean?**\\n\\nEarly warning systems might help in some ways. They may reduce bleeding and shorten hospital stays. This could happen because staff notice problems earlier and act faster. However, the tools did not clearly reduce deaths of mothers or babies in these studies.\\n\\n**Important notes:**\\n\\nBoth studies took place in countries with limited medical resources. The tools might work differently in countries with more hospitals and equipment. More research is needed in different settings and with different groups of women.\\n\\n**What comes next?**\\n\\nResearchers need to do more high-quality studies. These should include countries with better medical resources. They should also look at women with different health risks separately. This will help doctors know when these tools work best.\\n\\n**Cost information:**\\n\\nNeither study looked at whether these systems save money. This is important information that future studies should include.\",\n          \"# Plain Language Summary: Methotrexate for Treatment of Active Treatment Resistant Crohn's Disease\\n\\n## Plain Title\\nDoes methotrexate help people with Crohn's disease that is hard to treat?\\n\\n## Rationale\\n\\n**What is Crohn's disease?**\\nCrohn's disease is a long-term health problem. It causes swelling in the gut. This can lead to pain, diarrhea, and feeling very tired. People with Crohn's disease often feel very sick.\\n\\n**Current treatment problems**\\nDoctors often use steroid drugs to treat Crohn's disease. Steroids can help at first. But many patients get sick again when they stop taking steroids. Some patients need to take steroids all the time. This is called steroid dependent. Steroids can cause bad side effects when used for a long time.\\n\\n**Why study methotrexate?**\\nMethotrexate is a drug that calms down the body's defense system. Doctors wanted to know if methotrexate could help patients with Crohn's disease. They wanted to see if it could help patients stop taking steroids. This would reduce the bad side effects from steroids.\\n\\n**Why was this study needed?**\\nResearchers needed to find out if methotrexate really works. They wanted to know the best dose. They also wanted to know if it was safe.\\n\\n## Trial Design\\n\\n**How was this study designed?**\\nResearchers looked at seven different studies. These studies tested methotrexate in different ways. A total of 495 people took part in all the studies combined.\\n\\n**Who was in the studies?**\\nThe studies included adults with Crohn's disease. These patients had disease that was hard to treat. Regular treatments had not worked well for them.\\n\\n**What did the studies test?**\\nSome studies tested methotrexate shots given into the muscle. The dose was 25 mg each week. Other studies tested methotrexate pills taken by mouth. The dose was lower, between 12.5 and 15 mg each week. Some studies compared methotrexate to fake pills with no medicine. Some studies compared methotrexate to other drugs.\\n\\n**How long did the studies last?**\\nThe main study lasted 16 weeks. Different studies had different lengths.\\n\\n## Results\\n\\n**What did the researchers find?**\\n\\n**High dose methotrexate shots work**\\nOne large study showed good results. Patients got methotrexate shots of 25 mg each week. The shots went into the muscle. After 16 weeks, these patients got better. Their disease went into remission. This means their symptoms went away. These patients were also able to stop taking steroids completely.\\n\\n**Benefits for patients**\\nThis is good news for patients. Methotrexate may help control Crohn's disease. It may help patients stop using steroids. This means fewer side effects from steroids. Patients may feel better overall.\\n\\n**Low dose methotrexate pills do not work as well**\\nStudies tested lower doses of methotrexate. These were pills taken by mouth. The dose was 12.5 to 15 mg each week. These lower doses did not seem to help much. They did not work better than fake pills. But these studies were small. More research may be needed.\\n\\n**Methotrexate with other drugs**\\nTwo studies looked at using methotrexate with infliximab. Infliximab is another drug for Crohn's disease. Adding methotrexate to infliximab did not seem to help more. But these studies were small. More research is needed.\\n\\n**Side effects**\\nMethotrexate can cause side effects. Common side effects include feeling sick to your stomach, throwing up, belly pain, loose stools, skin rash, and headache. These side effects happen more with higher doses. But no serious side effects were seen in these studies.\\n\\n**What do these results mean?**\\nHigh dose methotrexate shots may help people with hard-to-treat Crohn's disease. It may help them get better and stop taking steroids. This could improve their quality of life. The drug appears to be safe when used this way. More research is needed on lower doses and combining it with other drugs.\",\n          \"# Plain Language Summary\\n\\n## Plain Title\\nWhat Are the Unintended Effects of School Safety Measures Used During COVID-19?\\n\\n## Rationale\\n\\n### What is the condition?\\nIn late 2019, a new virus called SARS-CoV-2 caused COVID-19. This virus spread quickly around the world. Governments tried many ways to stop the virus from spreading.\\n\\n### Why did researchers do this study?\\nSchools are important places where children learn and grow. During the pandemic, many schools closed or changed how they worked. Governments created new rules to keep schools open safely. These rules included things like wearing masks, keeping distance between students, and testing for the virus.\\n\\nResearchers wanted to know if these school rules had other effects beyond stopping the virus. Some effects might be helpful. Some effects might be harmful. For example, school rules might affect how well children learn. They might affect how children feel. They might change how families spend money.\\n\\n### Why was this study needed?\\nLeaders need to know all the effects of school rules, not just whether they stop the virus. This helps them make better choices about which rules to use. This study looked at what other researchers found about these unintended effects. The goal was to create a map of all the different effects that have been studied.\\n\\n## Trial Design\\n\\n### How was this study designed?\\nThis was not a study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at other studies that had already been done. They searched for studies published up to March 2021.\\n\\nThe researchers looked for studies about school rules during COVID-19. These rules had to be meant to stop the virus from spreading. The studies had to report on unintended effects of these rules.\\n\\nThe researchers grouped the school rules into four types:\\n- Rules to make contact safer (like wearing masks)\\n- Rules to reduce contact (like closing schools)\\n- Rules to watch and respond (like testing students)\\n- Multiple rules used together\\n\\nThey also grouped the unintended effects into six types:\\n- Effects on learning\\n- Effects on mental health and social life\\n- Effects on physical health\\n- Effects on money and jobs\\n- Effects on fairness between different groups\\n- Effects on the environment\\n\\nThe researchers read all the studies they found. They organized the information to see what had been studied and what was still unknown.\\n\\n## Results\\n\\n### What did the researchers find?\\nThe researchers found 18 studies. These studies used different methods. Some counted and measured things. Some asked people about their experiences. One study used both approaches.\\n\\nMost studies looked at effects on children and teachers. The studies examined many different school rules. Most looked at rules to make contact safer, like wearing masks or cleaning more often.\\n\\n### What unintended effects were found?\\nThe studies reported many different unintended effects:\\n- Eleven studies looked at effects on learning\\n- Seven studies looked at mental health and social effects\\n- Three studies looked at physical health effects\\n- Three studies looked at environmental effects\\n- Two studies looked at money and job effects\\n- No studies looked at fairness between different groups\\n\\nMost of the effects studied were considered harmful rather than helpful.\\n\\n### What do the results mean?\\nThe researchers found that many different unintended effects have been studied. However, the studies were very different from each other. This makes it hard to combine their findings.\\n\\nThere are important gaps in what we know. Very few studies looked at mental health effects. No studies looked at whether school rules affected different groups fairly. Few studies looked at rules that reduce contact between people.\\n\\n### What happens next?\\nMore research is needed. Future studies should focus on specific school rules. They should look at many different unintended effects. Researchers should provide more details about the schools and students they study. This will help leaders make better decisions about school rules in their own communities.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"base_filename\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"10.1002-14651858.CD013276\",\n          \"10.1002-14651858.CD003459\",\n          \"10.1002-14651858.CD015397\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pls\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Physiological track\\u2010and\\u2010trigger/early warning systems for use in maternity care\\nWhat is the question? \\nThe aim of this review is to find out from randomised\\u00a0controlled\\u00a0trials\\u00a0if using simple monitoring tools\\u00a0are helpful in alerting to\\u00a0clinical\\u00a0problems and\\u00a0in reducing serious illness or death in pregnant\\u00a0women and in their\\u00a0first six weeks after birth. Examples of such tools are\\u00a0track and trigger systems or early warning systems kept by the bedside in maternity care. \\nWhy is this important? \\nMany natural functional changes occur in a woman's body during pregnancy. As a result, a pregnant woman, who may appear healthy and well, can become rapidly very sick. This is called clinical deterioration. If not detected sufficiently early and treated successfully, the pregnant woman can become seriously ill or even die. Examples are serious bleeding, development of convulsions when a woman has high blood pressure, blood clots and serious infection. Simple bedside tools or charts can be used by maternity care providers (midwives and doctors) to record information on a woman's health. The recorded health measures include her blood pressure, pulse rate, breathing rate, body temperature, and other health measures such as urine output and mental alertness. The tools have been introduced so that the measures are observed, recorded and interpreted together, rather than as single measures. The intention is to detect when serious illness is, or might be developing. Medical staff can then step in to prevent serious harm.\\u00a0 \\nWhat evidence did we find? \\nWe searched for evidence on 28 May 2021 and identified two studies that compared an early warning system with standard care. One study was a single\\u2010centre study involving 700 women and the second was a stepped\\u2010wedge cluster trial (multiple centres grouped into 'clusters') involving 536,233 women. Different clusters of centres introduced the tool over time until all centres were using the tool. Both studies were carried out in low\\u2010resource healthcare settings. The tools were called the 'Saving Mothers Score' (SMS) and the CRADLE Vital Sign Alert (VSA) device. Risk of bias in the two studies was low or unclear.\\u00a0 \\nWe found that the tools probably do not reduce maternal death. Women may have less serious bleeding (or haemorrhage) when an early warning tool is used. This finding was supported by low\\u2010certainty evidence.\\u00a0We also found that the tools may make little or no difference to a potentially life\\u2010threatening body response to infection (sepsis), to blood pressure with swelling, protein in the urine and convulsions (eclampsia), to a serious illness in pregnancy that affects the blood and the way the liver works (HELLP), or being admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). Use of the tools probably reduces the time a woman stays in hospital (moderate\\u2010certainty evidence). We also found that the tools may make little or no difference to the death of the baby in the first month after birth (neonatal death). This finding was supported by low\\u2010certainty evidence. Neither of the two included studies reported cost outcomes. \\nWhat does this mean? \\nUse of early warning tools for women in maternity care in low\\u2010resource settings\\u00a0may reduce serious bleeding and probably reduces the number of days a woman stays in the hospital but may not reduce maternal or infant deaths. More studies are required on the different early warning systems in low\\u2010resource settings. Studies are also needed in middle\\u2010 and high\\u2010resource settings, and in high\\u2010 and low\\u2010risk pregnant women. \\n\",\n          \"Methotrexate for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease\\nAlthough corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission of Crohn's disease, many patients relapse when steroids are withdrawn or become steroid dependent. Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant side effects. Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug that is used to treat active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. This review includes seven randomized trials with a total of 495 participants. There is evidence from one large study which suggests that methotrexate (25 mg/week) injected intramuscularly for 16 weeks among patients with active treatment resistant Crohn's disease may provide a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids.

Although side effects are more common with high dose methotrexate therapy, no serious side effects have been observed. Common side effects associated with methotrexate therapy include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash and headache. Studies comparing lower dose oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) to placebo (e.g. sugar pill) or other active drugs (e.g. azathioprine or 6\\u2010mercaptopurine) indicate that lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any benefit for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. However, these trials were small in size and further studies of oral methotrexate may be justified. Two studies looked at the combination of methotrexate and infliximab (a biological drug) compared to infliximab therapy alone. These studies indicated that the addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infiximab. However these studies were relatively small and further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies. \\n\",\n          \"Unintended consequences of school\\u2010based measures to manage the COVID\\u201019 pandemic\\nWhy is this question important? \\nCountries worldwide have taken many public health and social measures to prevent and control the spread of SARS\\u2010CoV\\u20102, a highly contagious respiratory virus responsible for COVID\\u201019. A range of measures have been put in place to minimise transmission of SARS\\u2010CoV\\u20102 within schools and the wider community. Schools have the potential to be settings of high viral transmission because they involve extended interactions amongst people in close proximity.\\u00a0A previous review located and examined studies on the effectiveness of such school\\u2010based measures regarding SARS\\u2010CoV\\u20102 transmission. It is equally important to look at their unintended consequences on health and society in order that policymakers and parents can make informed decisions.\\u00a0Unintended consequences of a public health measure may be beneficial or harmful (or a mix of both).\\u00a0A public health measure may result in a mix of benefits and harms. For this review, we planned to examine the unintended consequences of measures designed to prevent and control the spread of SARS\\u2010CoV\\u20102 in schools. This review can therefore be seen as complementing the previous review on the effectiveness of such measures.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\nWhat did we do? \\nFirstly, we searched nine databases for studies that assessed any measure put in place in the school settings (primary or secondary schools, or both) to prevent transmission of the virus. We considered all types of studies and a broad range of outcomes. \\nSecondly, we grouped the identified studies according to the types of measures they examined. We then described which approaches were used in the studies, where these were conducted, and which unintended consequences were evaluated.\\u00a0 \\nWhat did we find? \\nWe found 18 studies that matched our inclusion criteria. Five studies used \\u2018real\\u2010life\\u2019 data (observational studies); five studies used data generated by a computer and based on a set of assumptions (modelling studies); three studies were experimental studies (e.g. laboratory\\u2010based); and four studies used qualitative methods, meaning they based their findings on interviews with people. One study used mixed methods, combining numerical and non\\u2010numerical (qualitative) information.\\u00a0 \\nStudies examined four different types of measures, as follows.\\n\\u2010 Measures to reduce contacts (4 studies): policies to reduce the number of students in the school building (i.e. reducing the number of students present per class) and/or to reduce the number of contacts of students (e.g. through defined groups or staggered arrival, breaks, and departures). \\n\\u2010 Measures to make contacts safer (14 studies): practices to ensure safer contacts between people in the school and classroom setting (e.g. mask mandates or distancing regulations), to modify the environment or activities (e.g. enhanced cleaning or ventilation practices). \\n\\u2010 Surveillance and response measures to detect SARS\\u2010CoV\\u20102 infections (6 studies): testing and/or screening strategies (e.g. temperature taking, screening tests for students and staff, and testing of symptomatic students and staff) and self\\u2010isolation or quarantine measures. \\n\\u2010 Multicomponent measures (1 study): interventions using a combination of at least two of the above measures. \\nWe looked at the following unintended outcomes.\\n\\u2010 Educational consequences (11 studies), e.g. changes in school performance, advancement to the next grade, or change in graduation numbers. \\n\\u2010 Psychosocialoutcomes\\u00a0(7 studies), e.g. mental health, anxieties about going to school. \\n\\u2010 Physical health and health behaviour outcomes beyond COVID\\u201019 (3 studies), e.g. hand eczema due to increased handwashing. \\n\\u2010 Environmental consequences (3 studies), e.g. changes in air quality in classrooms. \\n\\u2010 Socio\\u2010economic consequences (2 studies), e.g. economic burden on families.\\u00a0 \\nWhat did we conclude? \\nWe identified a wide range of unintended consequences of school\\u2010based measures designed to prevent the spread of SARS\\u2010CoV\\u20102. However, the evidence base is small, and there are large gaps where more research is needed. This scoping review is a first step in gauging the extent of those consequences. More research is needed\\u00a0to collect additional information and to enable a more thorough analysis of the evidence. Psychosocial consequences (e.g. mental health issues, depression, loneliness) and equity and equality consequences (e.g. disadvantages for children from low\\u2010income households, unfair distribution of work between genders for parents, are in need of further attention. We recommend that future research look at interventions such as fixed groups, alternating physical presence at school and staggered arrival departure and break times, as well as testing and quarantine measures.\\u00a0 \\nHow up to date is this evidence? \\nThe evidence is up to date to\\u00a0March 2021.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "'# Plain Language Summary: Probiotics for Treating Constipation in Children\\n\\n## Plain Title\\nDo probiotics help children with long-term constipation that has no physical cause?\\n\\n## Rationale\\n\\n**What is the health problem?**\\n\\nSome children have long-term constipation with no physical cause. Doctors call this \"functional constipation.\" These children have trouble pooping regularly, even though tests show nothing is wrong with their body. This problem is very common. Up to 1 in 4 visits to children\\'s gut doctors are because of this issue. It causes a lot of discomfort and worry for children and their families.\\n\\n**Why was this study needed?**\\n\\nOur gut contains tiny living things called bacteria. These bacteria help our body work properly. Probiotics are \"good\" bacteria that people can take as pills or drinks. Scientists think probiotics might help change the mix of bacteria in the gut. This could help the gut work better and make pooping easier.\\n\\n**What did researchers want to find out?**\\n\\nResearchers wanted to know if probiotics are safe and helpful for children with long-term constipation. They looked at whether probiotics could help children poop more often and feel better overall.\\n\\n## Trial Design\\n\\n**How was this study designed?**\\n\\nThis was not a single study. Instead, researchers looked at 14 different studies that other scientists had done. They combined the results to see what the evidence shows.\\n\\n**Who was in these studies?**\\n\\nThe studies included 1,127 children total. All children were between 0 and 18 years old. All had functional constipation, meaning they had trouble pooping but had no physical problem causing it.\\n\\n**What did the studies compare?**\\n\\nThe studies tested different things:\\n- Some compared probiotics to fake pills (called placebo)\\n- Some compared probiotics plus laxatives to laxatives alone\\n- Some compared probiotics to other treatments like magnesium oxide\\n- Two studies tested synbiotics (probiotics mixed with special fiber)\\n\\nLaxatives are medicines that help make pooping easier.\\n\\n**How long did the studies last?**\\n\\nThe length of time varied across different studies.\\n\\n## Results\\n\\n**What did the researchers find?**\\n\\nThe results were mixed and unclear:\\n\\n**Probiotics compared to fake pills:**\\n- We cannot tell if probiotics help children poop more often\\n- Probiotics may not help children feel better overall\\n- Probiotics may not cause more side effects than fake pills\\n\\n**Probiotics plus laxatives compared to laxatives alone:**\\n- Adding probiotics to laxatives may not help children poop more often\\n- Adding probiotics may not help children feel better overall\\n- We are very unsure if adding probiotics causes more side effects\\n\\n**Probiotics compared to magnesium oxide:**\\n- We are very unsure if there is any difference between these treatments\\n- We are very unsure about side effects\\n\\n**Synbiotics (probiotics with special fiber):**\\n- One study found synbiotics may help more children feel better compared to fake pills\\n- No children stopped treatment because of side effects\\n- When compared to paraffin (a type of laxative), we are very unsure if synbiotics work differently\\n\\n**Why are we unsure?**\\n\\nThe studies were small. They tested different types of probiotics. They measured results in different ways. This makes it hard to know what the true answer is.\\n\\n**What about safety?**\\n\\nMost studies said no serious problems happened. This is good news. But we need more research to be sure probiotics are safe.\\n\\n**What does this mean?**\\n\\nRight now, we do not have enough proof to say whether probiotics help children with constipation. One study suggests synbiotics might help, but we need more research to be sure.\\n\\n**What happens next?**\\n\\nScientists need to do more studies. These studies should be larger. They should test the same types of probiotics. They should measure results the same way. This will help us know if probiotics really work for children with constipation.'"

              "\"Background\\nFunctional constipation is defined as chronic constipation with no identifiable underlying cause. It is a significant cause of morbidity in children, accounting for up to 25% of visits to paediatric gastroenterologists. Probiotic preparations may sufficiently alter the gut microbiome and promote normal gut physiology in a way that helps relieve functional constipation. Several studies have sought to address this hypothesis, as well as the role of probiotics in other functional gut disorders. Therefore, it is important to have a focused review to assess the evidence to date. \\nObjectives\\nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of probiotics for the management of chronic constipation without a physical explanation in children. \\nSearch methods\\nOn 28 June 2021, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, WHO ICTR, and ClinicalTrials.gov, with no language, date, publication status, or document type limitations. \\nSelection criteria\\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed probiotic preparations (including synbiotics) compared to placebo, no treatment or any other interventional preparation in people aged between 0 and 18 years old with a diagnosis of functional constipation according to consensus criteria (such as Rome IV). \\nData collection and analysis\\nWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.\\nMain results\\nWe included 14 studies (1127 randomised participants): 12 studies assessed probiotics in the treatment of functional constipation, whilst two studies investigated synbiotic preparations. \\nThree studies compared probiotics to placebo in relation to the frequency of defecation at study end, but we did not pool them as there was very significant unexplained heterogeneity. Four studies compared probiotics to placebo in relation to treatment success. There may be no difference in global improvement/treatment success (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.26; 313 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Five studies compared probiotics to placebo in relation to withdrawals due to adverse events, with the pooled effect suggesting there may be no difference (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.95; 357 participants; low‐certainty evidence). \\nThe pooled estimate from three studies that compared probiotics plus an osmotic laxative to osmotic laxative alone found there may be no difference in frequency of defecation (MD ‐0.01, 95% CI ‐0.57 to 0.56; 268 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Two studies compared probiotics plus an osmotic laxative to osmotic laxative alone in relation to global improvement/treatment success, and found there may be no difference between the treatments (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.15; 139 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Three studies compared probiotics plus osmotic laxative to osmotic laxative alone in relation to withdrawals due to adverse events, but it is unclear if there is a difference between them (RR 2.86, 95% CI 0.12 to 68.35; 268 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). \\nTwo studies compared probiotics versus magnesium oxide. It is unclear if there is a difference in frequency of defecation (MD 0.28, 95% CI ‐0.58 to 1.14; 36 participants), treatment success (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.57; 36 participants) or withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.04; 77 participants). The certainty of the evidence is very low for these outcomes. \\nOne study assessed the role of a synbiotic preparation in comparison to placebo. There may be higher treatment success in favour of synbiotics compared to placebo (RR 2.32, 95% CI 1.54 to 3.47; 155 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The study reported that there were no withdrawals due to adverse effects in either group. \\nOne study assessed a synbiotic plus paraffin compared to paraffin alone. It is uncertain if there is a difference in frequency of defecation (MD 0.74, 95% CI ‐0.96, 2.44; 66 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), or treatment success (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.17; 66 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The study reported that there were no withdrawals due to adverse effects in either group. \\nOne study compared a synbiotic preparation to paraffin. It is uncertain if there is a difference in frequency of defecation (MD ‐1.53, 95% CI ‐3.00, ‐0.06; 60 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) or in treatment success (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.65, 1.13; 60 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The study reported that there were no withdrawals due to adverse effects in either group. \\nAll secondary outcomes were either not reported or reported in a way that did not allow for analysis. \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nThere is insufficient evidence to conclude whether probiotics are efficacious in successfully treating chronic constipation without a physical explanation in children or changing the frequency of defecation, or whether there is a difference in withdrawals due to adverse events when compared with placebo. There is limited evidence from one study to suggest a synbiotic preparation may be more likely than placebo to lead to treatment success, with no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events. \\nThere is insufficient evidence to draw efficacy or safety conclusions about the use of probiotics in combination with or in comparison to any of the other interventions reported. The majority of the studies that presented data on serious adverse events reported that no events occurred. Two studies did not report this outcome. \\nFuture studies are needed to confirm efficacy, but the research community requires guidance on the best context for probiotics in such studies, considering where they should be best considered in a potential treatment hierarchy and should align with core outcome sets to support future interpretation of findings. \\n\""
