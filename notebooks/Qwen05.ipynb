            "Background\n",
            "People who have chronic kidney disease (CKD) have important changes to bone structure, strength, and metabolism. Children experience bone deformity, pain, and delayed or impaired growth. Adults experience limb and vertebral fractures, avascular necrosis, and pain. The fracture risk after kidney transplantation is four times that of the general population and is related to Chronic Kidney Disease‐Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD‐MBD) occurring with end‐stage kidney failure, steroid‐induced bone loss, and persistent hyperparathyroidism after transplantation. Fractures may reduce quality of life and lead to being unable to work or contribute to community roles and responsibilities. Earlier versions of this review have found low certainty evidence for effects of treatment. This is an update of a review first published in 2005 and updated in 2007. \n",
            "Objectives\n",
            "This review update evaluates the benefits and harms of interventions for preventing bone disease following kidney transplantation. \n",
            "Search methods\n",
            "We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 16 May 2019 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. \n",
            "Selection criteria\n",
            "RCTs and quasi‐RCTs evaluating treatments for bone disease among kidney transplant recipients of any age were eligible. \n",
            "Data collection and analysis\n",
            "Two authors independently assessed trial risks of bias and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using random effects meta‐analysis. The risk estimates were expressed as a risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous variables and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes together with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). The primary efficacy outcome was bone fracture. The primary safety outcome was acute graft rejection. Secondary outcomes included death (all cause and cardiovascular), myocardial infarction, stroke, musculoskeletal disorders (e.g. skeletal deformity, bone pain), graft loss, nausea, hyper‐ or hypocalcaemia, kidney function, serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), and bone mineral density (BMD). \n",
            "Main results\n",
            "In this 2019 update, 65 studies (involving 3598 participants) were eligible; 45 studies contributed data to our meta‐analyses (2698 participants). Treatments included bisphosphonates, vitamin D compounds, teriparatide, denosumab, cinacalcet, parathyroidectomy, and calcitonin. Median duration of follow‐up was 12 months. Forty‐three studies evaluated bone density or bone‐related biomarkers, with more recent studies evaluating proteinuria and hyperparathyroidism. Bisphosphonate therapy was usually commenced in the perioperative transplantation period (within 3 weeks) and regardless of BMD. Risks of bias were generally high or unclear leading to lower certainty in the results. A single study reported outcomes among 60 children and adolescents. Studies were not designed to measure treatment effects on fracture, death or cardiovascular outcomes, or graft loss. \n",
            "Compared to placebo, bisphosphonate therapy administered over 12 months in transplant recipients may prevent fracture (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.01; low certainty evidence) although the 95% CI included the possibility that bisphosphonate therapy might make little or no difference. Fracture events were principally vertebral fractures identified during routine radiographic surveillance. It was uncertain whether any other drug class decreased fracture (low or very low certainty evidence). It was uncertain whether interventions for bone disease in kidney transplantation reduce all‐cause or cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke, or graft loss in very low certainty evidence. Bisphosphonate therapy may decrease acute graft rejection (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.89; low certainty evidence), while it is uncertain whether any other treatment impacts graft rejection (very low certainty evidence). Bisphosphonate therapy may reduce bone pain (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.93; very low certainty evidence), while it was very uncertain whether bisphosphonates prevent spinal deformity or avascular bone necrosis (very low certainty evidence). Bisphosphonates may increase to risk of hypocalcaemia (RR 5.59, 95% CI 1.00 to 31.06; low certainty evidence). It was uncertain whether vitamin D compounds had any effect on skeletal, cardiovascular, death, or transplant function outcomes (very low certainty or absence of evidence). Evidence for the benefits and harms of all other treatments was of very low certainty. Evidence for children and young adolescents was sparse. \n",
            "Authors' conclusions\n",
            "Bisphosphonate therapy may reduce fracture and bone pain after kidney transplantation, however low certainty in the evidence indicates it is possible that treatment may make little or no difference. It is uncertain whether bisphosphonate therapy or other bone treatments prevent other skeletal complications after kidney transplantation, including spinal deformity or avascular bone necrosis. The effects of bone treatment for children and adolescents after kidney transplantation are very uncertain.\n",

              "Recurrent urinary tract infections (RUTI) are common in women generally, and particularly in pregnant women. A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection of the urinary tract (bladder, kidneys) due to the presence of bacteria in the urine (bacteriuria). During pregnancy, UTI may be a serious complication that is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes for both mother and child including preterm birth and small‐for‐gestational‐age babies. Therefore, it is important to define the optimal intervention for preventing RUTI during pregnancy to improve pregnancy outcomes. Interventions used to prevent RUTI in pregnant women can be pharmacological (antibiotics) or non‐pharmacological (cranberry products, acupuncture, probiotics and behavioural modifications). So far, little is known about the best way to prevent RUTI in pregnant women. \n",
              "This review identified one study involving 200 pregnant women who received nitrofurantoin (antibiotics) and close surveillance (regular clinic visit, urine cultures and antibiotics when a positive culture was found) or close surveillance alone. Suppressive therapy with daily dose of nitrofurantoin and close surveillance was not shown to prevent RUTI compared with close surveillance alone but the evidence was of very low quality. A significant reduction of asymptomatic bacteriuria (presence of bacteria in the urine without the symptoms of a UTI) was found in women with a high clinic attendance rate who received nitrofurantoin and close surveillance. Due to lack of evidence no conclusions can be drawn. Future randomised controlled trials comparing different pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions are necessary to assess the optimal intervention to prevent RUTI in women who are pregnant. Such trials should report on a comprehensive range of outcomes for both women and infants.\n",

It is often given together with another antibiotic called penicillin, to prevent other types of bacteria from causing infection. People sometimes take it instead of antibiotics alone if they are allergic to antibiotics. The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether taking nitroficotide once a day reduces the number of people developing kidney infections in women. \n",
              "BackgroundIt is common for women to develop a kidney infection during pregnancy (pyelone磷酸yte). Most commonly it is caused by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, but can also be caused by Streptomytecin, Escherichillardia and Kleoporthyla. Treatment usually involves antibiotics taken orally. Nitroacicid is an antibiotic that blocks some of the harmful effects of the different types of toxin produced by bacteria. It was first developed in the late 1950s. \n",
              "MethodsThis was a randomised control trial. Women aged 18 years and over who had been diagnosed with chronic pyelONEstinosis (which means that the kidneys have become diseased and produce too much calcium and bicarbonate, leading to a build-up of waste products in the urine) and who did not smoke or drink alcohol were invited to join the trial. They were randomly allocated either to take nitroacicidia orally every day for four months or to continue with normal treatment. The trials ended after six months. The outcomes measured were developing kidney infection each year, and how long it took for the infection to resolve itself. \n",
              "ResultsThere were 116 women in the trial, of whom 58 were treated with nitaroxicidia. Of these, 28 (52%) resolved themselves within three months, and 26 (53%) remained healthy afterwards. 40 (35%) died each year due to kidney disease, and none (none%) became infected. The majority of those treated with nitrogenacidides (25) were male, and were in good general health when they started treatment. One woman died each week, and there were no cases of resistance to the antibiotics occurring. The study showed that taking nitrocitantidia once a-day was safe and effective for treating kidney infections during pregnancy. \n",

              "A cleft palate means that during the early stages of pregnancy, the baby’s roof of the mouth does not join in the normal way. The lip is sometimes cleft as well as the palate. Children who are born with a cleft lip or palate usually have corrective surgery during the first few years of life. Nowadays, surgery is so good that there are few long term consequences. \n",
              "However, some children with repaired cleft palate can have difficulties with speech as they get older. One type of speech difficulty affects consonants formed by the tongue in the mouth, such as /t/, /d/, /s/. This makes words like “toe”, “door” and “sun” sound distorted or even unrecognisable to listeners. These consonants can be difficult to correct, even by experienced speech and language therapists. Any long term speech difficulties are likely to have a negative effect on children’s social, psychological and educational development and future prospects. \n",
              "One technique that may help to correct these abnormal articulations is electropalatography or EPG. EPG is a computer‐based technique that can display the tongue's contact with the hard palate (roof of the mouth) during speech. It involves the child wearing an adapted dental plate, with sensors on the surface. When the tongue contacts the sensors, distinctive patterns for consonants are displayed on a computer screen. The patterns can be used in speech therapy to provide visual feedback so that children can learn normal patterns for consonants they find difficult. \n",

When the knee is fully extended, the ball of the thigh bone (thigh bone extension) moves towards the leg (abduction). This movement is produced by several muscles, including the quadriceps muscle group located on the front of the body and the patellar tendon (the \"knee tendon\"). At the same time, the femoral bone (大腿骨）moves laterally (to the side) through the acetabulum (耻骨），which is situated above the hip socket. This movement produces the action of 'gliding', which causes the bones of the lower limb to move backwards, resulting in the term'swipe'. The knee also rotates (flexion) when the foot is turned inward (internal rotation). The knee does this because of the iliotibial band (a band of muscles located across the outer thigh) which stretches back over the fibula (shinbone), causing the knee to rotate outward. The knee can also be rotated to the left or right (external or internal rotations). \n",

Meningitis is the most common manifestation of invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis). Other clinical manifestations include septicaemia, conjunctivitis, pericarditis and arthritis. Meningitis and septicaemia can be rapidly fatal if untreated. N. meningitidis is a normal commensal of the throat and may be found in about 10% of a healthy population. Reasons why the bacteria may become invasive to cause disease are unclear. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) showed that the polysaccharide serogroup A vaccine prevented meningitis caused by the serogroup A strain of meningococci, and the vaccine has since been used effectively to control epidemics. However, observational studies suggested variations in the level and duration of protection, particularly among younger children, thus resulting in different interpretations of the potential value of routine vaccinations. The review was conducted to provide a summary estimate of the efficacy of the vaccine, its effectiveness in children under five years old, and its duration of protection. Results from 8 out of 12 eligible RCTs were included, and showed the vaccine highly protective in the first year after vaccination: the summary estimate of efficacy was 95% (95% confidence interval (CI) 87% to 99%). Although protection extended to the third year after vaccination, the results were not statistically significant. The vaccine was protective in Finnish children aged three months to five years, but the effect of a booster dose in children under two years was not statistically significant. The vaccine was protective in one‐ to five‐year old children in low‐income countries but its effectiveness by one or two‐year age strata in this age group could not be determined.

              "The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether placing primary care professionals, such as general practitioners, in the hospital emergency department (ED) to provide care for patients with non‐urgent health problems can decrease resource use and costs. We searched for and analysed published and unpublished studies and found four relevant studies. This is the first update of a previously published Cochrane Review. \n",

              "We cannot be sure whether placing primary care professionals in the ED to provide care for patients with non‐urgent problems is as effective or safe as regularly scheduled emergency physician care, as we found little evidence with inconsistent results, which we assessed as of very low certainty. Safety has not been examined. \n",
              "What was studied in the review? \n",
              "In many countries, EDs are under a lot of pressure due to high patient attendance, resulting in long waits. One way of solving this problem may be to place primary care professionals in EDs to provide care for patients who do not have problems assessed as urgent at arrival. It has been suggested that this would make emergency physicians more available to provide care to more serious cases, thus decreasing resource use and costs. \n",
              "What are the main results of the review? \n",
              "This review included one randomised and three non‐randomised studies, involving a total of 11,463 patients, 16 general practitioners, nine emergency nurse practitioners, and 69 emergency physicians. Studies were conducted in Ireland, the UK, and Australia, with money given by national or regional health authorities and a medical research funding body. We could not combine the results due to differences among the studies. Because the evidence we found was of very low certainty, we cannot be certain if the intervention makes any difference to waiting times or total length of ED stay (1 study; 260 participants), admissions to hospital, diagnostic tests, treatments given, consultations or referrals to hospital‐based specialists (3 studies; 11,203 participants), as well as costs (2 studies; 9325 participants). None of the included studies provided data on adverse events. \n",

A solution could be to place doctors directly into stations where patients come to the center after they have been admitted in the hospital. This would allow doctors to see more patients quickly, reducing the time between arriving at the station and starting treatment, and allowing more time for other staff to provide support to patients. The goal of this Cochrana Review was to compare the ways in which placing GCPs into non-EHR stations might help relieve those pressures. \n",
