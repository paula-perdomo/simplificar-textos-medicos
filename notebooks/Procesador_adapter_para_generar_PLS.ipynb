This review identified two randomised controlled trials including a total of 90 participants. One study compared twice weekly treatment with helminths (an 0.8 mL solution containing 2500 live eggs of the helminth Trichuris suis) for 12 weeks to a matching placebo (an 0.8 ml identical looking solution with no Trichuris suis eggs) in 54 patients with active ulcerative colitis. Few remissions occurred during the trial and helminth treatment had no detectable effect on these remissions. Ten per cent (3/30) of patients in the helminth group achieved remission compared to four per cent (1/24) of placebo patients. A higher proportion of patients in the helminth group (43% or 13/30) improved clinically compared to the placebo group (17% or 4/24). However, this difference could be a chance effect. We could not determine whether the proportion of patients who had a side effect was higher in either group. No observed side effects were thought to be related to treatment were reported in this study. The other study compared one treatment with various doses of helminths (a solution of 500, 2500 or 7500 Trichuris suis eggs) to a matching placebo in 36 patients with Crohn's disease. This study was designed to assess side effects and did not measure clinical remission or improvement. There amount of information available on side\\u2010effects at two weeks was limited and the results were uncertain due to the small number of participants in the study. The only side effect that was judged to be possibly related to the study treatment was dysgeusia (a distortion of the sense of taste). This was reported in one patient in the helminth group and in one patient in the placebo group. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to allow any firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness and safety of helminths used to treat patients with IBD. The only information available relating to clinical improvement in patients with active ulcerative colitis comes from one small study. We do not know how safe helminths are when used in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Further randomised controlled trials are required to assess the efficacy and safety of helminth therapy in IBD.\",\n          \"Benzodiazepines alone or in combination with antipsychotic drugs for acute psychosis\\nReview question \\nThe aim of this review was to compare the tranquillising (calming) or sedative (sleepiness) effects of benzodiazepines, given alone or combined with other drugs compared with the effect of placebo (a pretend treatment), other drugs or non\\u2010drug treatments for people who are aggressive or agitated because they are experiencing psychoses. \\nBackground \\nAcute psychosis is a rapid worsening of a person\\u2019s mental state where touch with reality is often lost. People may experience frightening delusions or hallucinations which are distressing and may cause agitated or aggressive behaviour. In urgent cases, this agitation or aggression may cause harm to the person experiencing the psychoses or others around them. To avoid such harm, rapid tranquillisation or sedation with medicines may be required. The most common medicines used to achieve a state of calmness or sedation are benzodiazepines and these can be given either alone or in combination with antipsychotics. \\nSearching \\nThe original search for this review was carried out in January 2012 and subsequently two further update searches were run in August 2015 and August 2016. In total, these searches found 2497 records, which the review authors checked for inclusion or exclusion from the review. Authors included records only if they were randomised trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that allocated people with acute psychosis who presented with agitation, violence aggressive behaviour (or a combination of these) to receive benzodiazepines either given alone or combined with any antipsychotics, versus placebo, antipsychotics alone or in combination with other antipsychotics/benzodiazepines/antihistamines or non\\u2010drug treatments. \\nEvidence found \\nIn total, 20 trials were included. Overall, the quality of evidence was low or very low due to serious risk of bias and very small size of included trials. There was no clear difference in improvement between benzodiazepines and placebo, benzodiazepines and antipsychotics or benzodiazepines plus antipsychotics and benzodiazepines alone or antipsychotic alone. When benzodiazepines were compared with combined antipsychotics/antihistamines, there was a higher risk of no improvement in people receiving benzodiazepine alone but the evidence was of low quality. Only one study showed lower effect of combined benzodiazepines/antipsychotics versus combined antihistamines/antipsychotics. However, the evidence was of very low quality. In terms of side effects, people receiving benzodiazepines compared to antipsychotics had lower risk of presenting with symptoms such as shaking, tremors and slurred speech whereas the results for the sedation caused were unclear. \\nConclusions \\nThe existing trials are not informative enough to support or refute the use of benzodiazepines alone or in additional to other medicines when urgent tranquillisation or sedation with medicines is required. Although benzodiazepines alone may cause fewer side effects compared to older antipsychotics, when they are added on to other medicines this may lead to unnecessary side effects. Further studies are needed to provide good\\u2010quality evidence with robust conclusions to inform clinical practice and policies around rapid tranquillisation for people with psychoses who are aggressive or agitated.\",\n          \"Effectiveness of angioplasty compared with stenting in atherosclerotic disease of the iliac arteries \\nBackground \\nAtherosclerosis in the iliac artery (main pelvic artery towards the leg) may result in narrowing or obstruction (occlusion), leading to reduced blood flow to the leg. This is called iliac artery occlusive disease. Iliac artery occlusive disease may lead to symptoms of pain in the legs when walking (intermittent claudication), pain at rest, or ulcers of the foot or leg. A range of surgical and endovascular (from inside the artery, e.g. angioplasty) treatment options are available. Open surgical procedures have excellent patency rates (percentage of the vessels that remain open) but at the cost of substantial illness and death. Endovascular treatment has good safety and short\\u2010term effectiveness with decreased illness, complications and costs compared with open surgical procedures. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA; dilation of the artery with a balloon) and stenting (insertion of a small mesh tube) are widely used endovascular treatment options for iliac artery occlusive disease. A narrowing or obstruction of the iliac artery can be treated successfully by PTA alone. If PTA alone is not successful, an additional stent can be placed. Alternatively, a stent could be placed on its own to treat an iliac narrowing or obstruction (this is called primary stenting (PS)). However, there is limited evidence to prove which endovascular treatment strategy is better for lesions that restrict the iliac arteries. This review investigates whether it is better to place a stent in the first instance, or only under particular circumstances. \\nStudy characteristics and key results \\nWe found no new studies for this update. Previously, we had identified two studies with a combined total of 397 participants relevant to this topic. Combining the data was not possible due to the differences between the two included studies. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to 24 September 2019. \\nFor the following outcomes of interest, no clear differences emerged between the two types of treatment: technical success of the procedure, improvement in the severity of the arterial occlusive disease, or patency of the treated vessel. However, in one study, which only included iliac artery occlusions, fewer complications were observed in the group of participants treated with PS. Neither study reported on delayed complications. One study reported on reintervention, and resolution of symptoms and signs, with no evidence of a difference detected between the PS group and the PTA group. Neither study reported on improvement in walking distance. More research on this subject is necessary. \\nReliability of the evidence \\nBoth studies had some risk of bias relating to selective reporting and non\\u2010blinding of participants and personnel. Both studies occurred in the 1990s and techniques have since evolved. We considered the overall certainty of the evidence to be low due to this risk of bias, the small number of included studies and the differences in the types of patients that were included.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"non_pls\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Two RCTs (90 participants) were included.

The other RCT was a phase one that assessed the safety and tolerability of T. suis ova in patients with CD (n = 36). The risk of bias in both studies was judged to be low. In the UC study, during the 12\\u2010week study period, participants in the active arm received 2\\u2010weekly aliquots of 2500 T. suis eggs, added to 0.8 mL of saline; those in the placebo arm received 0.8 mL saline only. There were sparse data available for the outcomes clinical remission and clinical improvement. Ten per cent (3/30) of patients in the T. suis arm entered remission compared to 4% (1/24) of patients in the placebo arm (RR 2.40, 95% CI 0.27 to 21.63). Forty\\u2010three per cent (13/30) of patients in the T. suis group achieved clinical improvement compared to 17% (4/24) of placebo patients (RR 2.60, 95% CI 0.97 to 6.95). The mean ulcerative colitis disease activity index (UCDAI) score was lower in the T. suis group (6.1 +/\\u2010 0.61) compared to the placebo group (7.5 +/\\u2010 0.66) after 12 weeks of treatment (MD \\u20101.40, 95% CI \\u20101.75 to \\u20101.05). There was only limited evidence relating to the proportion of patients who experienced an adverse event. Three per cent (1/30) of patients in the T. suis group experienced at least one adverse event compared to 12% (3/24) of placebo patients (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.40). None of the adverse events reported in this study were judged to be related to the study treatment. GRADE analyses rated the overall quality of the evidence for the primary and secondary outcomes (i.e. clinical remission and improvement) as low due to serious imprecision. In the CD study, participants received a single treatment of T. suis ova at a dosage of 500 (n = 9), 2500 (n = 9), or 7500 (n = 9) embryonated eggs or matching placebo (n = 9). The CD study did not assess clinical remission or improvement as outcomes. There were sparse data on adverse events at two weeks. Thirty\\u2010seven per cent (10/27) of patients in the T. suis group experienced at least one adverse event compared to 44% (4/9) of placebo patients (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.01). Only one adverse event (dysgeusia) was judged to be possibly related to treatment in this study. Dysgeusia was reported in one patient in the T. suis group and in one patient in the placebo group.\",\n          \"Background\\nAcute psychotic illness, especially when associated with agitated or violent behaviour, can require urgent pharmacological tranquillisation or sedation. In several countries, clinicians often use benzodiazepines (either alone or in combination with antipsychotics) for this outcome. \\nObjectives\\nTo examine whether benzodiazepines, alone or in combination with other pharmacological agents, is an effective treatment for psychosis\\u2010induced aggression or agitation when compared with placebo, other pharmacological agents (alone or in combination) or non\\u2010pharmacological approaches. \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register (January 2012, 20 August 2015 and 3 August 2016), inspected reference lists of included and excluded studies, and contacted authors of relevant studies. \\nSelection criteria\\nWe included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing benzodiazepines alone or in combination with any antipsychotics, versus antipsychotics alone or in combination with any other antipsychotics, benzodiazepines or antihistamines, for people who were aggressive or agitated due to psychosis. \\nData collection and analysis\\nWe reliably selected studies, quality assessed them and extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated standard estimates of risk ratio (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed\\u2010effect model. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) between groups. If there was heterogeneity, this was explored using a random\\u2010effects model. We assessed risk of bias and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. \\nMain results\\nTwenty trials including 695 participants are now included in the review. The trials compared benzodiazepines or benzodiazepines plus an antipsychotic with placebo, antipsychotics, antihistamines, or a combination of these. The quality of evidence for the main outcomes was low or very low due to very small sample size of included studies and serious risk of bias (randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding were not well conducted in the included trials, 30% of trials (six out of 20) were supported by pharmaceutical institutes). There was no clear effect for most outcomes. \\nBenzodiazepines versus placebo\\nOne trial compared benzodiazepines with placebo. There was no difference in the number of participants sedated at 24 hours (very low quality evidence). However, for the outcome of global state, clearly more people receiving placebo showed no improvement in the medium term (one to\\u00a048 hours) (n = 102, 1 RCT, RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.97, very low quality evidence).  Benzodiazepines versus antipsychotics \\nWhen compared with haloperidol, there was no observed effect for benzodiazepines for sedation by 16 hours (n = 434, 8 RCTs, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.54, low quality evidence). There was no difference in the number of participants who had not improved in the medium term (n = 188, 5 RCTs, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.11, low quality evidence). However, one small study found fewer participants improved when receiving benzodiazepines compared with olanzapine (n = 150, 1 RCT, RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.18, very low quality evidence). People receiving benzodiazepines were less likely to experience\\u00a0extrapyramidal\\u00a0effects in the medium term compared to people receiving haloperidol (n = 233, 6 RCTs, RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.41, low quality evidence). \\nBenzodiazepines versus combined antipsychotics/antihistamines\\nWhen benzodiazepine was compared with combined antipsychotics/antihistamines (haloperidol plus promethazine), there was a higher risk of no improvement in people receiving benzodiazepines in the medium term (n = 200, 1 RCT, RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.05, low quality evidence). However, for sedation, the results were controversial between two groups: lorazepam may lead to lower risk of sedation than combined antipsychotics/antihistamines (n = 200, 1 RCT, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.98, low quality evidence); while, midazolam may lead to higher risk of sedation than combined antipsychotics/antihistamines (n = 200, 1 RCT, RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.23, low quality evidence). \\nOther combinations\\nData comparing benzodiazepines plus antipsychotics versus benzodiazepines alone did not yield any results with clear differences; all were very low quality evidence. When comparing combined benzodiazepines/antipsychotics (all studies compared haloperidol) with the same antipsychotics alone (haloperidol), there was no difference between groups in improvement in the medium term (n = 185, 4\\u00a0RCTs, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.46, low quality evidence), but sedation was more likely in people who received the combination therapy (n = 172, 3\\u00a0RCTs, RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.67,very low quality evidence). Only one study compared combined benzodiazepine/antipsychotics with antipsychotics; however, this study did not report our primary outcomes. One small study compared combined benzodiazepines/antipsychotics with combined antihistamines/antipsychotics. Results showed a higher risk of no clinical improvement (n = 60, 1 RCT, RR 25.00, 95% CI 1.55 to 403.99, very low quality evidence) and sedation status (n = 60, 1 RCT, RR 12.00, 95% CI 1.66 to 86.59, very low quality evidence) in the combined benzodiazepines/antipsychotics group. \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nThe evidence from RCTs for the use of benzodiazepines alone is not good. There were relatively few good data. Most trials were too small to highlight differences in either positive or negative effects. Adding a benzodiazepine to other drugs does not seem to confer clear advantage and has potential for adding unnecessary adverse effects. Sole use of older antipsychotics unaccompanied by anticholinergic drugs seems difficult to justify. Much more high\\u2010quality research is still needed in this area.\",\n          \"There was no evidence of a difference following percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with selective stenting compared to primary stenting (PS) in technical success rates in either the study involving stenotic lesions (odds ratio (OR) 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 2.99; 279 participants; low certainty evidence); or the study involving iliac artery occlusions (OR 2.95, 95% CI 0.12 to 73.90; 112 participants; low certainty evidence). In one trial, PTA of iliac artery occlusions resulted in a higher rate of major complications, especially distal embolisation (OR 4.50 95% CI 1.18 to 17.14; 1 study, 112 participants; low certainty evidence). Immediate complications were similar in the second study (OR 1.81, 95% CI 0.64 to 5.13; 1 study, 279 participants; low certainty evidence). Neither study reported on delayed complications. No evidence of a difference was seen in symptomatic improvement (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.27; 1 study, 157 participants; low certainty evidence). The second study did not provide data but reported no differences. For the outcome of patency, no evidence of a difference was seen in the study involving iliac occlusion at two years (OR 1.60, 95% CI 0.34 to 7.44; 1 study, 57 participants; low certainty evidence); or the study involving stenotic lesions at two years (71.3% in the PS group versus 69.9% in the PTA group). Only one study reported on reintervention (six to eight years, OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.23; 1 study, 279 participants; low certainty evidence); and resolution of symptoms and signs (12 months, OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.00; 1 study, 219 participants; low certainty evidence), with no evidence of a difference detected in either outcome. Neither study reported on improvement in walking distance as reported by the patient.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Atherectomy is an alternative procedure, in which atheroma is cut or ground away within the artery. This is the first update of a Cochrane Review published in 2014. \\nObjectives\\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of atherectomy for peripheral arterial disease compared to other established treatments. \\nSearch methods\\nThe Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED) databases, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 12 August 2019. \\nSelection criteria\\nWe included all randomised controlled trials that compared atherectomy with other established treatments. All participants had symptomatic PAD with either claudication or critical limb ischaemia and evidence of lower limb arterial disease. \\nData collection and analysis\\nTwo review authors screened studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and used GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence. We resolved any disagreements through discussion. Outcomes of interest were: primary patency (at six and 12 months), all\\u2010cause mortality, fatal and non\\u2010fatal cardiovascular events, initial technical failure rates, target vessel revascularisation rates (TVR; at six and 12 months); and complications. \\nMain results\\nWe included seven studies, with a total of 527 participants and 581 treated lesions. We found two comparisons: atherectomy versus balloon angioplasty (BA) and atherectomy versus BA with primary stenting. No studies compared atherectomy with bypass surgery. Overall, the evidence from this review was of very low certainty, due to a high risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency. \\nSix studies (372 participants, 427 treated lesions) compared atherectomy versus BA. We found no clear difference between atherectomy and BA for the primary outcomes: six\\u2010month primary patency rates (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 1.20; 3 studies, 186 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence); 12\\u2010month primary patency rates (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.84; 2 studies, 149 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) or mortality rates (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.66, 3 studies, 210 participants, very low\\u2010certainty evidence). One study reported cardiac failure and acute coronary syndrome as causes of death at 24 months but it was unclear which arm the participants belonged to, and one study reported no cardiovascular events. \\nThere was no clear difference when examining: initial technical failure rates (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.08; 6 studies, 425 treated vessels; very low\\u2010certainty evidence), six\\u2010month TVR (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.06 to 4.42; 2 studies, 136 treated vessels; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) or 12\\u2010month TVR (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.42; 3 studies, 176 treated vessels; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). All six studies reported complication rates (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.68; 6 studies, 387 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) and embolisation events (RR 2.51, 95% CI 0.64 to 9.80; 6 studies, 387 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). Atherectomy may be less likely to cause dissection (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.54; 4 studies, 290 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) and may be associated with a reduction in bailout stenting (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.74; 4 studies, 315 treated vessels; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). Four studies reported amputation rates, with only one amputation event recorded in a BA participant. We used subgroup analysis to compare the effect of plain balloons/stents and drug\\u2010eluting balloons/stents, but did not detect any differences between the subgroups. \\nOne study (155 participants, 155 treated lesions) compared atherectomy versus BA and primary stenting, so comparison was extremely limited and subject to imprecision. This study did not report primary patency. The study reported one death (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.23; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) and three complication events (RR 7.04, 95% CI 0.80 to 62.23; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) in a very small data set, making conclusions unreliable. We found no clear difference between the treatment arms in cardiovascular events (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.23; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). This study found no initial technical failure events, and TVR rates at six and 24 months showed little difference between treatment arms (RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.95 to 5.46; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence and RR 2.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 4.37; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence, respectively). \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nThis review update shows that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of atherectomy on patency, mortality and cardiovascular event rates compared to plain balloon angioplasty, with or without stenting. We detected no clear differences in initial technical failure rates or TVR, but there may be reduced dissection and bailout stenting after atherectomy although this is uncertain. Included studies were small, heterogenous and at high risk of bias. Larger studies powered to detect clinically meaningful, patient\\u2010centred outcomes are required.\",\n          \"The review included one trial involving 200 women and was at moderate to high risk of bias.The trial compared a daily dose of nitrofurantoin and close surveillance (regular clinic visit, urine cultures and antibiotics when a positive culture was found) with close surveillance only. No significant differences were found for the primary outcomes: recurrent pyelonephritis (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 2.53; one study, 167 women), RUTI before birth (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.38; one study, 167 women), and preterm birth (before 37 weeks) (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.35; one study, 147 women). The overall quality of evidence for these outcomes as assessed using GRADE was very low. There were no significant differences between the two comparison groups for any of the following secondary outcomes, birthweight less than 2500 (g) (RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.53 to 7.80; one study, 147 infants), birthweight (mean difference (MD) \\u2010113.00, 95% CI \\u2010327.20 to 101.20; one study, 147 infants), five\\u2010minute Apgar score less than seven (RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.87; one study, 147 infants) and miscarriages (RR 3.11, 95% CI 0.33 to 29.29; one study, 167 women). The evidence for these secondary outcomes was also of very low quality. The incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) (at least 103 colonies per mL) (secondary outcome), only reported in women with a clinic attendance rate of more than 90% (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.89; one study, 102 women), was significantly reduced in women who received nitrofurantoin and close surveillance. Data on total mortality and small\\u2010for\\u2010gestational\\u2010age babies were not reported.\",\n          \"Background\\nCancer increases the risk of thromboembolic events, especially in people receiving anticoagulation treatments. \\nObjectives\\nTo compare the efficacy and safety of low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), and other anticoagulants for the long\\u2010term treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in people with cancer. \\nSearch methods\\nWe conducted a literature search including a comprehensive electronic search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ), MEDLINE (Ovid), and Embase (Ovid); handsearching conference proceedings; checking references of included studies; and a search for ongoing studies in trial registries. As part of the living systematic review approach, we run searches continually, incorporating new evidence after it is identified. Last search date 14 May 2021. \\nSelection criteria\\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the benefits and harms of long\\u2010term treatment with LMWHs, DOACs, VKAs, or other anticoagulants in people with cancer and symptomatic VTE. \\nData collection and analysis\\nWe extracted data in duplicate on study characteristics and risk of bias. Outcomes included: all\\u2010cause mortality, recurrent VTE, major bleeding, minor bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and health\\u2010related quality of life (QoL). We assessed the certainty of the evidence at the outcome level following the GRADE approach (GRADE handbook). \\nMain results\\nOf 3583 citations,19 RCTs fulfilled the eligibility criteria.\\nLow molecular weight heparins versus vitamin K antagonistsEight studies enrolling 2327 participants compared LMWHs with VKAs. Meta\\u2010analysis of five studies probably did not rule out a beneficial or harmful effect of LMWHs compared to VKAs on mortality up to 12 months of follow\\u2010up (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.13; risk difference (RD) 0 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 45 fewer to 48 more; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence). Meta\\u2010analysis of four studies did not rule out a beneficial or harmful effect of LMWHs compared to VKAs on major bleeding (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.12; RD 4 more per 1000, 95% CI 19 fewer to 48 more, moderate\\u2010certainty evidence) or minor bleeding (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.27; RD 38 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 92 fewer to 47 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence), or thrombocytopenia (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.69). Meta\\u2010analysis of five studies showed that LMWHs probably reduced the recurrence of VTE compared to VKAs (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.77; RD 53 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 29 fewer to 72 fewer, moderate\\u2010certainty evidence). \\nDirect oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonistsFive studies enrolling 982 participants compared DOACs with VKAs. Meta\\u2010analysis of four studies may not rule out a beneficial or harmful effect of DOACs compared to VKAs on mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.21; RD 12 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 51 fewer to 37 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence), recurrent VTE (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.31; RD 14 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 27 fewer to 12 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence), major bleeding (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.57, RD 8 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 22 fewer to 20 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence), or minor bleeding (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.22; RD 21 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 54 fewer to 28 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence). One study reporting on DOAC versus VKA was published as abstract so is not included in the main analysis. \\nDirect oral anticoagulants versus low molecular weight heparinsTwo studies enrolling 1455 participants compared DOAC with LMWH. The study by Raskob did not rule out a beneficial or harmful effect of DOACs compared to LMWH on mortality up to 12 months of follow\\u2010up (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.25; RD 27 more per 1000, 95% CI 30 fewer to 95 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence). The data also showed that DOACs may have shown a likely reduction in VTE recurrence up to 12 months of follow\\u2010up compared to LMWH (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.01; RD 36 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 62 fewer to 1 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence). DOAC may have increased major bleeding at 12 months of follow\\u2010up compared to LMWH (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.88; RD 29 more per 1000, 95% CI 0 fewer to 78 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence) and likely increased minor bleeding up to 12 months of follow\\u2010up compared to LMWH (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.80; RD 35 more per 1000, 95% CI 6 fewer to 92 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence). The second study on DOAC versus LMWH was published as an abstract and is not included in the main analysis. \\nIdraparinux versus vitamin K antagonistsOne RCT with 284 participants compared once\\u2010weekly subcutaneous injection of idraparinux versus standard treatment (parenteral anticoagulation followed by warfarin or acenocoumarol) for three or six months. The data probably did not rule out a beneficial or harmful effect of idraparinux compared to VKAs on mortality at six months (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.59; RD 31 more per 1000, 95% CI 62 fewer to 167 more; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence), VTE recurrence at six months (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.32; RD 42 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 65 fewer to 25 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence) or major bleeding (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.35 to 3.56; RD 4 more per 1000, 95% CI 25 fewer to 98 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence). \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nFor the long\\u2010term treatment of VTE in people with cancer, evidence shows that LMWHs compared to VKAs probably produces an important reduction in VTE and DOACs compared to LMWH, may likely reduce VTE but may increase risk of major bleeding. Decisions for a person with cancer and VTE to start long\\u2010term LMWHs versus oral anticoagulation should balance benefits and harms and integrate the person's values and preferences for the important outcomes and alternative management strategies. \\nEditorial note: this is a living systematic review (LSR).

People with this condition can experience pain on walking, pain at rest, or leg ulceration due to poor blood supply. Treatment options are: surgery, using a blood vessel or graft to bypass the narrowed or blocked section of the artery; balloon angioplasty, when a deflated balloon is passed into the narrowing at the end of a wire, then blown up to stretch the artery; and stenting (used in addition to balloon angioplasty), which holds open the balloon\\u2010stretched section for extra support. A final option, less commonly used, is a technique called atherectomy. This treatment cuts or grinds away the fatty deposition (atheroma) within the artery that is causing the narrowing or occlusion. \\nKey results \\nIn this review, we compared atherectomy with the other treatment options described above. We also looked within the two groups to assess whether using drug\\u2010releasing balloons or stents impacted on participants' outcomes. We identified seven studies with a total of 527 participants. \\nSix trials compared atherectomy against balloon angioplasty (372 participants, 427 treated lesions). We found no clear difference between the procedures when examining artery patency at six and 12 months, risk of death, initial procedure failure rates, need to re\\u2010treat the artery, risk of forming clots (embolisation), complication rates or risk of amputation. We found that atherectomy was associated with lower rates of emergency stenting during the procedure and lower balloon inflation pressures when compared with balloon angioplasty alone. We found no difference in results depending on whether the balloons were drug\\u2010releasing or not. \\nOne study compared atherectomy against balloon angioplasty and primary stenting (155 participants and 155 treated lesions). This study did not report primary patency. We found no clear difference between the treatment arms in risk of death, complication rates, cardiovascular events and the need to re\\u2010treat the artery. This study found no initial procedure failure events, \\nWe did not find any studies that compared bypass surgery against atherectomy.\\nCertainty of the evidence \\nOverall, our certainty in the evidence is very low, which means we do not have confidence that our results show the true effect of the treatments. We downgraded our certainty in the evidence because the studies were at high risk of bias (lack of blinding of participants or assessors, several outcomes were not reported and a number of the participants did not complete the studies); the trials were all small; and their results were inconsistent. \\nConclusions \\nIn conclusion, we have found no clear difference in effect on patency, mortality or cardiovascular event rates when comparing atherectomy against balloon angioplasty with or without stenting. The limited evidence available does not support a significant advantage of atherectomy over conventional balloon angioplasty or stenting.\",\n          \"Interventions for preventing recurrent urinary tract infections during pregnancy\\nRecurrent urinary tract infections (RUTI) are common in women generally, and particularly in pregnant women. A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection of the urinary tract (bladder, kidneys) due to the presence of bacteria in the urine (bacteriuria). During pregnancy, UTI may be a serious complication that is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes for both mother and child including preterm birth and small\\u2010for\\u2010gestational\\u2010age babies. Therefore, it is important to define the optimal intervention for preventing RUTI during pregnancy to improve pregnancy outcomes. Interventions used to prevent RUTI in pregnant women can be pharmacological (antibiotics) or non\\u2010pharmacological (cranberry products, acupuncture, probiotics and behavioural modifications). So far, little is known about the best way to prevent RUTI in pregnant women. \\nThis review identified one study involving 200 pregnant women who received nitrofurantoin (antibiotics) and close surveillance (regular clinic visit, urine cultures and antibiotics when a positive culture was found) or close surveillance alone. Suppressive therapy with daily dose of nitrofurantoin and close surveillance was not shown to prevent RUTI compared with close surveillance alone but the evidence was of very low quality. A significant reduction of asymptomatic bacteriuria (presence of bacteria in the urine without the symptoms of a UTI) was found in women with a high clinic attendance rate who received nitrofurantoin and close surveillance. Due to lack of evidence no conclusions can be drawn. Future randomised controlled trials comparing different pharmacological and non\\u2010pharmacological interventions are necessary to assess the optimal intervention to prevent RUTI in women who are pregnant. Such trials should report on a comprehensive range of outcomes for both women and infants.\",\n          \"Blood thinners for the long\\u2010term treatment of blood clots in people with cancer\\nBackgroundPeople with cancer are at an increased risk of developing blood clots and might respond differently to different types of blood thinners (anticoagulants). \\nStudy characteristicsWe searched scientific databases for clinical trials looking at the effects of long\\u2010term treatment with different blood thinners on blood clot recurrence in people with cancer with a confirmed diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (a blood clot in the limbs) or pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in the lungs). We included trials with any type of cancer, and irrespective of the type of cancer treatment. The trials looked at survival, recurrent blood clot, bleeding and blood platelet levels (which are involved in blood clotting). The evidence was current to May 2021. \\nKey resultsWe found 18trials enrollingparticipants with cancer and blood clots. The studies found that low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs; a type of blood thinner that is injected into a vein) were superior to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; a type of blood thinner taken by mouth (oral)) in reducing the recurrence of blood clots. The available data did not provide a clear answer about the effects of these drugs on death and the side effect of bleeding. The studies also found that direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs; another type of blood thinner taken by mouth) might decrease the recurrence of blood clots compared to LMWH while increasing the risk of bleeding. There was no clear answer when comparing DOACs (a newer type of oral blood thinner) and VKAs (an older type of oral blood thinner) for death, blood clot recurrence and bleeding. \\nReliability of the evidenceWhen comparing LMWHs to VKAs, we judged the certainty of the evidence to be moderate for recurrent blood clots, death at one year and major bleeding, and low for minor bleeding. \\nWhen comparing DOACs to VKAs, we judged the certainty of the evidence to be low for death, recurrent blood clots and bleeding complications. \\nEditorial note: this is a living systematic review.

            "Mechanical ventilation is a critical component of paediatric intensive care therapy. It is indicated when the patient’s spontaneous ventilation is inadequate to sustain life. Weaning is the gradual reduction of ventilatory support and the transfer of respiratory control back to the patient. Weaning may represent a large proportion of the ventilatory period. Prolonged ventilation is associated with significant morbidity, hospital cost, psychosocial and physical risks to the child and even death. Timely and effective weaning may reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and may reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with prolonged ventilation. However, no consensus has been reached on criteria that can be used to identify when patients are ready to wean or the best way to achieve it. \n",

            "Plain Title: Does Weaning By Protocol Reduce Duration Of Mechanical Ventilation In Critically Ill Children? Rationale: Mechanical ventilation is a common treatment for critically ill children. When a child's breathing becomes too weak to keep them alive, they need help from a machine called a ventilator. This helps them breathe until their body can start breathing again. Weaning is the process of slowly reducing the amount of help the ventilator gives. Weaning may take several weeks or months. Some children do not get better after being on a ventilator for a long time. They may die or suffer serious complications. We want to know if there is a way to make weaning easier and faster so that more children can go home sooner. Our study looked at how well weaning by protocol works compared to usual care. A protocol is a set of rules that doctors use to guide their decisions about how to treat a patient. We wanted to see if using a protocol would shorten the time that children spend on a ventilator. We also wanted to find out if using a protocol had any effect on the outcome of the child's illness. Trial Design: The study involved 321 children aged 28 days to 17 years old. The children were randomly assigned to either receive standard care or care\n",

Atherectomy is an alternative procedure, in which atheroma is cut or ground away within the artery. This is the first update of a Cochrane Review published in 2014. \\nObjectives\\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of atherectomy for peripheral arterial disease compared to other established treatments. \\nSearch methods\\nThe Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED) databases, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 12 August 2019. \\nSelection criteria\\nWe included all randomised controlled trials that compared atherectomy with other established treatments. All participants had symptomatic PAD with either claudication or critical limb ischaemia and evidence of lower limb arterial disease. \\nData collection and analysis\\nTwo review authors screened studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and used GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence. We resolved any disagreements through discussion. Outcomes of interest were: primary patency (at six and 12 months), all\\u2010cause mortality, fatal and non\\u2010fatal cardiovascular events, initial technical failure rates, target vessel revascularisation rates (TVR; at six and 12 months); and complications. \\nMain results\\nWe included seven studies, with a total of 527 participants and 581 treated lesions. We found two comparisons: atherectomy versus balloon angioplasty (BA) and atherectomy versus BA with primary stenting. No studies compared atherectomy with bypass surgery. Overall, the evidence from this review was of very low certainty, due to a high risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency. \\nSix studies (372 participants, 427 treated lesions) compared atherectomy versus BA. We found no clear difference between atherectomy and BA for the primary outcomes: six\\u2010month primary patency rates (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 1.20; 3 studies, 186 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence); 12\\u2010month primary patency rates (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.84; 2 studies, 149 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) or mortality rates (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.66, 3 studies, 210 participants, very low\\u2010certainty evidence). One study reported cardiac failure and acute coronary syndrome as causes of death at 24 months but it was unclear which arm the participants belonged to, and one study reported no cardiovascular events. \\nThere was no clear difference when examining: initial technical failure rates (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.08; 6 studies, 425 treated vessels; very low\\u2010certainty evidence), six\\u2010month TVR (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.06 to 4.42; 2 studies, 136 treated vessels; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) or 12\\u2010month TVR (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.42; 3 studies, 176 treated vessels; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). All six studies reported complication rates (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.68; 6 studies, 387 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) and embolisation events (RR 2.51, 95% CI 0.64 to 9.80; 6 studies, 387 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). Atherectomy may be less likely to cause dissection (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.54; 4 studies, 290 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) and may be associated with a reduction in bailout stenting (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.74; 4 studies, 315 treated vessels; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). Four studies reported amputation rates, with only one amputation event recorded in a BA participant. We used subgroup analysis to compare the effect of plain balloons/stents and drug\\u2010eluting balloons/stents, but did not detect any differences between the subgroups. \\nOne study (155 participants, 155 treated lesions) compared atherectomy versus BA and primary stenting, so comparison was extremely limited and subject to imprecision. This study did not report primary patency. The study reported one death (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.23; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) and three complication events (RR 7.04, 95% CI 0.80 to 62.23; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) in a very small data set, making conclusions unreliable. We found no clear difference between the treatment arms in cardiovascular events (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.23; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). This study found no initial technical failure events, and TVR rates at six and 24 months showed little difference between treatment arms (RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.95 to 5.46; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence and RR 2.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 4.37; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence, respectively). \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nThis review update shows that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of atherectomy on patency, mortality and cardiovascular event rates compared to plain balloon angioplasty, with or without stenting. We detected no clear differences in initial technical failure rates or TVR, but there may be reduced dissection and bailout stenting after atherectomy although this is uncertain. Included studies were small, heterogenous and at high risk of bias. Larger studies powered to detect clinically meaningful, patient\\u2010centred outcomes are required.\",\n          \"The review included one trial involving 200 women and was at moderate to high risk of bias.The trial compared a daily dose of nitrofurantoin and close surveillance (regular clinic visit, urine cultures and antibiotics when a positive culture was found) with close surveillance only. No significant differences were found for the primary outcomes: recurrent pyelonephritis (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 2.53; one study, 167 women), RUTI before birth (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.38; one study, 167 women), and preterm birth (before 37 weeks) (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.35; one study, 147 women). The overall quality of evidence for these outcomes as assessed using GRADE was very low. There were no significant differences between the two comparison groups for any of the following secondary outcomes, birthweight less than 2500 (g) (RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.53 to 7.80; one study, 147 infants), birthweight (mean difference (MD) \\u2010113.00, 95% CI \\u2010327.20 to 101.20; one study, 147 infants), five\\u2010minute Apgar score less than seven (RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.87; one study, 147 infants) and miscarriages (RR 3.11, 95% CI 0.33 to 29.29; one study, 167 women). The evidence for these secondary outcomes was also of very low quality. The incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) (at least 103 colonies per mL) (secondary outcome), only reported in women with a clinic attendance rate of more than 90% (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.89; one study, 102 women), was significantly reduced in women who received nitrofurantoin and close surveillance. Data on total mortality and small\\u2010for\\u2010gestational\\u2010age babies were not reported.\",\n          \"Background\\nCancer increases the risk of thromboembolic events, especially in people receiving anticoagulation treatments. \\nObjectives\\nTo compare the efficacy and safety of low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), and other anticoagulants for the long\\u2010term treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in people with cancer. \\nSearch methods\\nWe conducted a literature search including a comprehensive electronic search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ), MEDLINE (Ovid), and Embase (Ovid); handsearching conference proceedings; checking references of included studies; and a search for ongoing studies in trial registries. As part of the living systematic review approach, we run searches continually, incorporating new evidence after it is identified. Last search date 14 May 2021. \\nSelection criteria\\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the benefits and harms of long\\u2010term treatment with LMWHs, DOACs, VKAs, or other anticoagulants in people with cancer and symptomatic VTE. \\nData collection and analysis\\nWe extracted data in duplicate on study characteristics and risk of bias. Outcomes included: all\\u2010cause mortality, recurrent VTE, major bleeding, minor bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and health\\u2010related quality of life (QoL). We assessed the certainty of the evidence at the outcome level following the GRADE approach (GRADE handbook). \\nMain results\\nOf 3583 citations,19 RCTs fulfilled the eligibility criteria.\\nLow molecular weight heparins versus vitamin K antagonistsEight studies enrolling 2327 participants compared LMWHs with VKAs. Meta\\u2010analysis of five studies probably did not rule out a beneficial or harmful effect of LMWHs compared to VKAs on mortality up to 12 months of follow\\u2010up (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.13; risk difference (RD) 0 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 45 fewer to 48 more; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence).

The study by Raskob did not rule out a beneficial or harmful effect of DOACs compared to LMWH on mortality up to 12 months of follow\\u2010up (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.25; RD 27 more per 1000, 95% CI 30 fewer to 95 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence). The data also showed that DOACs may have shown a likely reduction in VTE recurrence up to 12 months of follow\\u2010up compared to LMWH (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.01; RD 36 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 62 fewer to 1 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence). DOAC may have increased major bleeding at 12 months of follow\\u2010up compared to LMWH (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.88; RD 29 more per 1000, 95% CI 0 fewer to 78 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence) and likely increased minor bleeding up to 12 months of follow\\u2010up compared to LMWH (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.80; RD 35 more per 1000, 95% CI 6 fewer to 92 more; low\\u2010certainty evidence).

People with this condition can experience pain on walking, pain at rest, or leg ulceration due to poor blood supply. Treatment options are: surgery, using a blood vessel or graft to bypass the narrowed or blocked section of the artery; balloon angioplasty, when a deflated balloon is passed into the narrowing at the end of a wire, then blown up to stretch the artery; and stenting (used in addition to balloon angioplasty), which holds open the balloon\\u2010stretched section for extra support. A final option, less commonly used, is a technique called atherectomy. This treatment cuts or grinds away the fatty deposition (atheroma) within the artery that is causing the narrowing or occlusion. \\nKey results \\nIn this review, we compared atherectomy with the other treatment options described above. We also looked within the two groups to assess whether using drug\\u2010releasing balloons or stents impacted on participants' outcomes. We identified seven studies with a total of 527 participants. \\nSix trials compared atherectomy against balloon angioplasty (372 participants, 427 treated lesions). We found no clear difference between the procedures when examining artery patency at six and 12 months, risk of death, initial procedure failure rates, need to re\\u2010treat the artery, risk of forming clots (embolisation), complication rates or risk of amputation. We found that atherectomy was associated with lower rates of emergency stenting during the procedure and lower balloon inflation pressures when compared with balloon angioplasty alone. We found no difference in results depending on whether the balloons were drug\\u2010releasing or not. \\nOne study compared atherectomy against balloon angioplasty and primary stenting (155 participants and 155 treated lesions). This study did not report primary patency. We found no clear difference between the treatment arms in risk of death, complication rates, cardiovascular events and the need to re\\u2010treat the artery. This study found no initial procedure failure events, \\nWe did not find any studies that compared bypass surgery against atherectomy.\\nCertainty of the evidence \\nOverall, our certainty in the evidence is very low, which means we do not have confidence that our results show the true effect of the treatments. We downgraded our certainty in the evidence because the studies were at high risk of bias (lack of blinding of participants or assessors, several outcomes were not reported and a number of the participants did not complete the studies); the trials were all small; and their results were inconsistent. \\nConclusions \\nIn conclusion, we have found no clear difference in effect on patency, mortality or cardiovascular event rates when comparing atherectomy against balloon angioplasty with or without stenting. The limited evidence available does not support a significant advantage of atherectomy over conventional balloon angioplasty or stenting.\",\n          \"Interventions for preventing recurrent urinary tract infections during pregnancy\\nRecurrent urinary tract infections (RUTI) are common in women generally, and particularly in pregnant women. A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection of the urinary tract (bladder, kidneys) due to the presence of bacteria in the urine (bacteriuria). During pregnancy, UTI may be a serious complication that is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes for both mother and child including preterm birth and small\\u2010for\\u2010gestational\\u2010age babies. Therefore, it is important to define the optimal intervention for preventing RUTI during pregnancy to improve pregnancy outcomes. Interventions used to prevent RUTI in pregnant women can be pharmacological (antibiotics) or non\\u2010pharmacological (cranberry products, acupuncture, probiotics and behavioural modifications). So far, little is known about the best way to prevent RUTI in pregnant women. \\nThis review identified one study involving 200 pregnant women who received nitrofurantoin (antibiotics) and close surveillance (regular clinic visit, urine cultures and antibiotics when a positive culture was found) or close surveillance alone. Suppressive therapy with daily dose of nitrofurantoin and close surveillance was not shown to prevent RUTI compared with close surveillance alone but the evidence was of very low quality. A significant reduction of asymptomatic bacteriuria (presence of bacteria in the urine without the symptoms of a UTI) was found in women with a high clinic attendance rate who received nitrofurantoin and close surveillance. Due to lack of evidence no conclusions can be drawn. Future randomised controlled trials comparing different pharmacological and non\\u2010pharmacological interventions are necessary to assess the optimal intervention to prevent RUTI in women who are pregnant. Such trials should report on a comprehensive range of outcomes for both women and infants.\",\n          \"Blood thinners for the long\\u2010term treatment of blood clots in people with cancer\\nBackgroundPeople with cancer are at an increased risk of developing blood clots and might respond differently to different types of blood thinners (anticoagulants). \\nStudy characteristicsWe searched scientific databases for clinical trials looking at the effects of long\\u2010term treatment with different blood thinners on blood clot recurrence in people with cancer with a confirmed diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (a blood clot in the limbs) or pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in the lungs). We included trials with any type of cancer, and irrespective of the type of cancer treatment. The trials looked at survival, recurrent blood clot, bleeding and blood platelet levels (which are involved in blood clotting). The evidence was current to May 2021. \\nKey resultsWe found 18trials enrollingparticipants with cancer and blood clots. The studies found that low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs; a type of blood thinner that is injected into a vein) were superior to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; a type of blood thinner taken by mouth (oral)) in reducing the recurrence of blood clots. The available data did not provide a clear answer about the effects of these drugs on death and the side effect of bleeding. The studies also found that direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs; another type of blood thinner taken by mouth) might decrease the recurrence of blood clots compared to LMWH while increasing the risk of bleeding. There was no clear answer when comparing DOACs (a newer type of oral blood thinner) and VKAs (an older type of oral blood thinner) for death, blood clot recurrence and bleeding. \\nReliability of the evidenceWhen comparing LMWHs to VKAs, we judged the certainty of the evidence to be moderate for recurrent blood clots, death at one year and major bleeding, and low for minor bleeding. \\nWhen comparing DOACs to VKAs, we judged the certainty of the evidence to be low for death, recurrent blood clots and bleeding complications. \\nEditorial note: this is a living systematic review.

Atherectomy is an alternative procedure, in which atheroma is cut or ground away within the artery. This is the first update of a Cochrane Review published in 2014. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of atherectomy for peripheral arterial disease compared to other established treatments. Search methods The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED) databases, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 12 August 2019. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials that compared atherectomy with other established treatments. All participants had symptomatic PAD with either claudication or critical limb ischaemia and evidence of lower limb arterial disease. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and used GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence. We resolved any disagreements through discussion. Outcomes of interest were: primary patency (at six and 12 months), all\\u2010cause mortality, fatal and non\\u2010fatal cardiovascular events, initial technical failure rates, target vessel revascularisation rates (TVR; at six and 12 months); and complications. Main results We included seven studies, with a total of 527 participants and 581 treated lesions. We found two comparisons: atherectomy versus balloon angioplasty (BA) and atherectomy versus BA with primary stenting. No studies compared atherectomy [...] amputation event recorded in a BA participant. We used subgroup analysis to compare the effect of plain balloons/stents and drug\\u2010eluting balloons/stents, but did not detect any differences between the subgroups. One study (155 participants, 155 treated lesions) compared atherectomy versus BA and primary stenting, so comparison was extremely limited and subject to imprecision. This study did not report primary patency. The study reported one death (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.23; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) and three complication events (RR 7.04, 95% CI 0.80 to 62.23; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) in a very small data set, making conclusions unreliable. We found no clear difference between the treatment arms in cardiovascular events (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.23; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). This study found no initial technical failure events, and TVR rates at six and 24 months showed little difference between treatment arms (RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.95 to 5.46; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence and RR 2.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 4.37; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence, respectively). Authors' conclusions This review update shows that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of atherectomy on patency, mortality and cardiovascular event rates compared to plain balloon angioplasty, with or without stenting. We detected no clear differences in initial technical failure rates or TVR, but there may be reduced dissection and bailout stenting after atherectomy although this is uncertain. Included studies were small, heterogenous and at high risk of bias. Larger studies powered to detect clinically meaningful, patient\\u2010centred outcomes are required.\",\n          \"The review included one trial involving 200 women and was at moderate to high risk of bias.The trial compared a daily dose of nitrofurantoin and close surveillance (regular clinic visit, urine cultures and antibiotics when a positive culture was found) with close surveillance only. No significant differences were found for the primary outcomes: recurrent pyelonephritis (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 2.53; one study, 167 women), RUTI before birth (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.38; one study, 167 women), and preterm birth (before 37 weeks) (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.35; one study, 147 women). The overall quality of evidence for these outcomes as assessed using GRADE was very low. There were no significant differences between the two comparison groups for any of the following secondary outcomes, birthweight less than 2500 (g) (RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.53 to 7.80; one study, 147 infants), birthweight (mean difference (MD) \\u2010113.00, 95% CI \\u2010327.20 to 101.20; one study, 147 infants), five\\u2010minute Apgar score less than seven (RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.87; one study, 147 infants) and miscarriages (RR 3.11, 95% CI 0.33 to 29.29; one study, 167 women). The evidence for these secondary outcomes was also of very low quality. The incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) (at least 103 colonies per mL) (secondary outcome), only reported in women with a clinic attendance rate of more than 90% (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.89; one study, 102 women), was significantly reduced in women who received nitrofurantoin and close surveillance.

These events are more common in people who receive certain medications called anticoagulants. Anticoagulants help prevent blood clots from forming, but they also increase the risk of bleeding. People with cancer often need to take these medications to prevent blood clots, but there is limited understanding about how different types of anticoagulants work together.

            "To assess the effectiveness and safety of tonsillectomy (with or without adenoidectomy) compared with non‐surgical treatment in the management of children with PFAPA. \n",
            "Search methods\n",
            "The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2019, Issue 4); PubMed; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 15 October 2019. \n",
            "Selection criteria\n",
            "Randomised controlled trials comparing tonsillectomy (with or without adenoidectomy) with non‐surgical treatment in children with PFAPA. \n",
            "Data collection and analysis\n",
            "We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes were the proportion of children whose symptoms have completely resolved and complications of surgery (haemorrhage and number of days of postoperative pain). Secondary outcomes were: number of episodes of fever and the associated symptoms; severity of episodes; use of corticosteroids; absence or time off school; quality of life. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. \n",
            "Main results\n",
            "Two trials were included with a total of 67 children randomised (65 analysed); we judged both to be at low risk of bias. \n",
            "One trial of 39 participants recruited children with PFAPA syndrome diagnosed according to rigid, standard criteria. The trial compared adenotonsillectomy to watchful waiting and followed up patients for 18 months. A smaller trial of 28 children applied less stringent criteria for diagnosing PFAPA and probably also included participants with alternative types of recurrent pharyngitis. This trial compared tonsillectomy alone to no treatment and followed up patients for six months. \n",
            "Combining the trial results suggests that patients with PFAPA likely experience less fever and less severe episodes after surgery compared to those receiving no surgery. The risk ratio (RR) for immediate resolution of symptoms after surgery that persisted until the end of follow‐up was 4.38 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 30.11); number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 2, calculated based on an estimate that 156 in 1000 untreated children have a resolution) (moderate‐certainty evidence). Both trials reported that there were no complications of surgery. However, the numbers of patients randomly allocated to surgery (19 and 14 patients respectively) were too small to detect potentially important complications such as haemorrhage. \n",
            "Surgery probably results in a large overall reduction in the average number of episodes over the total length of follow‐up (rate ratio 0.08, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.13), reducing the average frequency of PFAPA episodes from one every two months to slightly less than one every two years (moderate‐certainty evidence). Surgery also likely reduces severity, as indicated by the length of PFAPA symptoms during these episodes. One study reported that the average number of days per PFAPA episode was 1.7 days after receiving surgery, compared to 3.5 days in the control group (moderate‐certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that the proportion of patients requiring corticosteroids was also lower in the surgery group compared to those receiving no surgery (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.92) (low‐certainty evidence). \n",
            "Other outcomes such as absence from school and quality of life were not measured or reported. \n",
            "Authors' conclusions\n",
            "The evidence for the effectiveness of tonsillectomy in children with PFAPA syndrome is derived from two small randomised controlled trials. These trials reported significant beneficial effects of surgery compared to no surgery on immediate and complete symptom resolution (NNTB = 2) and a substantial reduction in the frequency and severity (length of episode) of any further symptoms experienced. However, the evidence is of moderate certainty (further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate) due to the relatively small sample sizes of the studies and some concerns about the applicability of the results. Therefore, the parents and carers of children with PFAPA syndrome must weigh the risks and consequences of surgery against the alternative of using medications. It is well established that children with PFAPA syndrome recover spontaneously and medication can be administered to try and reduce the severity of individual episodes. It is uncertain whether adenoidectomy combined with tonsillectomy adds any additional benefit to tonsillectomy alone.\n"

Atherectomy is an alternative procedure, in which atheroma is cut or ground away within the artery. This is the first update of a Cochrane Review published in 2014. \\nObjectives\\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of atherectomy for peripheral arterial disease compared to other established treatments. \\nSearch methods\\nThe Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED) databases, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 12 August 2019. \\nSelection criteria\\nWe included all randomised controlled trials that compared atherectomy with other established treatments. All participants had symptomatic PAD with either claudication or critical limb ischaemia and evidence of lower limb arterial disease. \\nData collection and analysis\\nTwo review authors screened studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and used GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence. We resolved any disagreements through discussion. Outcomes of interest were: primary patency (at six and 12 months), all\\u2010cause mortality, fatal and non\\u2010fatal cardiovascular events, initial technical failure rates, target vessel revascularisation rates (TVR; at six and 12 months); and complications. \\nMain results\\nWe included seven studies, with a total of 527 participants and 581 treated lesions. We found two comparisons: atherectomy versus balloon angioplasty (BA) and atherectomy versus BA with primary stenting. No studies compared atherectomy with bypass surgery. Overall, the evidence from this review was of very low certainty, due to a high risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency. \\nSix studies (372 participants, 427 treated lesions) compared atherectomy versus BA. We found no clear difference between atherectomy and BA for the primary outcomes: six\\u2010month primary patency rates (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 1.20; 3 studies, 186 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence); 12\\u2010month primary patency rates (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.84; 2 studies, 149 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) or mortality rates (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.66, 3 studies, 210 participants, very low\\u2010certainty evidence). One study reported cardiac failure and acute coronary syndrome as causes of death at 24 months but it was unclear which arm the participants belonged to, and one study reported no cardiovascular events. \\nThere was no clear difference when examining: initial technical failure rates (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.08; 6 studies, 425 treated vessels; very low\\u2010certainty evidence), six\\u2010month TVR (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.06 to 4.42; 2 studies, 136 treated vessels; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) or 12\\u2010month TVR (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.42; 3 studies, 176 treated vessels; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). All six studies reported complication rates (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.68; 6 studies, 387 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) and embolisation events (RR 2.51, 95% CI 0.64 to 9.80; 6 studies, 387 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). Atherectomy may be less likely to cause dissection (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.54; 4 studies, 290 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) and may be associated with a reduction in bailout stenting (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.74; 4 studies, 315 treated vessels; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). Four studies reported amputation rates, with only one amputation event recorded in a BA participant. We used subgroup analysis to compare the effect of plain balloons/stents and drug\\u2010eluting balloons/stents, but did not detect any differences between the subgroups. \\nOne study (155 participants, 155 treated lesions) compared atherectomy versus BA and primary stenting, so comparison was extremely limited and subject to imprecision. This study did not report primary patency. The study reported one death (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.23; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) and three complication events (RR 7.04, 95% CI 0.80 to 62.23; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) in a very small data set, making conclusions unreliable. We found no clear difference between the treatment arms in cardiovascular events (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.23; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). This study found no initial technical failure events, and TVR rates at six and 24 months showed little difference between treatment arms (RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.95 to 5.46; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence and RR 2.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 4.37; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence, respectively). \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nThis review update shows that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of atherectomy on patency, mortality and cardiovascular event rates compared to plain balloon angioplasty, with or without stenting. We detected no clear differences in initial technical failure rates or TVR, but there may be reduced dissection and bailout stenting after atherectomy although this is uncertain. Included studies were small, heterogenous and at high risk of bias. Larger studies powered to detect clinically meaningful, patient\\u2010centred outcomes are required.\",\n          \"The review included one trial involving 200 women and was at moderate to high risk of bias.The trial compared a daily dose of nitrofurantoin and close surveillance (regular clinic visit, urine cultures and antibiotics when a positive culture was found) with close surveillance only. No significant differences were found for the primary outcomes: recurrent pyelonephritis (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 2.53; one study, 167 women), RUTI before birth (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.38; one study, 167 women), and preterm birth (before 37 weeks) (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.35; one study, 147 women). The overall quality of evidence for these outcomes as assessed using GRADE was very low. There were no significant differences between the two comparison groups for any of the following secondary outcomes, birthweight less than 2500 (g) (RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.53 to 7.80; one study, 147 infants), birthweight (mean difference (MD) \\u2010113.00, 95% CI \\u2010327.20 to 101.20; one study, 147 infants), five\\u2010minute Apgar score less than seven (RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.87; one study, 147 infants) and miscarriages (RR 3.11, 95% CI 0.33 to 29.29; one study, 167 women). The evidence for these secondary outcomes was also of very low quality. The incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) (at least 103 colonies per mL) (secondary outcome), only reported in women with a clinic attendance rate of more than 90% (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.89; one study, 102 women), was significantly reduced in women who received nitrofurantoin and close surveillance.

People with this condition can experience pain on walking, pain at rest, or leg ulceration due to poor blood supply. Treatment options are: surgery, using a blood vessel or graft to bypass the narrowed or blocked section of the artery; balloon angioplasty, when a deflated balloon is passed into the narrowing at the end of a wire, then blown up to stretch the artery; and stenting (used in addition to balloon angioplasty), which holds open the balloon\\u2010stretched section for extra support. A final option, less commonly used, is a technique called atherectomy. This treatment cuts or grinds away the fatty deposition (atheroma) within the artery that is causing the narrowing or occlusion. \\nKey results \\nIn this review, we compared atherectomy with the other treatment options described above. We also looked within the two groups to assess whether using drug\\u2010releasing balloons or stents impacted on participants' outcomes. We identified seven studies with a total of 527 participants. \\nSix trials compared atherectomy against balloon angioplasty (372 participants, 427 treated lesions). We found no clear difference between the procedures when examining artery patency at six and 12 months, risk of death, initial procedure failure rates, need to re\\u2010treat the artery, risk of forming clots (embolisation), complication rates or risk of amputation. We found that atherectomy was associated with lower rates of emergency stenting during the procedure and lower balloon inflation pressures when compared with balloon angioplasty alone. We found no difference in results depending on whether the balloons were drug\\u2010releasing or not. \\nOne study compared atherectomy against balloon angioplasty and primary stenting (155 participants and 155 treated lesions). This study did not report primary patency. We found no clear difference between the treatment arms in risk of death, complication rates, cardiovascular events and the need to re\\u2010treat the artery. This study found no initial procedure failure events, \\nWe did not find any studies that compared bypass surgery against atherectomy.\\nCertainty of the evidence \\nOverall, our certainty in the evidence is very low, which means we do not have confidence that our results show the true effect of the treatments. We downgraded our certainty in the evidence because the studies were at high risk of bias (lack of blinding of participants or assessors, several outcomes were not reported and a number of the participants did not complete the studies); the trials were all small; and their results were inconsistent. \\nConclusions \\nIn conclusion, we have found no clear difference in effect on patency, mortality or cardiovascular event rates when comparing atherectomy against balloon angioplasty with or without stenting. The limited evidence available does not support a significant advantage of atherectomy over conventional balloon angioplasty or stenting.\",\n          \"Interventions for preventing recurrent urinary tract infections during pregnancy\\nRecurrent urinary tract infections (RUTI) are common in women generally, and particularly in pregnant women. A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection of the urinary tract (bladder, kidneys) due to the presence of bacteria in the urine (bacteriuria). During pregnancy, UTI may be a serious complication that is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes for both mother and child including preterm birth and small\\u2010for\\u2010gestational\\u2010age babies. Therefore, it is important to define the optimal intervention for preventing RUTI during pregnancy to improve pregnancy outcomes. Interventions used to prevent RUTI in pregnant women can be pharmacological (antibiotics) or non\\u2010pharmacological (cranberry products, acupuncture, probiotics and behavioural modifications). So far, little is known about the best way to prevent RUTI in pregnant women. \\nThis review identified one study involving 200 pregnant women who received nitrofurantoin (antibiotics) and close surveillance (regular clinic visit, urine cultures and antibiotics when a positive culture was found) or close surveillance alone. Suppressive therapy with daily dose of nitrofurantoin and close surveillance was not shown to prevent RUTI compared with close surveillance alone but the evidence was of very low quality. A significant reduction of asymptomatic bacteriuria (presence of bacteria in the urine without the symptoms of a UTI) was found in women with a high clinic attendance rate who received nitrofurantoin and close surveillance. Due to lack of evidence no conclusions can be drawn. Future randomised controlled trials comparing different pharmacological and non\\u2010pharmacological interventions are necessary to assess the optimal intervention to prevent RUTI in women who are pregnant. Such trials should report on a comprehensive range of outcomes for both women and infants.\",\n          \"Blood thinners for the long\\u2010term treatment of blood clots in people with cancer\\nBackgroundPeople with cancer are at an increased risk of developing blood clots and might respond differently to different types of blood thinners (anticoagulants). \\nStudy characteristicsWe searched scientific databases for clinical trials looking at the effects of long\\u2010term treatment with different blood thinners on blood clot recurrence in people with cancer with a confirmed diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (a blood clot in the limbs) or pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in the lungs). We included trials with any type of cancer, and irrespective of the type of cancer treatment. The trials looked at survival, recurrent blood clot, bleeding and blood platelet levels (which are involved in blood clotting). The evidence was current to May 2021. \\nKey resultsWe found 18trials enrollingparticipants with cancer and blood clots. The studies found that low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs; a type of blood thinner that is injected into a vein) were superior to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; a type of blood thinner taken by mouth (oral)) in reducing the recurrence of blood clots. The available data did not provide a clear answer about the effects of these drugs on death and the side effect of bleeding. The studies also found that direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs; another type of blood thinner taken by mouth) might decrease the recurrence of blood clots compared to LMWH while increasing the risk of bleeding. There was no clear answer when comparing DOACs (a newer type of oral blood thinner) and VKAs (an older type of oral blood thinner) for death, blood clot recurrence and bleeding. \\nReliability of the evidenceWhen comparing LMWHs to VKAs, we judged the certainty of the evidence to be moderate for recurrent blood clots, death at one year and major bleeding, and low for minor bleeding. \\nWhen comparing DOACs to VKAs, we judged the certainty of the evidence to be low for death, recurrent blood clots and bleeding complications. \\nEditorial note: this is a living systematic review.

Atherectomy is an alternative procedure, in which atheroma is cut or ground away within the artery. This is the first update of a Cochrane Review published in 2014. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of atherectomy for peripheral arterial disease compared to other established treatments. Search methods The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED) databases, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 12 August 2019. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials that compared atherectomy with other established treatments. All participants had symptomatic PAD with either claudication or critical limb ischaemia and evidence of lower limb arterial disease. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and used GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence. We resolved any disagreements through discussion. Outcomes of interest were: primary patency (at six and 12 months), all\\u2010cause mortality, fatal and non\\u2010fatal cardiovascular events, initial technical failure rates, target vessel revascularisation rates (TVR; at six and 12 months); and complications. Main results We included seven studies, with a total of 527 participants and 581 treated lesions. We found two comparisons: atherectomy versus balloon angioplasty (BA) and atherectomy versus BA with primary stenting. No studies compared atherectomy [...] amputation event recorded in a BA participant. We used subgroup analysis to compare the effect of plain balloons/stents and drug\\u2010eluting balloons/stents, but did not detect any differences between the subgroups. One study (155 participants, 155 treated lesions) compared atherectomy versus BA and primary stenting, so comparison was extremely limited and subject to imprecision. This study did not report primary patency. The study reported one death (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.23; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) and three complication events (RR 7.04, 95% CI 0.80 to 62.23; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence) in a very small data set, making conclusions unreliable. We found no clear difference between the treatment arms in cardiovascular events (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.23; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). This study found no initial technical failure events, and TVR rates at six and 24 months showed little difference between treatment arms (RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.95 to 5.46; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence and RR 2.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 4.37; 155 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence, respectively). Authors' conclusions This review update shows that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of atherectomy on patency, mortality and cardiovascular event rates compared to plain balloon angioplasty, with or without stenting. We detected no clear differences in initial technical failure rates or TVR, but there may be reduced dissection and bailout stenting after atherectomy although this is uncertain. Included studies were small, heterogenous and at high risk of bias. Larger studies powered to detect clinically meaningful, patient\\u2010centred outcomes are required.\",\n          \"The review included one trial involving 200 women and was at moderate to high risk of bias.The trial compared a daily dose of nitrofurantoin and close surveillance (regular clinic visit, urine cultures and antibiotics when a positive culture was found) with close surveillance only.

The overall quality of evidence for these outcomes as assessed using GRADE was very low. There were no significant differences between the two comparison groups for any of the following secondary outcomes, birthweight less than 2500 (g) (RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.53 to 7.80; one study, 147 infants), birthweight (mean difference (MD) \\u2010113.00, 95% CI \\u2010327.20 to 101.20; one study, 147 infants), five\\u2010minute Apgar score less than seven (RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.87; one study, 147 infants) and miscarriages (RR 3.11, 95% CI 0.33 to 29.29; one study, 167 women). The evidence for these secondary outcomes was also of very low quality. The incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) (at least 103 colonies per mL) (secondary outcome), only reported in women with a clinic attendance rate of more than 90% (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.89; one study, 102 women), was significantly reduced in women who received nitrofurantoin and close surveillance.

It involved 200 women who had been diagnosed with urinary tract infections. The researchers wanted to see if giving them a medicine called nitrofurantoin would help prevent future infections. They compared the women who took nitrofurantoin with those who did not take it. The women who took nitrofurantoin had fewer urinary tract infections during pregnancy. However, there was no difference in other outcomes like premature births, low birth weight, or miscarriage rates. The study was done over a period of 12 months. The participants were aged 16 to 40 years old. Most of the women were white. The study was conducted in the United States.

This happens because cancer cells release substances that make blood clotting easier. Anticoagulant medications are used to prevent blood clots. These medicines work by slowing down the process of blood clotting. There are different types of anticoagulant medications. Some of them are taken orally, while others are injected under the skin. One type of anticoagulant medication is called low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). Another type is called direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC). The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of different types of anticoagulant medications for treating VTE in people with cancer. The researchers want to know if one type of anticoagulant medication is better than another for preventing blood clots and reducing the risk of complications like major bleeding.
